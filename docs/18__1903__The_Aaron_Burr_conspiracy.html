<p>Preface
</p>
<p>FOR a century the conspiracy, of Aaron Burr has
</p>
<p>been a puzzHng theme. Apart from the distin-
</p>
<p>guished figures that move across its stage, the
</p>
<p>nature of the enterprise from its very extravagance
</p>
<p>must always engage the attention of those who care
</p>
<p>to know something of the United States in its Heroic
</p>
<p>Age.
</p>
<p>The conspiracy was of much wider and deeper origin
</p>
<p>than has been usually supposed, and the conditions
</p>
<p>which gave rise to it, as well as the events with which
</p>
<p>it was vitally connected, have received scant treatment
</p>
<p>from historians. Social and political upheavals are not
</p>
<p>growths of a night, but are the results of the workings
</p>
<p>of real and definite causes which are traceable in every
</p>
<p>case and susceptible of some degree of analysis. Burr's
</p>
<p>project is no exception to this general law. And hap-
</p>
<p>pily we are now far enough removed from his time to
</p>
<p>see more clearly the perspective of events, and to
</p>
<p>measure with more certainty the motives and conduct
</p>
<p>of men.
</p>
<p>In the discussion of the subject writers have in nearly
</p>
<p>every case failed to distinguish between the conspiracy
</p>
<p>and Aaron Burr  in other words, they have attempted

</p>
<p>PREFACE
</p>
<p>to explain it through the character of Burr himself,
</p>
<p>a procedure which is fundamentally erroneous. Burr's
</p>
<p>character was apparently never more seriously involved,
</p>
<p>and never reflected more disastrously upon the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, than in the correspondence of Merry and Yrujo
</p>
<p>  the ministers respectively of Great Britain and Spain
</p>
<p> to whom he ostensibly disclosed his designs. If the
</p>
<p>revelations of the ministers could be accepted at their
</p>
<p>face value, treason was in Burr's mind, and the separa-
</p>
<p>tion of the West from the Union was his plot, open
</p>
<p>and avowed. However, viewing the correspondence
</p>
<p>as a whole, in conjunction with other facts which
</p>
<p>cannot here be discussed, it appears certain that Burr's
</p>
<p>intrigue with Merry and Yrujo w^as but a consummate
</p>
<p>piece of imposture. In order to secure funds for the
</p>
<p>carrying out of his expedition against Mexico, Burr
</p>
<p>resorted to the expedient of playing on the hatred of the
</p>
<p>European powers for the American Republic. Could
</p>
<p>they be brought to contribute moneys to aid in the
</p>
<p>sundering of the States? Burr thought so, and to
</p>
<p>secure the sum he conceived to be necessary for his
</p>
<p>purposes he never scrupled at discoursing of treasons,
</p>
<p>although at the moment every step he was taking
</p>
<p>looked toward an invasion of the Spanish territories.
</p>
<p>No weight can be placed upon Merry's and Yrujo's
</p>
<p>letters as concerns the nature of the conspiracy, except
</p>
<p>indeed in a negative sense ; and I say this with all defer-
</p>
<p>ence to Mr. Henry Adams and those who have laid so

</p>
<p>much stress on these manuscripts, maintaining that they
</p>
<p>PREFACE IX
</p>
<p>lay bare the heart of the conspiracy. The heart of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, however, was far removed from any com-
</p>
<p>munication of Burr's. The conspiracy was an affection
</p>
<p>of society  Burr was but a member of that society, an
</p>
<p>agent. It follows that if the nature of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>is to be disclosed, it can only be through an examination
</p>
<p>into the state of that society whose social, political, and
</p>
<p>traditional affiliations gave rise to it. This is basic.
</p>
<p>That the ideas of Burr, whatever they may have been,
</p>
<p>necessarily betray the secret of the movement, cannot
</p>
<p>be successfully maintained. But that the prevailing
</p>
<p>impression of Burr's character lent weight to the impu-
</p>
<p>tation of treason cannot be doubted ; nor more can it
</p>
<p>be doubted that the isolation of the West, together with
</p>
<p>the ignorance of the East concerning the pioneers
</p>
<p>who built their log cabins in the wilderness beyond the
</p>
<p>Alleghany Mountains, tended to distort extraordinarily
</p>
<p>the affair in the public mind. What were the ideas,
</p>
<p>then, prevailing in the Western country? Was there
</p>
<p>a contingent that plotted disunion ? Was there a party
</p>
<p>that clamored loudly for war against whatever power
</p>
<p>insulted the Republic? Of the first there is no trace
</p>
<p>worth considering; of the latter there is evidence in
</p>
<p>abundance. The spirit of the Westerners is proclaimed
</p>
<p>in no uncertain voice, and if its tone could have been
</p>
<p>mistaken in 1806, there was no doubting its meaning in
</p>
<p>18 12, when, in spite of the opposition of New England,
</p>
<p>the Second War with Great Britain was forced.

</p>
<p>And yet this was done by the very men upon whom
</p>
<p>PREFACE
</p>
<p>Burr had counted, and the greatest leaders in that
</p>
<p>struggle had been his associates. If we look more
</p>
<p>closely we shall see, what has been but too timidly sug-
</p>
<p>gested, that it was the West and South that took up the
</p>
<p>burden of the Republic when it had well nigh wearied
</p>
<p>of the load.
</p>
<p>As for the conspiracy, patriotism was but one of its
</p>
<p>elements. For him who reads the secret of the Anglo-
</p>
<p>Saxon character, there is epitomized in the movement
</p>
<p>the whole course of the race that threw down the bul-
</p>
<p>warks of Rome, that terrorized Europe in a Viking's
</p>
<p>fleet, that conquered the Western World, and that looks
</p>
<p>confidently forward to the time when the struggle for
</p>
<p>universal supremacy shall test its powers. Expansion
</p>
<p> conquest  was the keynote of the conspiracy ;  it is
</p>
<p>the keynote of the history of the race.
</p>
<p>This narrative of the conspiracy of Aaron Burr has
</p>
<p>been in large part written from original and hitherto
</p>
<p>unused sources of information. It must not be thought,
</p>
<p>however, that the work of scholars in this field has
</p>
<p>been ignored ; on the contrary, I have made much use
</p>
<p>of it, but never intentionally without due credit
</p>
<p>either in text or notes. I have not found it expedient,
</p>
<p>however, to point out even the most glaring anachro-
</p>
<p>nisms in many of the secondary narratives which treat
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy ; much less have I attempted to indi-
</p>
<p>cate divergences of opinion  and there are divergences
</p>
<p>as wide as misdemeanor is from treason.

<p>In the endeavor to make this study exhaustive much
</p>
<p>PREFACE xi
</p>
<p>time has been expended in searching for new data.
</p>
<p>Brief mention must therefore be made of the various
</p>
<p>sources which have been consulted, and of the materials
</p>
<p>exploited.
</p>
<p>In 1896 documents relating to the conspiracy were
</p>
<p>discovered in the Bexar Archives at San Antonio, the
</p>
<p>Spanish capital of the Province of Texas. From
</p>
<p>early in the eighteenth century, much of the correspond-
</p>
<p>ence of the provincial Governors with the Captains-
</p>
<p>General and Viceroys of Mexico found lodgment in the
</p>
<p>musty files of the archives of the province. It is need-
</p>
<p>less to say that they contain many manuscripts which
</p>
<p>are concerned with the westward growth of the
</p>
<p>United States and with the uninterrupted conflict which
</p>
<p>was waged with the retreating civilization of Spain. The
</p>
<p>views of the officers of Carlos IV. in that quarter as
</p>
<p>to the nature of the conspiracy are illuminating. They
</p>
<p>rightly classed it as a manifestation of the restless,
</p>
<p>encroaching activity of the nation which fate had
</p>
<p>placed on their borders.
</p>
<p>The archives of the State of Texas contain materials
</p>
<p>dating from the Spanish regime and are of value on
</p>
<p>more than one doubtful point.
</p>
<p>The Viceroyalty of Mexico on account of the promi-
</p>
<p>nent position it held among the Spanish colonies became
</p>
<p>the great center for the accumulation of official corre-
</p>
<p>spondence; and the treasure of manuscripts now con-
</p>
<p>tained in the Archivo General de Mexico, Mexico City,

<p>is of inestimable value to the history of the New
</p>
<p>xii PREFACE
</p>
<p>World, and in an almost equal measure to that of
</p>
<p>Europe. Although we have ignored as far as possible
</p>
<p>the presence of the Spanish civilization in the affairs of
</p>
<p>America, and have remained blind to the tremendous
</p>
<p>formative and directive influence which it has exerted
</p>
<p>on the course of our national growth, it is from this
</p>
<p>collection that our own history is to be enriched and
</p>
<p>brought nearer to truth. The Departments of Marine,
</p>
<p>War, and the Provinces, together with the correspond-
</p>
<p>ence which passed between the Viceroys of New Spain
</p>
<p>and the home Government deserve special mention. In
</p>
<p>the latter collection are letters from Viceroy Jose de
</p>
<p>Iturrigaray to Don Pedro Cevallos, then Minister of
</p>
<p>State, which go a long way toward explaining the con-
</p>
<p>duct of General James Wilkinson at the crisis on the
</p>
<p>Sabine in November, 1806. The cloudy transactions
</p>
<p>which resulted in the lamentable Neutral Ground
</p>
<p>Treaty and in the over- vaunted defeat of Burr are
</p>
<p>somewhat cleared of the mist which has enshrouded
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>The Mississippi Valley also proved a fruitful field
</p>
<p>for research. New Orleans was the focus for the vari-
</p>
<p>ous lines of forces which mingled in the conspiracy:
</p>
<p>it was the home of the Creoles who are supposed to
</p>
<p>have been at the heart of the plot ; it was the place, if
</p>
<p>we follow generally accepted conclusions, specially de-
</p>
<p>signed by the adventurers for plunder; and it had the
</p>
<p>unenviable distinction to be subjected for two months

</p>
<p>are files of the Moniteur de la Louisiane and of the
</p>
<p>Orleans Gazette, both of which newspapers were pub-
</p>
<p>Hshed contemporaneously with the conspiracy. The
</p>
<p>former was the organ of the Creole population, the
</p>
<p>latter represented the Americans proper, while both
</p>
<p>contain, apart from valuable documentary evidence, a
</p>
<p>trustworthy reflection of the public mind of the time.
</p>
<p>It is needless to say that much new light is shed on
</p>
<p>that dark chapter in the history of the conspiracy which
</p>
<p>is concerned with the attitude of the native Louisianians
</p>
<p>toward Burr, and with Wilkinson's reign of terror in
</p>
<p>the capital of Orleans. The official manuscript Journal
</p>
<p>of W. C. C. Claiborne, the first Governor of the Terri-
</p>
<p>tory, preserved in the old Tulane Law Library, is of
</p>
<p>exceeding interest, containing as it does much of his
</p>
<p>correspondence with the National Government, Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, and others.
</p>
<p>Colonel R. T. Durrett of Louisville has in his splen-
</p>

</p>
<p>newspaper published at Frankfort, Kentucky, and
</p>
<p>edited by William Hunter. In it are voiced the early
</p>
<p>controversies that rent Kentucky society, which has
</p>
<p>always been regarded as rife with disaffection. Most
</p>
<p>of the sensational articles concerning Burr, Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>and the Spanish Association, which appeared in the
</p>
<p>Western World, an incendiary newspaper established
</p>

</p>
<p>portant source is the Lexington Gazette  a file of which
</p>
<p>is preserved in the Lexington PubHc Library  one of
</p>
<p>the most influential journals of the early West. Its
</p>
<p>columns, like those of the Palladium, were devoted to
</p>
<p>combating the inflammatory reports which appeared
</p>
<p>weekly in the Western World, and to asserting the
</p>
<p>patriotism of the frontiersmen.
</p>
<p>The letters cited from the Andrew Jackson MS S. are
</p>
<p>of moment, for the relations which subsisted between
</p>
<p>Jackson and Burr have been so distorted and amplified
</p>
<p>that any approximation to the truth is to be welcomed.
</p>
<p>I am obliged to Messrs. Woodbury and Gist Blair for
</p>
<p>transcripts of the original documents.
</p>
<p>The Henry Clay MSS. and the Breckenridge Letters
</p>
<p>were opened to my inspection, and it is a pleasure to
</p>
<p>express my gratitude to Thomas Clay, Esq., and to
</p>
<p>Colonel W. C. P. Breckenridge for their respective
</p>
<p>services in this connection.
</p>
<p>The Jefferson and Madison MSS. have been ex-
</p>
<p>amined with profit. Moreover, the Department of
</p>
<p>State at Washington, contains a notable volume entitled
</p>
<p>"Letters in Relation to Burr's Conspiracy," the con-
</p>
<p>tents of which, so far as I can ascertain, have never been
</p>
<p>made public. The letters are from various sources, and
</p>
<p>many of them are extremely significant, serving to
</p>
<p>make clearer the whole view of the conspiracy, espe-
</p>
<p>cially the latter phase of it centering in the trial at
</p>
<p>Richmond.

<p>That Burr was himself a mapmaker is known, but
</p>
<p>PREFACE XV
</p>
<p>that maps exhibiting the geography of his Western
</p>
<p>enterprise were in existence had hardly been suspected.
</p>
<p>There are, however, three such maps in the possession
</p>
<p>of Mrs. Thomas C. Wordin. They were inherited from
</p>
<p>her grandfather, Dr. John Cummins, who hved on the
</p>
<p>Bayou Pierre in Mississippi Territory where Burr's
</p>
<p>expedition collapsed. Dr. Cummins indorsed for Burr
</p>
<p>to a considerable extent, which proved his attachment ;
</p>
<p> and no doubt when the conspirator was under trial
</p>
<p>in the Territory these tell-tale documents were turned
</p>
<p>over to one who could be trusted to secrete them. The
</p>
<p>maps are of preeminent significance, illustrating, as
</p>
<p>they undoubtedly do, the outlines of Burr's project. To
</p>
<p>distinguish, Map No. i (measuring thirty-nine inches
</p>
<p>by thirty-two) shows the lower region of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi River with Natchez, New Orleans, and the
</p>
<p>Washita lands, also New Mexico and Mexico down to
</p>
<p>[Yucatan. Map No. 2 is an admiralty chart ( twenty-three
</p>
<p>inches by nineteen) and gives with astonishing minute-
</p>
<p>ness a survey of the Gulf coast from New Orleans to
</p>
<p>Campeche. Islands, bars, and inlets are recorded, and
</p>
<p>soundings are given. The chart is beautifully executed

<p>on paper bearing the watermark of 1801. Map No. 3,

<p>which is here reproduced, measures in the original

<p>forty-five inches by nineteen. It exhibits in some of its

<p>obtained only from Spanish sources; and this opinion
</p>
<p>is reenforced by the fact that the longitude in one case
</p>
<p>is reckoned from Cadiz. On the whole, these docu-
</p>
<p>ments, the authenticity of which is indubitable, form a
</p>
<p>strong link in the chain of evidence.
</p>
<p>The correspondence of Anthony Merry, mentioned
</p>
<p>above, with whom Burr, while yet Vice-President,
</p>
<p>opened his intrigue, has been carefully examined. I had
</p>
<p>hoped also to find in the British Archives traces of
</p>
<p>Merry's correspondence with Burr in 1808, but my
</p>
<p>endeavors and the efforts of Mr. Hubert Hall of the
</p>
<p>Public Record Office were without result. Transcripts
</p>
<p>of Yrujo's correspondence with his home Government
</p>
<p>concerning Burr's disclosures to him have been de-
</p>
<p>posited by Mr. Adams in the State Department
</p>
<p>Archives at Washington, and students ought to appre-
</p>
<p>ciate such a display of good will and scholarly spirit.
</p>
<p>The reports of Merry and Yrujo reveal an astonish-
</p>
<p>ing audacity of design on the part of the conspirators.
</p>
<p>While they failed in their main purpose of obtaining
</p>
<p>needed moneys from King George and Don Carlos,
</p>
<p>they succeeded in hoodwinking both Merry and Yrujo.
</p>
<p>Here, as indicated above, there arises between Mr.
</p>
<p>Adams and myself a diversity of opinion which only
</p>
<p>serves to illustrate what different conclusions may be
</p>
<p>drawn from the same materials, taken in conjunction
</p>
<p>with additional facts. In this connection it is a pleasure
</p>
<p>to say that, while I have often had cause to disagree

<p>The Aaron Burr
</p>
<p>Conspiracy
</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>A Brief Survey of the Period
</p>
<p>THE Conspiracy of Aaron Burr was preemi-
</p>
<p>nently a revolutionary product, receiving its
</p>
<p>inspiration from that unprecedented period of
</p>
<p>upheaval which began with the Revolution of 1776, its
</p>
<p>impelling force from the character of the American
</p>
<p>pioneer, its license from the disturbed condition of
</p>
<p>affairs existing in the New World. It is therefore nec-
</p>
<p>essary, in order correctly to view the movement, to
</p>
<p>devote a few words to a general survey of contempo-
</p>
<p>raneous history, with especial regard to the West and
</p>
<p>the Spanish-American colonies.
</p>
<p>America was in the Eighteenth Century, as now,
</p>
<p>inseparably bound up with Europe, the thought and
</p>
<p>feeling of the one instantly finding response in the
</p>
<p>other; so the flame of war for larger liberty, kindled
</p>
<p>first on the shores of America, was destined to lose
</p>
<p>itself in the vastness of the general conflagration. The
</p>
<p>doctrines set forth in the Declaration of Independence

<p>struck at the root of existing European institutions
</p>
<p>2 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>among which were privileged orders  and denied the
</p>
<p>divine right of kings. The phrase that all men are
</p>
<p>created equal lent overwhelming impetus to the on-
</p>
<p>coming French Revolution, and made possible the free-
</p>
<p>dom of the wretched colonies of Spain in the Western
</p>
<p>World. The news of the rising in Europe thrilled the
</p>
<p>Thirteen Colonies which had been recently at war for
</p>
<p>their rights. The tricolor and the cockade became
</p>
<p>almost national emblems, while the mass of the people,
</p>
<p>whom the Constitution had sought in a measure to ex-
</p>
<p>clude from power, came to feel their weight in the affairs
</p>
<p>of the nation. In the Spanish- American provinces, be-
</p>
<p>cause of the strenuous measures resorted to by the au-
</p>
<p>thorities, the force of the Revolution was much abated ;
</p>
<p>but in spite of the Holy Inquisition the seditious doc-
</p>
<p>trines of the French enthusiasts were disseminated
</p>
<p>among the natives.^ Presently there were some who,
</p>
<p>brooding over the condition of their country, began to
</p>
<p>direct stirring pamphlets against the iniquities of the
</p>
<p>Spanish Government, and to plot for its disruption.^
</p>
<p>Summary and bloody were the proceedings of the au-
</p>
<p>thorities against the conspirators, but nothing could
</p>
<p>stay the spread of the maxims of liberty and equality
</p>
<p>set in motion by the great Revolution, although at the
</p>
<p>moment its crimes appalled the world.
</p>
<p>If we examine into the internal conditions of the
</p>
<p>colonial establishments of Spain we shall see that
</p>
<p>everything was ripe for disunion and rebellion. A

</p>
<p>A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE PERIOD 3
</p>
<p>writer in BeWs Messenger, an influential journal of the
</p>
<p>day, said that the Spanish Colonies supported the
</p>
<p>parent as Anchises of old was supported by his chil-
</p>
<p>dren; but that they had become tired of the weight
</p>
<p>and cared not how soon the burden was shuffled off.
</p>
<p>The condition of affairs in many parts was indeed
</p>
<p>deplorable, for the system of government which Spain
</p>
<p>bound upon her colonies was antiquated and ill ad-
</p>
<p>justed to the progress and necessities of the time.
</p>
<p>Everywhere absolutism, in Church and State, pressed
</p>
<p>the superstitious natives from one stage of degrada-
</p>
<p>tion to a lower. Almost three centuries of Span-
</p>
<p>ish rule in the Americas passed before the gross
</p>
<p>injustices in the prevailing order of things appealed to
</p>
<p>men with a force not to be repressed. Once more the
</p>
<p>masses were arrayed against privileged classes, and the
</p>
<p>fury of the Mexicans with their pikes at Guanajuato
</p>
<p>was not unlike that of the "sans-culottes" which over-
</p>
<p>turned the Bastille and inspired the Terror.
</p>
<p>The United States, through social and commercial
</p>
<p>relations, knew of the insurrections in the Spanish
</p>
<p>Americas and watched the political situation with keen
</p>
<p>and lively interest. This was but natural, for senti-
</p>
<p>mentalism and revolutionary intoxication completely
</p>
<p>possessed the American mind. It was a radical regime
</p>
<p>that bore Thomas Jefferson in triumph. Aristocracy
</p>
<p>was spurned ; the oligarchy of our early national period
</p>
<p>was rudely cast off, while in its place was installed
</p>
<p>virile, confident democracy. The sympathy of the
</p>
<p>young Republic for the French people in their struggle

</p>
<p>against the tyranny of Europe was unquestioned; in-
</p>
<p>4 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>deed, tyranny in any quarter excited them to reprobate
</p>
<p>the existence of kings.
</p>
<p>It was in the West that this madness reached its
</p>
<p>height. The course of poHtical events had told mightily
</p>
<p>in molding the character of the Westerners. Their
</p>
<p>nearest neighbors were the Spaniards in Louisiana, and
</p>
<p>these, through repressive laws and encroachments, had
</p>
<p>lost no opportunity to make life in the Mississippi
</p>
<p>Valley unendurable. The States lying to the east of
</p>
<p>the Alleghanies, the original Union, contributed much
</p>
<p>in a negative way to estrange the Western settlements
</p>
<p>by neglecting and ignoring their interests. When Spain
</p>
<p>confiscated property on the Mississippi the Westerners
</p>
<p>blazed with indignation; and yet Congress seriously
</p>
<p>considered a treaty which would have closed the Mis-
</p>
<p>sissippi to their commerce for twenty-five years. Thus
</p>
<p>outraged, the pioneers expressed their feelings through
</p>
<p>outspoken petitions to the Assembly of Virginia and to
</p>
<p>Congress. Their rights, they declared, were considered
</p>
<p>but subsidies to be traded for commercial concessions
</p>
<p>to the East; they had no market for their corn and
</p>
<p>pork ; their goods were appropriated ; the Indians wxre
</p>
<p>sent against them : they would end the tyranny by
</p>
<p>expelling the enemy from Louisiana !
</p>
<p>There followed from 1787 a decade full of confu-
</p>
<p>sion and intrigues. The most conspicuous movement
</p>
<p>was known as the Spanish Association, or Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>whose vital principle comprehended the incorporation
</p>
<p>of the West with the possessions of Spain. This, how-
</p>
<p>ever, played an insignificant part in the course of

<p>events, for the people instinctively recoiled at the
</p>
<p>A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE PERIOD 5
</p>
<p>thought of becoming subject to a nation and a civihza-
</p>
<p>.tion they loathed. In reahty it has never been shown
</p>
<p>that the movement embraced more than a few pohti-
</p>
<p>cians and pensioners of Spain, of whom James Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son was the chief, not only in point of service, but in
</p>
<p>talents. The Spanish movement can not have had,
</p>
<p>from the nature of things, roots that went deep in
</p>
<p>society  the Westerners were bound to the States by
</p>
<p>unseverable ties of blood and tradition.
</p>
<p>When France rose against England and Spain,
</p>
<p>she had the sympathies of the Americans, who were
</p>
<p>even ready to take up arms in her behalf. Indeed,
</p>
<p>so tremendous was the force brought to bear on the
</p>
<p>Government that President Washington hardly with-
</p>
<p>stood it ; even the devotion of the people to him seemed
</p>
<p>for a time irretrievably lost. At such a moment
</p>
<p>(1793) Genet, the French Minister, landed in America.
</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the tide of feeling he equipped
</p>
<p>privateers, harassed the Government and launched a
</p>
<p>project for the invasion of the Spanish Possessions
</p>
<p>from our Western States. Louisiana and the Floridas
</p>
<p>were to be taken and, perhaps, Mexico.^ During the
</p>
<p>summer Genet pushed his Louisiana expedition, which
</p>
<p>was forming in the West under the leadership of
</p>
<p>George Rogers Clark. Upon receiving notice to the
</p>
<p>effect that two hundred and fifty men were actually
</p>
<p>collected in that quarter, Thomas Jefferson, then Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of State, appealed to Governor Shelby of Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky for information. The Governor admitted the

<p>presence of French revolutionists, and that Clark had
</p>
<p>received a commission to equip an army which had for
</p>
<p>its object the clearing of the Mississippi of the Span-
</p>
<p>iards; but he said that he was powerless to interfere,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as every citizen had a right to leave the
</p>
<p>State, if he pleased, and to take with him arms and
</p>
<p>ammunition.
</p>
<p>This survey of events is necessary to us if we
</p>
<p>are rightly to interpret the Aaron Burr Conspiracy. It
</p>
<p>is only by studying the character of the people, the
</p>
<p>conditions under which they lived, and the nature of
</p>
<p>their environment that we can comprehend their feel-
</p>
<p>ings and their actions. But why should the West have
</p>
<p>been eager to wage a war against a neighboring power?
</p>
<p>Ostensibly it was a movement concerted with France
</p>
<p>against the enemies of humanity and liberty. There was
</p>
<p>still alive in the wilds of the New World something of
</p>
<p>the sentimentalism which had animated the best period
</p>
<p>of the great Revolution ; and some of it, indeed, was
</p>
<p>destined to remain in the American breast to find its
</p>
<p>fruition in a struggle for the freedom of Cuba, which
</p>
<p>had felt for four centuries the leaden weight of medise-
</p>
<p>valism. But sympathy for the oppressed is too often
</p>
<p>associated with  indeed, too often conceals  an in-
</p>
<p>stinct which rises anew with every generation of
</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxons. In the mind of the Westerners, close-
</p>
<p>linked with their hatred of Spain for her insolence on
</p>
<p>the one hand and her oppression on the other, came
</p>
<p>the longing for her fabulous riches, which they meant
</p>
<p>sooner or later to take for themselves.

</p>
<p>When the patience of the trans- Alleghany settlers
</p>
<p>A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE PERIOD 7
</p>
<p>had been well-nigh outworn, Jay's Treaty, coupled
</p>
<p>with the victories of ''Mad Anthony" Wayne over the
</p>
<p>Indians, brought relief to the Northwest, while the
</p>
<p>treaty which Pinckney negotiated at Madrid (1795)
</p>
<p>pacified the South and West. Spain at last recognized
</p>
<p>the claim of the United States to the free navigation of
</p>
<p>the Mississippi and granted under certain conditions
</p>
<p>the right of depositing goods in New Orleans. This
</p>
<p>dropping of the bars to commercial expansion proved
</p>
<p>a great stimulus to emigration; and by the end
</p>
<p>of the century the Westerners, numbering 400,000
</p>
<p>souls, were scattered along the Great Lakes, were
</p>
<p>gazing across the Mississippi, and were crowding the
</p>
<p>boundary lines of the Floridas. Indeed, no longer were
</p>
<p>boundaries sufficient to stay their progress  many
</p>
<p>pushed into Missouri and Louisiana ; but for the present
</p>
<p>the goal toward which all eyes were turned was the
</p>
<p>possession of New Orleans and the Mississippi.
</p>
<p>"At the beginning of the nineteenth century," says
</p>
<p>Roosevelt,^ '*the settlers on the Western waters recognized
</p>
<p>in Spain their natural enemy, because she was the power
</p>
<p>which held the South and the west bank of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi. They would have transferred their hostility to
</p>
<p>any other power which fell heir to her possessions, for
</p>
<p>these possessions they were bound one day to make
</p>
<p>their own."
</p>
<p>Such an opinion was shared in Europe. The French
</p>
<p>Ambassador, writing to his home Government from
</p>
<p>Madrid, said:^

<p>8 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>''The Cabinet of Madrid thinks it has the greatest in-
</p>
<p>terests not to open the Mississippi to the Americans, and
</p>
<p>to disgust them from making estabHshments on that river,
</p>
<p>as they would not delay to possess themselves of the
</p>
<p>commerce of New Orleans and Mexico, whatever impedi-
</p>
<p>ments should be opposed to their progress, and that they
</p>
<p>would become neighbors the more dangerous to Spain 
</p>
<p>as, even in their present weakness, they conceive vast
</p>
<p>projects for the conquest of the western shore of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi."
</p>
<p>With the opening of the Nineteenth Century the
</p>
<p>grievances against Spain took a new form. Although
</p>
<p>the Mississippi had been thrown open to the commerce
</p>
<p>of the Americans they were forbidden to enter the
</p>
<p>Spanish domain on pain of arrest and imprisonment,
</p>
<p>or even death. The traders among the Indians were
</p>
<p>apprehended, their goods confiscated, and border
</p>
<p>troubles  for example the Kemper brothers episode in
</p>

<p>against the arrogant foreigners. The Americans looked

<p>wken he declared that : *'The whole country was in
</p>
<p>commotion and, at the nod of the Government, would
</p>
<p>have fallen on Baton Rouge and New Orleans, and
</p>
<p>punished the treachery of the perfidious Government." ^
</p>
<p>In many quarters it was openly advocated that the
</p>
<p>West should appeal to arms. "Coriolanus" said in the
</p>
<p>Alorniiig Chronicle, December 27, 1802 : "Kentucky
</p>
<p>has the advantage of invasion; and she no doubt will
</p>
<p>use it, if unsupported by the Union; she moves alone
</p>
<p>to the combat; she is situated on the waters rapidly
</p>
<p>descending to the point of attack ; she will overwhelm
</p>
<p>Orleans and West Florida with promptitude and
</p>
<p>ease."^
</p>
<p>Amidst this general clamor came the startling
</p>
<p>report of the transfer of Louisiana to Napoleon. The
</p>
<p>South joined the West in declaring that France should
</p>
<p>not be allowed to establish herself in her old possession.
</p>
<p>Nor was Jefferson so deaf as to mistake the ring of
</p>
<p>earnestness in the voice of his constituency  his strong-
</p>
<p>hold was in the South and West. He wrote in his
</p>
<p>message to Congress, October 17, 1803: "Previously,
</p>
<p>however, to this period we have not been unaware of
</p>
<p>the danger to which our peace would be perpetually
</p>
<p>exposed, whilst so important a key to the command of
</p>
<p>the western country remained under foreign power."
</p>
<p>At the crisis, he said that if France persisted in her
</p>
<p>course to reoccupy Louisiana the United States would,
</p>
<p>of necessity, be forced to marry the army and navy of
</p>
<p>England. He wished not for war; yet he saw that it

<p>was unavoidable if Louisiana was not secured to the
</p>
<p>Union, so he sought to purchase the coveted land.
</p>
<p>In 1762 France ceded to Spain a region of unknown
</p>
<p>extent lying in the main to the west of the Mississippi ;
</p>
<p>this territory was known as Louisiana, having been
</p>
<p>named in honor of the great Louis. But now that
</p>
<p>France again led the nations and was dominated by
</p>
<p>such a man as Bonaparte the retrocession was sought,
</p>
<p>and on October i, 1800, with the secret treaty of San
</p>
<p>Ildefonso the act was concluded. Without entering into
</p>
<p>details, it is enough to state that the rupture of the
</p>
<p>Peace of Amiens, with its immediate consequences,
</p>
<p>caused Napoleon to meet the United States half way 
</p>
<p>and Louisiana was sold.
</p>
<p>Hardly had the report of its acquisition become
</p>
<p>public when the question as to limits arose. Indeed,
</p>
<p>the United States commissioners, Monroe and Living-
</p>
<p>ston, were engaged over this before the papers were
</p>
<p>signed. France held that the United States was en-
</p>
<p>titled only to the land known as Louisiana, which was
</p>
<p>transferred to Spain ini762andwhich"was retroceded to
</p>
<p>France by Spain in the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800.
</p>
<p>The United States was entitled to so much, but what
</p>
<p>were the boundaries ? Flow far did Louisiana extend to
</p>
<p>the east? To the Iberville or to the Perdido? And
</p>
<p>was the western limit marked by the Arroyo Hondo,
</p>
<p>the Sabine, or the Rio Grande?
</p>
<p>The question of limits, however, did not at first
</p>
<p>disturb the minds of the Westerners. The cession
</p>
<p>created great rejoicing throughout the region directly

<p>while governors thought it of enough importance to
</p>
<p>mention in their messages. Governor Greenup told in
</p>
<p>grandiloquent words what it meant for Kentucky and
</p>
<p>for the West, closing his remarks with a peroration on
</p>
<p>America as the home of freedom/ Quite different was
</p>
<p>the attitude of New England, where the purchase was
</p>
<p>held up to the grossest ridicule. To the men who
</p>
<p>opened the way for the march of empire it meant
</p>
<p>everything. No longer would their flatboats be levied
</p>
<p>upon by Spain for floating on the Father of Waters ; no
</p>
<p>longer would they be barred from the markets because
</p>
<p>of excessive duties; no longer would their material
</p>
<p>growth be hampered by a foreign power;  there were
</p>
<p>new regions to occupy, richer lands to develop and un-
</p>
<p>bounded freedom of action! Now indeed the West-
</p>
<p>erners rejoiced in the strong arm of the Government.
</p>
<p>They had more than they had dared to expect, and their
</p>
<p>enthusiasm for Jefferson and the national Government,
</p>
<p>to whom all was attributed, was unlimited.
</p>
<p>The acquisition of Louisiana settled finally the
</p>
<p>question of the navigation of the Mississippi; but the
</p>
<p>boundary dispute, complicated by the "French Spolia-

<p>dations on American commerce, promised no solution
</p>
<p>short of the sword. In the West, in truth, the sword
</p>
<p>was ready at any moment to leap from the scabbard.

<p>If the backwoodsman desired to move into new lands in

<p>view  to strike a blow at Spain. The primary purpose
</p>
<p>of any expedition was to corrupt his Majesty's alhes,the
</p>
<p>Indians, or to study the geography for inihtary pur-
</p>
<p>poses. NemecioSalcedo, Captain-General of the Internal
</p>
<p>Provinces of Mexico, went to such an extreme that he
</p>
<p>complained to the Viceroy, in October, 1805, of the
</p>
<p>Lewis and Clark Expedition, saying that it went osten-
</p>
<p>sibly to discover the source of the Missouri, but really
</p>
<p>to estrange the Indians.^ The Viceroy of Mexico sent
</p>
<p>reinforcements to the Sabine River to protect the fron-
</p>
<p>tier, and agents among the natives of Texas. Presents
</p>
<p>were distributed among them, for, as the Spaniards
</p>
<p>wrote. Dr. Sibley, the Indian agent of the Americans,
</p>
<p>had tried to seduce them from their allegiance. Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son, also in expectation of war, instructed Sibley to
</p>
<p>spare no means to convince the Red Men "of the justice
</p>
<p>and liberality we are determined to use towards them,
</p>
<p>and to attach them to us indissolubly." ^
</p>
<p>Beside the bitter hatred of Spain there had sprung
</p>
<p>into vigorous life in the West a national consciousness,
</p>
<p>a national mind, which resented the insults of the
</p>
<p>powers and which was destined to preserve the Union
</p>
<p>in the second war with Great Britain. Indeed, in a
</p>
<p>sense, love for the Constitution meant detestation of

<p>Spain. The conflict with the wilderness and its inhabi-

<p>vSpanish tyranny and had, under the stimulus of their
</p>
<p>predilections, converted them unwittingly into revolu-
</p>
<p>tionists ; and thus for years the West harbored the most
</p>
<p>devoted adherents of the Constitution and the most
</p>
<p>unscrupulous filibusters. They had a contempt for
</p>
<p>Spanish institutions, civil and religious, and were filled
</p>
<p>with ''painful solicitude for the unfortunate millions
</p>
<p>she held in bondage." They indulged, said Foote in
</p>
<p>his History of Texas, "a. jealousy active and unre-
</p>
<p>mitting towards the Spanish Government and people
</p>
<p>on account of the power which they possessed of dis-
</p>
<p>turbing the peace and retarding the growth of the
</p>
<p>United States." To contempt and jealousy were
</p>
<p>added the sense of injustice done us in the Napo-
</p>
<p>leonic wars and the question of the settlement of
</p>
<p>boundaries. Most Westerners thought West Florida
</p>
<p>and Texas ours by right of purchase and were eager
</p>
<p>to seize them. The Bishop of Nueva Leon, who visited

<p>Natchitoches in January, 1805, wrote ^ to Viceroy Itur-

<p>many, too, who endorsed what Jefferson suggested in a

<p>letter to A. Stewart in 1785 concerning the disposition
</p>
<p>of the Spanish possessions, that it was best for the

<p>interests of the great continent not to press too soon

<p>herent dread of the approach of the Americans, who
</p>
<p>were looked upon as being by blood and tradition law-
</p>
<p>less terrorists and revolutionists. Nor has the history
</p>
<p>of Spain in America during the Nineteenth Century
</p>
<p>tended, in their view, to disprove the correctness of the
</p>
<p>belief. One of the reasons which brought Spain to
</p>
<p>consent to the transfer of Louisiana to France was the
</p>
<p>hope that it would be made a buffer between the Ameri-
</p>
<p>can and her own possessions. But its acquisition by the
</p>
<p>United States reopened the fears and difficulties of her
</p>
<p>neighbor. Louisiana became henceforth, as de Onis,
</p>
<p>the noted minister to this country, wrote,^ a gateway
</p>
<p>for adventurers into Mexico.
</p>
<p>On the Continent, so far as our study is concerned,
</p>
<p>the supremacy of French influence in the determinations
</p>
<p>of the Spanish Court was of paramount importance.
</p>
<p>It made possible the peaceful acquisition of Louisiana
</p>
<p>and restrained the United States from going to war
</p>
<p>with Spain during the years immediately succeeding;
</p>
<p>for war with Spain meant war with France also. But

<p>for this, Mexico and other Spanish-American colonies

<p>would have been earlier revolutionized. Napoleon

<p>desired to bring into his world-wide empire these

<p>rier between the two disputants. The wars that raged

<p>and her memory of the War of the Revolution that

<p>she disregarded at will our interests and insulted when-

<p>and in accomplishing this she became the prey of both

<p>A 11 iTHE time when he embarked in his conspir-
</p>
<p>/\ acy Aaron Burr was forty-nine years of age. He
</p>
<p>./. JL. owned a distinguished ancestry ; Jonathan
</p>
<p>Edwards, the foremost theologian of America, was
</p>
<p>his grandfather on his mother's side, while the Burrs
</p>
<p>were of noble German blood, Aaron's father being a
</p>
<p>noted divine and president of Princeton College. The
</p>
<p>misfortunes of Burr began early; his parents died,
</p>
<p>leaving him and an only sister at a tender age to the
</p>
<p>care of relatives. He was carefully prepared for col-
</p>
<p>lege and at sixteen was graduated with distinction
</p>
<p>from Princeton. He was destined for the ministry, but
</p>
<p>a few months' study of theology under Dr. Bellamy
</p>
<p>seems to have confirmed him in skepticism. He deter-
</p>
<p>mined to take up the law, and began its study under
</p>
<p>Tappan Reeve, his brother-in-law. But the news of
</p>
<p>the battle of Lexington startled him from this for the
</p>
<p>time being. Hurrying to Boston Burr took his place
</p>
<p>in the ranks, and later joined Arnold's expedition to
</p>
<p>Quebec, nothing deterred by the perils of snow and ice
</p>
<p>and the pleadings of his relatives. He won distinction
</p>
<p>in the campaign and had the melancholy honor of bear-
</p>
<p>ing away the dead body of General Montgomery from
</p>
<p>before the snowbound blockhouse whence recoiled the
</p>
<p>last serious assault on the capital of Canada. Burr's

<p>withal his knowledge of military science recommended
</p>
<p>him to his superiors. From an aide-de-camp to General
</p>
<p>Putnam he was soon elevated to the command of a
</p>
<p>regiment, acquitting himself notably while in charge of
</p>
<p>the Westchester lines above New York City.
</p>
<p>After four years of unremitting service, Burr re-
</p>
<p>signed from the army and at once bent his energies
</p>
<p>to the law, and within a short space was admitted to
</p>
<p>practice. He opened an office in Albany and was soon
</p>
<p>after married to Theodosia Prevost, an attractive and
</p>
<p>intellectual widow. To them was born a daughter,
</p>
<p>Theodosia, who w^as to play a brilliant and tragic role.
</p>
<p>Burr resided at Albany until the British were with-
</p>
<p>drawn from New York, when he moved thither and
</p>
<p>began the practice of his profession in earnest, mount-
</p>
<p>ing rapidly in the esteem of the public and dividing
</p>
<p>honors w^ith Alexander Hamilton.
</p>
<p>Burr's entry into politics seems to have been more
</p>
<p>by accident than design. In the beginning he steered
</p>
<p>clear of an alliance with either of the three great fami-
</p>
<p>lies  the Clintons, Livingstons, and Schuylers  creat-
</p>
<p>ing for himself an independent party, the nucleus of
</p>
<p>which was a group of enthusiastic young men whom
</p>
<p>Hamilton denominated Burr's myrmidons. As yet
</p>
<p>things went smoothly for Burr who was, in 1789, after
</p>
<p>having opposed the reelection of George Clinton to the
</p>
<p>governorship, appointed by him Attorney-General of
</p>
<p>the State. In this capacity he won recognition both as
</p>
<p>an orator and as an administrator. Two years later, to
</p>
<p>his surprise, so far as we know, he was elected to the

<p>Schuyler, Hamilton's father-in-law. This was the
</p>
<p>beginning of the feud which closed with the dark,
</p>
<p>lamentable tragedy of Weehawken  the duel in which
</p>
<p>Hamilton was slain.
</p>
<p>The career of Burr in the Senate, where he espoused
</p>
<p>the Republican cause, Avas eminently honorable. He at
</p>
<p>once strode toward the leadership of the party, and in
</p>
<p>the Presidential election of 1796 received thirty elec-
</p>
<p>toral votes. At the end of his term of office, retired as
</p>
<p>Senator, he entered upon the maelstrom of New York
</p>
<p>politics. New York was in the election of 1800, as it
</p>
<p>has been so often since, the pivotal State, the determin-
</p>
<p>ing factor in the national election. Through Burr's
</p>
<p>agency the Clintons and Livingstons were united, the
</p>
<p>schisms in the ranks of the opposition were widened,
</p>
<p>and the commonwealth was swept by the Republican
</p>
<p>electors. Burr was rightly credited with the victory,
</p>
<p>and was obviously the logical candidate for the Vice-
</p>
<p>Presidency, for which place he was nominated by the
</p>
<p>Congressional caucus which named Jefferson for the
</p>
<p>highest honor.
</p>
<p>When the votes of the Electoral College were polled
</p>
<p>it was found that Jefferson and Burr had each seventy-
</p>
<p>three; John Adams sixty-five; Pinckney sixty- four;
</p>
<p>Jay one. There being a tie, the election was accord-
</p>
<p>ingly thrown into the House of Representatives, where
</p>
<p>it resolved itself into a struggle between the Federal-
</p>
<p>ists and the Republicans. After weary days of ballot-
</p>
<p>ing and much bitterness Jefferson was made President,
</p>
<p>Burr becoming Vice-President. Now indeed storms

<p>tons and Livingstons as an interloper. The party once
</p>
<p>victorious, he was discovered to be in the path of several
</p>
<p>aspiring gentlemen, who left no means untouched for
</p>
<p>his undoing. Attacked viciously by Cheetham, the
</p>
<p>scurrilous editor of the American Citizen, the organ of
</p>
<p>De Witt Clinton, he became also an object of suspicion
</p>
<p>and envy in the eyes of Jefferson and the Virginia
</p>
<p>political clique. Some of his assailants were only too
</p>
<p>glad to drag from the cesspool of political scandals any
</p>
<p>fragment which might be available in besmirching his
</p>
<p>character. He was accused of this and that, through all

<p>Alexander Hamilton, who had pursued him with

<p>part he had played in the election. If anything was now

<p>lacking to make Burr's isolation complete it was his
</p>
<p>stepping down from the chair of the Senate. Cast out by
</p>
<p>the Republicans, he was scorned and persecuted by the
</p>
<p>Federalists. As a party leader he was dead. Brilliant,
</p>
<p>ambitious, he must now have been in a state of mind
</p>
<p>bordering on despair, had he been addicted to gloom
</p>
<p>and melancholy. But it is not shown that Burr ever

<p>lamented or grieved over the course of things, how-
</p>
<p>ever severely and painfully it pressed upon him. He

<p>leader as they had been under the flush of his startHng
</p>
<p>successes. Driven from power in the States, he turned
</p>
<p>with enthusiasm to a plan he had early formed of revo-
</p>
<p>lutionizing the Spanish colonies.^ Indeed, before his
</p>
<p>term of office had expired, he was busy evolving ways
</p>
<p>and means which were to contribute to its success. As
</p>
<p>early as August 6, 1804, he had begun through an
</p>
<p>intermediary his intrigue with Anthony Merry, British
</p>
<p>Minister to the United States.^
</p>
<p>A few days after the oath of office had been admin-
</p>
<p>istered to his successor, George Clinton, Burr, still ani-
</p>
<p>mated with the applause his last words in the Senate
</p>
<p>had occasioned, left Washington on a tour of the West
</p>
<p> a preliminary to the inauguration of his project. He
</p>
<p>reached Philadelphia March 21, 1805, where he planned
</p>
<p>to spend ten days before continuing his journey. There
</p>
<p>he met Merry, to whom he now laid open his deceptive
</p>
<p>project, which he hoped would wring from the British
</p>
<p>treasury a sum of money commensurate with his needs.
</p>
<p>Mr. Merry, in a cipher letter of March 29th, gave Lord
</p>
<p>Harrowby the details :' 
</p>
<p>''Notwithstanding the known profligacy of Mr. Burr's

<p>BURR'S TOUR OF THE WEST 21
</p>
<p>mentioned to me that the inhabitants of Louisiana seem
</p>
<p>determined to render themselves independent of the
</p>
<p>United States and that the execution of their design is
</p>
<p>only delayed by the difficulty of obtaining previously an
</p>
<p>assurance of protection and assistance from some foreign
</p>
<p>power and of concerting and connecting their independ-
</p>
<p>ence with that of the inhabitants of the Western parts
</p>
<p>of the United States, who must always have a command
</p>
<p>over them by the rivers which communicate with the
</p>
<p>Mississippi. It is clear that Mr. Burr (although he has
</p>
<p>not as yet confided to me the exact nature and extent of
</p>
<p>his plan) means to endeavor to be the instrument for
</p>
<p>effecting such a connection. He has told me that the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of Louisiana, notwithstanding that they are
</p>
<p>almost all of French or Spanish origin, as well as those
</p>
<p>of the Western part of the United States, would, for
</p>
<p>many obvious reasons, prefer having the protection and
</p>
<p>assistance of Great Britain to the support of France ; but
</p>
<p>that if his Majesty's government should not think proper
</p>
<p>to listen to his overture, application will be made to that
</p>
<p>of France, who will, he had reason to know, be eager to
</p>
<p>attend to it in the most effectual manner, observing that
</p>
<p>peace in Europe would accelerate the event in question
</p>
<p>by affording to the French more easy means of com-
</p>
<p>munication with the continent of America, though, even
</p>
<p>while at war with England, they might always find those
</p>
<p>of sending the small force that would be required for
</p>
<p>the purpose in question. He pointed out the great com-
</p>
<p>mercial advantage which his Majesty's dominions in
</p>
<p>general would derive from furnishing almost exclusively
</p>
<p>(as they might through Canada and New Orleans) the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of so extensive a territory."
</p>
<p>A masterly argument and impressively put. It was
</p>
<p>a luring bait, and Merry took it at once for what it

</p>
<p>seemed  forwarding it to his Government with as
</p>
<p>much approbation as he dared and with as much expedi-
</p>
<p>tion as he could command. If the commercial classes
</p>
<p>of England were determined to annihilate American
</p>
<p>22 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>trade, if King George was set upon insulting the
</p>
<p>young nation as part of his daily routine, the idea of
</p>
<p>dividing the house against itself seemed to Merry not
</p>
<p>only inviting, but most wise and diplomatic. And
</p>
<p>furthermore, should England reject the offer, France
</p>
<p>might seize the occasion to deal the commercial and
</p>
<p>political interests of her enemy a telling blow. The
</p>
<p>proposition was inviting. Thus far the ex-Vice-Presi-
</p>
<p>dent had dealt only in generalities  he had discussed
</p>
<p>what was the common talk of the day concerning the
</p>
<p>infidelity of Louisiana and its determination to revolt.
</p>
<p>When pressed for something more tangible. Burr
</p>
<p>simply made excuses, giving out only as much as he
</p>
<p>deemed necessary to secure ''the protection and assur-
</p>
<p>ance required to accomplish the object." Merry con-
</p>
<p>tinued :
</p>
<p>"Mr. Burr observed that it would be too dangerous
</p>
<p>and even premature to disclose to me at present the full
</p>
<p>extent and detail of the plan he had formed ; but that he
</p>
<p>was at the same time aware of the necessity of making
</p>
<p>the most ample and unreserved communication to his
</p>
<p>Majesty's government, in order that they might be fully
</p>
<p>satisfied, as well of the good faith with which he means
</p>
<p>to act, as of the practicability and utility to them of the
</p>
<p>undertaking which he had in view and that he would
</p>
<p>therefore send a confidential person to England to make
</p>
<p>those communications as soon as he should have received
</p>
<p>through me, the necessary assurance of their being
</p>
<p>disposed to grant the protection and assurance required
</p>
<p>to accomplish the object."

</p>
<p>to Merry which he knew had not the shght-est chance
</p>
<p>of realization, did not appear at the moment, but could
</p>
<p>not have been more boldly proclaimed than in his
</p>
<p>statement of the ''protection and assurance required" :
</p>
<p>"In regard to the military aid, he said, two or three
</p>
<p>frigates and the same number of smaller vessels to be
</p>
<p>stationed at the mouth of the Mississippi to prevent its
</p>
<p>being blockaded by such force as the United States
</p>
<p>could send, and to keep open the communications with
</p>
<p>the sea would be the whole that would be wanted ; and
</p>
<p>in respect to money the loan of about one hundred thou-
</p>
<p>sand pounds would, he conceived, be sufficient for the
</p>
<p>immediate purposes of the enterprise, although it was
</p>
<p>impossible for him to speak at present with accuracy as
</p>
<p>to this matter. On the latter allegation he observed that
</p>
<p>any suspicion of his Majesty's government being con-
</p>
<p>cerned in the transaction, till after their independence
</p>
<p>should have been declared, which would arise if remit-
</p>
<p>tances were made to this country or if bills were drawn
</p>
<p>from hence, might be avoided by the appropriation to this
</p>
<p>object of a proportion of the two hundred thousand
</p>
<p>pounds which the United States have to pay to his Maj-
</p>
<p>esty next July, and part of which sum he would devise
</p>
<p>the means to get into his possession without its destina-
</p>
<p>tion being either known or suspected."
</p>
<p>Already the matter of money was worrying Burr
</p>
<p>and his chief associates. This most necessary article
</p>
<p>in the inauguration of any project was their first con-
</p>
<p>sideration, and, that it might be obtained, no device
</p>
<p>however questionable or nefarious was to be ignored
</p>
<p>if success were promised  the end would justify the
</p>
<p>means. The matter of the two or three frigates at the
</p>
<p>mouth of the Mississippi was as nothing in the scales

<p>with a hundred thousand pounds, which were conceived
</p>
<p>24 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>to be sufficient for the ''immediate purposes of the
</p>
<p>enterprise."
</p>
<p>After the interview with Merry, Burr quickly made
</p>
<p>his preparations for his journey over the mountains to
</p>
<p>Pittsburg. He advised his daughter to address him for
</p>
<p>the time being at Cincinnati, in care of John Smith,
</p>
<p>Senator from Ohio, adding that the object of his
</p>
<p>journey, "not mere curiosity or pour passer le temps,''
</p>
<p>might take him to New Orleans and perhaps farther. It
</p>
<p>is quite probable that Burr planned a continuation of
</p>
<p>his voyage of discovery to Mexico. Certain it is that
</p>
<p>he alarmed CasaYrujo  the Spanish Minister who was
</p>
<p>proving such a plague to Jefferson  before leaving
</p>
<p>Washington by sending twice to him for a passport to
</p>
<p>Mexico, ''under the pretext that the death of General
</p>
<p>Hamilton (whom he killed out of spite) would not
</p>
<p>permit his remaining in the United States." Yrujo
</p>
<p>knew of Burr's interviews with Merry, and therefore
</p>
<p>thought the object of Burr's visit most suspicious  in
</p>
<p>a word, he believed him the spy of England. He
</p>
<p>reported that Burr had taken with him mathematical
</p>
<p>instruments for the purpose of making plans, and that
</p>
<p>the officials of the Floridas had been warned against
</p>
<p>his manoeuvres.^ But Yrujo had not penetrated Burr's
</p>
<p>designs; little dreamed that his purpose was to place
</p>
<p>himself in touch with the revolutionists of Mexico, who
</p>
<p>were so shortly to smite the power of Spain.
</p>
<p>On April 29, 1805, Burr reached Pittsburg on the
</p>
<p>Ohio, where General James Wilkinson, who had just
</p>
<p>been appointed Governor of the newly organized Terri-

<p>tory of Louisiana, was to have joined him. But Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son had been delayed ; so, leaving a letter for him, Burr
</p>
<p>embarked upon the Ohio in an ark which he had had
</p>
<p>specially prepared for him. In due time he reached
</p>
<p>Marietta, a hamlet of eighty houses, where he parted
</p>
<p>company with Mathew Lyon, member of Congress
</p>
<p>from Tennessee, whom he had overtaken en route and
</p>
<p>with whom it seems the matter of Burr's return to Con-
</p>
<p>gress from that State was discussed. Putting off the
</p>
<p>next day he passed Parkersburg, and two miles below
</p>
<p>arrived at Blennerhassett's Island, which has become
</p>
<p>famous through its connection with the conspiracy. Its
</p>
<p>three hundred acres have been much reduced by the
</p>
<p>encroachment of the river, but the narrowing shores,
</p>
<p>where Harman Blennerhassett, an Irish gentleman,
</p>
<p>had planted fields of hemp and had erected palatial
</p>
<p>buildings, are still haunted with the memory of a
</p>
<p>tragedy. The master was absent, but Mrs. Blenner-
</p>
<p>hassett invited the ex-Vice-President to dinner  and
</p>
<p>this was the beginning of a connection which was to
</p>
<p>link forever the names of Burr and Blennerhassett.
</p>
<p>On the eleventh of May Burr reached Cincinnati,
</p>
<p>then a town of fifteen hundred inhabitants, where
</p>
<p>he became the guest of Senator John Smith, who was -4
</p>
<p>also a storekeeper and army contractor. There he
</p>
<p>met Jonathan Dayton, a friend from Revolutionary
</p>
<p>times, whose term as Senator from New Jersey had
</p>
<p>just expired. Burr spent a day in the company of
</p>
<p>Smith and Dayton, who were allied with him in the
</p>
<p>formulation of plans for the project. Hurrying down
</p>
<p>the river he next stopped at Louisville, whence he took

<p>horse to Frankfort, which place was reached May 20th.
</p>
<p>Passing through Lexington, the 29th found him at
</p>
<p>Nashville, where he was four days the guest of Andrew
</p>
<p>Jackson and the recipient of unusual attentions. He
</p>
<p>was no longer the despised murderer of Hamilton, but
</p>
<p>the triumphant duelist; no longer the insidious, un-
</p>
<p>scrupulous intriguer, but the general who had led the
</p>
<p>cohorts of Democracy to victory; and, finally, he was
</p>
<p>accepted as the predestined leader who was to scourge
</p>
<p>the Spaniards from America. This was, after all, the
</p>
<p>mission of his life. Such was Burr's announcement,
</p>
<p>and the news spread as fast as such welcome tidings
</p>
<p>might travel. To the Tennesseeans and the frontiers-
</p>
<p>men in general it was a battle-call they were only too
</p>
<p>eager to answer; and among the first to respond was
</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson, major-general of the Tennessee
</p>
<p>militia.
</p>
<p>On June 3d Burr was provided by his host with an
</p>
<p>open boat, in which he floated to the mouth of the"
</p>
<p>Cumberland River, a distance of two hundred and
</p>
<p>thirty miles, where his ark, which had come down the
</p>
<p>Ohio, was in waiting. The next stop was made sixteen
</p>
<p>miles down the Ohio at Fort Massac  a prominent
</p>
<p>frontier post on the north bank of the river not many
</p>
<p>miles from its juncture with the Mississippi  where
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson had arrived, having descended the
</p>
<p>river from Pittsburg in the wake of Burr. The General
</p>
<p>had halted also in Cincinnati, keeping company with
</p>
<p>Smith and Dayton, who were represented as busy with
</p>
<p>a scheme to dig a canal around the falls of the Ohio.

</p>
<p>He found time, however, to write to John Adair, an
</p>
<p>BURR'S TOUR OF THE WEST 27
</p>
<p>influential Kentuckian soon to succeed John Brecken-
</p>
<p>ridge in the Senate: "I was to have introduced my
</p>
<p>friend Burr to you ; but in this I failed by accident.
</p>
<p>He understands your merits, and reckons on you. Pre-
</p>
<p>pare to visit me, and I will tell you all. We must have
</p>
<p>a peep at the unknown world beyond me." This letter
</p>
<p>perhaps affords a clue to the topic discussed by the
</p>
<p>General and his friends during the four days spent at
</p>
<p>Massac. No doubt the whole situation was canvassed :
</p>
<p>the probability of war with Spain ; the ease with which
</p>
<p>the Floridas might be overrun ; the matter of the equip-
</p>
<p>ping of an army which should sail for Vera Cruz to
</p>
<p>light the torch of insurrection in Mexico. Wilkinson
</p>
<p>afterward averred that the subjects of their conferences
</p>
<p>were legitimate. Whatever they were, the two old
</p>
<p>army friends, who had stood side by side under the
</p>
<p>walls of Quebec, parted with high hopes, Wilkinson
</p>
<p>making his way slowly to St. Louis, while Burr set out
</p>
<p>in a barge fitted up by the general with sails and colors,
</p>
<p>and manned by ten soldiers and a sergeant. In his
</p>
<p>pocket was a letter to Daniel Clark, a prominent mer-
</p>
<p>chant and influential citizen of New Orleans :
</p>
<p>"This will be delivered to you by Colonel Burr,"
</p>
<p>began the general's introductory note,^ ''whose worth you
</p>
<p>know well how to estimate. If the persecutions of a
</p>
<p>great and honorable man, can give title to generous atten-
</p>
<p>tions, he has claims to all your civilities, and all your
</p>
<p>services. You cannot oblige me more than by such con-
</p>
<p>duct ; and I pledge my life to you, it will not be misap-
</p>
<p>plied. To him I refer you for many things improper to

</p>
<p>2 8 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>While Burr, thus equipped, passed on toward New
</p>
<p>Orleans, Wilkinson approached Majors Bruff and Hunt
</p>
<p>of the garrison of St. Louis, Timothy Kibby, John
</p>
<p>McKee, and others with propositions varying from the
</p>
<p>conquest of Mexico to the establishment of a military
</p>
<p>empire in Louisiana as a consequence of anarchy in the
</p>
<p>Eastern States, growing out of the rule of Democracy.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson had already begun sowing the seeds which
</p>
<p>were to prove the destruction of Burr. On June 24th
</p>
<p>instructions were written for Lieutenant Pike, who
</p>
<p>went, according to Kibby and Adair, to explore the
</p>
<p>way to Santa Fe and the mines of Mexico.
</p>
<p>On June 25, 1805, Burr landed at New Orleans. The
</p>
<p>Orleans Gazette chronicled at the time : "Colonel Aaron
</p>
<p>Burr, late Vice-President of the United States, arrived
</p>
<p>here on Wednesday last in a boat displaying the Ameri-
</p>
<p>can ensign, and rowed by a detachment of soldiers.
</p>
<p>We understand he purposes returning to Kentucky in
</p>
<p>ten or twelve days." Burr was much pleased with the
</p>
<p>city, and wrote Theodosia that he should certainly
</p>
<p>settle there were it not for herself and her boy, who
</p>
<p>controlled his fate. New Orleans was a place of no
</p>
<p>mean importance; during the course of a year three
</p>
<p>hundred sea-going vessels and six thousand river flat-
</p>
<p>boats arrived at its levees, and nine thousand people
</p>
<p>busied themselves within its limits. The letter to Clark
</p>
<p>was presented, and at an early date he gave a dinner
</p>
<p>in Burr's honor, which was attended by the best element
</p>
<p>in the city. Other fetes followed, and Burr was every-

</p>
<p>where received with the utmost cordiality.
</p>
<p>BURR'S TOUR OF THE WEST 29
</p>
<p>The society most frequented by Burr has been, and
</p>
<p>in all probability will remain, a source of dispute.^
</p>
<p>There is no conclusive evidence to show that Burr re-
</p>
<p>stricted his confidences while in New Orleans to any
</p>
<p>individual or group of individuals. It appears from
</p>
<p>the light we have that Burr's purpose was to observe
</p>
<p>the drift of public opinion; to engage the warlike and
</p>
<p>the adventurous in his filibustering enterprise against
</p>
<p>the Spanish possessions. In this he was most success-
</p>
<p>ful; the Mexican Association, formed for the avowed
</p>
<p>purpose of collecting Mexican data which would be
</p>
<p>useful for the United States in case of war with
</p>
<p>Spain, was enlisted in his cause. Tw^o of the most
</p>
<p>influential members of the Association were John Wat-
</p>
<p>kins, Mayor of New Orleans, and James Workman,
</p>
<p>judge of the county court. The former related to
</p>
<p>W. C. C. Claiborne, Governor of the Territory of
</p>
<p>^Henry Adams says that Burr was "entertained by the
</p>
<p>enemies of Governor Claiborne and of the Spaniards" {History
</p>
<p>of the United States, iii., 223) ; that Wilkinson told the story, on
</p>
<p>the evidence of Lieutenant Spence, that "Burr on his arrival in
</p>
<p>Louisiana became acquainted with the so-called Mexican Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation  a body of some three hundred men, leagued together
</p>
<p>for the emancipation of Mexico from the Spanish rule, . . .
</p>
<p>and under his influence the scheme of disunion was made a part

</p>
<p>more than established the correctness of the Proofs,
</p>
<p>which exposed Wilkinson's corrupt dealings with the

<p>Spaniards; and if Clark never fully divulged his knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of Burr's project, he betrayed the secret of it when
</p>
<p>he declared on the floor of Congress, at the moment
</p>
<p>when expectation was at its highest tension, that if
</p>
<p>treason were contemplated no Louisianian would be
</p>
<p>found concerned in it ! Clark himself entertained revo-
</p>
<p>lutionary ideas, but they did not involve the sundering
</p>
<p>of the States. John Graham, Secretary of the Territory
</p>
<p>of Orleans, said that Clark had given him some papers
</p>
<p>which told, among other things, of the strength of the
</p>
<p>Mexican forces and garrisoned towns between Vera
</p>
<p>Cruz and the City of Mexico, and of the naval strength
</p>
<p>of Vera Cruz. It was Clark's opinion that Mexico
</p>
<p>could be easily invaded, but he would have nothing to
</p>
<p>do with such an undertaking if headed by the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment. Permission was all that was wanted  an empire
</p>
<p>could then be established.' This information had been

<p>wont to recite to Government the news of Europe and

<p>America. But an end came to this when the Spaniards
</p>
<p>learned that he had been chosen a Delegate to Congress.'
</p>
<p>Burr no doubt profited by what Clark had learned of the
</p>
<p>conditions of society in Mexico, and the merchant was
</p>
<p>observer enough to note that a revolution was imminent.
</p>
<p>That he agreed to join with Burr there is little doubt;
</p>
<p>but he, like many others, wished to see the movement
</p>
<p>triumphant before sharing its fortunes. Certain it is
</p>
<p>Clark never set out to play a heavy part in the plot,
</p>
<p>which, as he understood it, was wholly against Mexico.

<p>It was a matter for jest with him when he heard on

<p>the streets of New Orleans the extravagant designs
</p>
<p>attributed to his new acquaintance, whose address even

<p>was unknown to him. September 7th, a few weeks
</p>
<p>after the departure of Burr from New Orleans and
</p>
<p>almost at the hour of his arrival in St. Louis on his
</p>
<p>visit to Wilkinson, Clark wrote to the General :'

<p>them that he is much their friend. . . . What in the
</p>
<p>name of Heaven could give rise to these extravagances?
</p>
<p>Were I sufficiently intimate with Mr. Burr, and knew
</p>
<p>where to direct a line to him, I should take the liberty of
</p>
<p>writing to him. . . . The tale is a horrid one, if well
</p>
<p>told. Kentucky, Tennessee, the State of Ohio, with part
</p>
<p>of Georgia and part of Carolina, are to be bribed with
</p>
<p>the plunder of the vSpanish countries west of us to sepa-
</p>
<p>rate from the Union ; this is but a part of the business.
</p>
<p>Heaven, what wonderful doings there will be in those
</p>
<p>days ! . . . Amuse Mr. Burr with an account of it."
</p>
<p>Burr was pleased with the aspect of affairs in
</p>
<p>Louisiana and wrote his daughter that he had promised
</p>
<p>to return the next fall. Having spent a fortnight in
</p>
<p>New Orleans, where he had attached to his interests the
</p>
<p>Mexican Association, the adventurers, and the revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary element, Burr, mounted on horses provided by
</p>
<p>Clark, set out on his return overland. His first stop
</p>
<p>was at Natchez, where a week was spent among those
</p>
<p>who were eager to engage in a war with Spain,
</p>
<p>to punish the so-called invaders of the country. From
</p>
<p>Natchez he proceeded to Nashville, hazarding four
</p>
<p>hundred and fifty miles of wilderness. On August 6th
</p>
<p>he was again domiciled with Jackson, who was, as
</p>
<p>Burr described him at the time, a man of intelligence
</p>
<p>and a prompt, frank, ardent soul. A public dinner
</p>
<p>was now spread in Burr's honor at the capital, where
</p>
<p>toasts were drunk of a nature to leave no doubt as
</p>
<p>to the sympathies of the audience. Then he passed
</p>
<p>to Lexington, where he was the recipient of hospi-
</p>
<p>talities such as only Southerners of that day knew
</p>
<p>how to dispense. The last day of August Burr was

</p>
<p>fort, where he was once more quartered with John
</p>
<p>Brown, a distinguished citizen who had for years been
</p>
<p>a prominent figure in Kentucky poHtics. On September
</p>
<p>2d Burr was in Louisville; ten days later he reached
</p>
<p>St. Louis on a visit to General Wilkinson, who had
</p>
<p>already assumed the reins as governor. Burr now
</p>
<p>learned that Pike was exploring the best route to Santa
</p>
<p>Fe; and Wilkinson heard what was not news to him,
</p>
<p>that the West and South were eager for a fight with
</p>
<p>Spain, that an army could be raised in a few days for
</p>
<p>the conquest of Mexico. To all appearances there was
</p>
<p>no break in their friendship, nor any abatement of
</p>
<p>enthusiasm. In truth it could have been no object of
</p>
<p>minor importance which called Burr at that season so
</p>
<p>far out of his way. Wilkinson attempted to depreciate
</p>
<p>this visit by repeating under oath at the trial at Rich-
</p>
<p>mond the following conversation } 
</p>
<p>''Mr. Burr speaking of the imbecility of the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment said it would molder to pieces, die a natural death,
</p>
<p>or words to that effect, adding that the people of the
</p>
<p>Western country were ready to revolt. To this I recollect
</p>
<p>replying that, if he had not profited more by his journey
</p>
<p>in other respects, he had better have remained at Wash-
</p>
<p>ington or Philadelphia; for surely, said I, my friend, no
</p>
<p>person was ever more mistaken! The Western people
</p>
<p>disaffected to the Government! They are bigoted to
</p>
<p>Jefferson and democracy."
</p>
<p>What was equally to the point, the General claimed
</p>
<p>to have written, upon the departure of the ex- Vice-
</p>
<p>President, a letter denouncing him to the Secretary of
</p>
<p>the Navy ; Wilkinson thought its text about as follows :

</p>
<p>"Burr is about something, but whether internal or ex-
</p>
<p>ternal I cannot discover. I think you should keep an
</p>
<p>eye on him."
</p>
<p>In spite of the paucity of the testimony, Hildreth^
</p>
<p>and others have tacitly credited Wilkinson with having,
</p>
<p>at so early a date, given notice of the approaching dan-
</p>
<p>ger. There are, however, no available data to show that
</p>
<p>his interest in the career of Burr had flagged, for we
</p>
<p>find him carefully fostering the deception that Burr
</p>
<p>sought to be returned to Congress. When Burr left
</p>
<p>St. Louis for Vincennes, capital of Indiana Territory,
</p>
<p>which place he reached September 23d, he carried with
</p>
<p>him this letter from Wilkinson to Governor William
</p>
<p>Henry Harrison:^
</p>
<p>''I will demand from your friendship a boon in its
</p>
<p>influence co-extensive with the Union; a boon, perhaps,
</p>
<p>on which the Union may much depend; a boon which
</p>
<p>may serve me, may serve you, and disserve neither. . . .
</p>
<p>If you ask, What is this important boon which I so
</p>
<p>earnestly crave? I will say to you, return the bearer to
</p>
<p>the councils of our country, where his talents and abilities
</p>
<p>are afl-important at the present moment."
</p>
<p>From Vincennes, at the time he set out for Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, Burr wrote Wilkinson that the matter of which
</p>
<p>he had written had not been mentioned in his conversa-
</p>
<p>tion. But whether the General had or had not discoun-
</p>
<p>tenanced Burr's projects, there were not wanting those
</p>
<p>who looked askance at his Western meanderings. Be-
</p>

</p>
<p>papers attributed to him as many plots as the ingenuity
</p>
<p>of the sensation-monger could conjure up.
</p>
<p>"We have been frequently asked," explained the editor
</p>
<p>of the Lexington Gazette, "why we have paid such atten-
</p>
<p>tion to the movements of Mr. Burr since his arrival in
</p>
<p>the Western country. The latter part of his political
</p>
<p>career, fraught, perhaps, with a degree of duplicity which
</p>
<p>can never be satisfactorily defended, has made him an
</p>
<p>object of attention wherever he has traveled. His talents
</p>
<p>for intrigue are considered as unrivalled in America, and
</p>
<p>his disposition doubted by few. The subsequent queries
</p>
<p>have lately appeared in the Gazette of the United States.
</p>
<p>Whether any circumstances have come to the knowledge
</p>
<p>of the writer which would justify such a publication, we
</p>
<p>are uninformed. Without giving an opinion as to his
</p>
<p>views in this country, we publish the queries, ... at
</p>
<p>the same time believing that if he calculated on with-
</p>
<p>drawing the affections of the people of the Western
</p>
<p>States from their Government, he will find himself
</p>
<p>deceived, if he has not already made the discovery." ^
</p>
<p>Here are the queries alluded to :
</p>
<p>"How long will it be before we shall hear of Colonel
</p>
<p>Burr being at the head of a revolutionary party on the
</p>
<p>Western waters? Is it a fact that Colonel Burr has
</p>
<p>formed a plan to engage the adventurous and enterprising
</p>
<p>young men from the Atlantic States to Louisiana? Is it
</p>
<p>one of the inducements that an immediate convention
</p>
<p>will be called from the States bordering on the Ohio and
</p>
<p>Mississippi to form a separate government ? Is it another
</p>
<p>that all the public lands are to be seized and partitioned
</p>
<p>among these States, except what is reserved for the war-
</p>
<p>like friends and followers of Burr in the revolution? Is
</p>
<p>it part of the plan for the new States to grant the new
</p>
<p>lands in bounties to entice inhabitants from the Atlantic

<p>the military posts at New Orleans and on the Mississippi
</p>
<p>be in the hands of Colonel Burr's revolutionary party r
</p>
<p>How soon will Colonel Burr engage in the reduction^ of
</p>
<p>Mexico by granting liberty to its inhabitants, and seizing
</p>
<p>on its treasures, aided by British ships and forces? What
</p>
<p>difficulty can there be in completing a revolution m one
</p>
<p>summer, among the Western States, when they will gain
</p>
<p>the Congress lands, will throw off the public debt, will
</p>
<p>seize their own revenues, and enjoy the plunder of
</p>
<p>Spain?"
</p>
<p>To say the least, this was a remarkable set of inter-
</p>
<p>rogations; and what was equally remarkable was the
</p>
<p>avidity with which it was seized on by the press and
</p>
<p>circulated with added comment from border to border
</p>
<p>of the country. It was a sensational story, and whether
</p>
<p>it were the product of some quill-driver of a partisan
</p>
<p>sheet, or the naked fact, the readers of the "yellow"
</p>
<p>journals of that day had no means of ascertaining.
</p>
<p>They rarely questioned ; in the absence of the telegraph
</p>
<p>it was no easy task to verify a report, and such writers
</p>
<p>as John Wood and Duane, Cheetham and Callender
</p>
<p>never pothered over uncertainties. In the West at this
</p>
<p>time the papers were a unit in denouncing the unfair
</p>
<p>and altogether slanderous insinuations that the fron-
</p>
<p>tiersmen were eager for lawless measures. But in spite
</p>
<p>of expressions of affection for the Constitution and
</p>
<p>for the Union, the impression spread abroad that the
</p>
<p>West was once more on the verge of slipping under
</p>
<p>the Spanish yoke; or, indeed, of enlisting under the
</p>
<p>banner of an adventurer. In this way the country was
</p>
<p>gradually prepared for the events of the ensuing year.

</p>
<p>July  a month before Clark reported the rumors from
</p>
<p>New Orleans, weeks before the newspapers took up the
</p>
<p>alarm  the news had reached our warlike neighbors
</p>
<p>in Texas that Aaron Burr, ex- Vice-President, had come
</p>
<p>to New Orleans under military escort, and that it was
</p>
<p>reported he meditated some extraordinary enterprise,
</p>
<p>the exact nature of which was still in doubt/ Like-
</p>
<p>wise the stirring news spread eastward. On August 4th,
</p>
<p>while Burr was emerging from the wilderness to the
</p>
<p>south of Nashville, Merry hastened to communicate to
</p>
<p>Lord Mulgrave that the scheme had been betrayed or
</p>
<p>had been ruined through publicity :
</p>
<p>''Notwithstanding that the confidential person, whom,
</p>
<p>as I had the honor to mention to your lordship in my
</p>
<p>despatch No. 22 [March 29th] Mr. Burr had said that
</p>
<p>he intended to send to me, has not as yet appeared, I learn
</p>
<p>that that gentleman has commenced his plan in the West-
</p>
<p>ern country, and apparently with much success, although
</p>
<p>it would seem, that he or some of his agents have either
</p>
<p>been indiscreet in their communications, or have been
</p>
<p>betrayed by some person, in whom they considered that
</p>
<p>they had reason to confide, for the object of his journey
</p>
<p>has now begun to be noticed in the public prints, where
</p>
<p>it is said that a convention is to be called immediately
</p>
<p>from the States bordering on the Ohio and Mississippi
</p>
<p>for the purpose of forming a separate government. It
</p>
<p>is, however, possible that the business may be so far
</p>
<p>advanced as, from the nature of it, to render any further
</p>
<p>secrecy impossible. The best accounts of Mr. Burr were
</p>
<p>from St. Louis, from whence he had proceeded to New
</p>
<p>Orleans, and it is observed that he had been received

<p>everywhere with the most marked attention." ^

</p>
<p>had passed since the notable letter of March 29th had
</p>
<p>been dispatched  and yet the home Government was
</p>
<p>silent. The Minister should have taken the hint. But
</p>
<p>far from that, his enthusiasm was unbounded when he
</p>
<p>learned through current rumor that the undertaking
</p>
<p>was actually begun. Here was a triumph to boast of,

<p>for had he not rendered an early account of it to the

<p>had come through the medium of the press, and Yrujo

<p>read the same paragraphs and inclosed them to
</p>
<p>Cevallos, the Spanish Minister of State, with a letter
</p>
<p>dated August 5th, one day after Merry had penned

<p>his account. Referring to Burr's secret interviews with
</p>
<p>with the English Minister, his demand for a passport
</p>
<p>to Mexico, the draughting instruments, he registered
</p>
<p>again his suspicions, adding, however, that the West
</p>
<p>at the moment was unripe for Burr's designs, and

<p>scoffing at the idea of an attack on Mexico. In con-
</p>
<p>clusion, Yrujo showed in a paragraph that he had al-

</p>
<p>Burros Intrigues,
</p>
<p>WHEN Aaron Burr had returned to Washing-
</p>
<p>ton from his summer in the West, he was
</p>
<p>fully satisfied that his project could fail only
</p>
<p>for want of the "sinews of war." Everywhere through
</p>
<p>the Western country he had been applauded as the
</p>
<p>leader who was to march an army to the heart of the
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Mexico, giving freedom to her enslaved
</p>
<p>millions, and, incidentally, fortunes to his followers.
</p>
<p>The Westerners  excitable, sympathetic, liberty-lov-
</p>
<p>ing, and patriotic  longed for an opportunity to reta-
</p>
<p>liate against Spain for insults of long standing, and
</p>
<p>they were ready to accept the smallest provocation as
</p>
<p>excuse for an assault on her decaying empire. Burr
</p>
<p>gave them to understand that a war with their old
</p>
<p>oppressor was only a matter of time ; that the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment would not interfere with his plans ; while to some
</p>
<p>he said that an expedition for the invasion of the Span-
</p>
<p>ish territories would be formed regardless of cause or
</p>
<p>consequence. It was against this emergency that he
</p>
<p>needed half a million dollars; and in the pursuit of
</p>
<p>which he invoked all his powers of dissimulation  con-
</p>
<p>duct which has come in this later day, from the false
</p>
<p>light thrown upon the movement to distort and con-
</p>
<p>demn it.

<p>42 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Burr's first interview with Merry upon returning to
</p>
<p>Washington from the West was a masterpiece of in-
</p>
<p>trigue. Merry scrupulously reported the whole of
</p>
<p>Burr's story to Lord Mulgrave.^ Burr opened with the
</p>
<p>remark that he thought the English Government dis-
</p>
<p>posed 
</p>
<p>"to afford him their assistance, but he observed that the
</p>
<p>information which had reached him on this head was
</p>
<p>not sufficiently explicit to authorize him to send a con-
</p>
<p>fidential person to London to make to them the necessary
</p>
<p>communication as he had promised and intended. He
</p>
<p>was therefore now obliged to try the effect of those which
</p>
<p>I might be able to convey. . . . These disappoint-
</p>
<p>ments gave him, he said, the deepest concern, because his
</p>
<p>journey through the Western country and Louisiana as
</p>
<p>far as New Orleans, as well as through a part of West
</p>
<p>Florida, had been attended with so much more success
</p>
<p>than he had even looked for, that everything was in fact
</p>
<p>completely prepared in every quarter for the execution
</p>
<p>of his plan ; and because he had therefore been induced
</p>
<p>to enter into an engagement with his associates and
</p>
<p>friends to return to them in the month of March next,
</p>
<p>in order to commence the operations."
</p>
<p>That Merry  who had more than three months
</p>
<p>earlier reported to Lord Mulgrave the successful com-
</p>
<p>mencement of the Western enterprise ; who had seen in
</p>
<p>the newspapers at least a dozen projects attributed to
</p>
<p>the ex-Vice-President  should have asked no questions,
</p>
<p>but have put in an official dispatch with his indorsement
</p>
<p>the whole of Burr's story, is more a compliment to
</p>
<p>his industry and ambition than to his sagacity or intelli-
</p>
<p>gence. Burr's fear of delay in receiving the pecuniary

<p>BURR'S INTRIGUES 43
</p>
<p>assistance led him to say to Merry that the inaugura-
</p>
<p>tion of his plan was set for March, while in reality so
</p>
<p>early a date was never contemplated. Because of the
</p>
<p>shortness of the time and the winter season it was
</p>
<p>wholly out of the question. It was announced in the
</p>
<p>West for the ensuing fall ; and the correspondence and
</p>
<p>every step taken by the conspirators show that to have
</p>
<p>been the earliest time considered. Burr's next point
</p>
<p>of deception was that he had received encouraging
</p>
<p>communications which gave him "room to hope and
</p>
<p>expect that his Majesty's government were disposed to
</p>
<p>afford him their assistance." But the truth was that
</p>
<p>neither Colonel Williamson nor any other agent of
</p>
<p>Burr had appeared or seems likely ever to have ap-
</p>
<p>peared before the English Cabinet. The fact that
</p>
<p>Merry never received a line on the subject of the nego-
</p>
<p>tiation from the Foreign Office is proof conclusive that
</p>
<p>the Government never gave an outsider encouragement.
</p>
<p>To have Merry believe the contrary, however, was but
</p>
<p>a skillful device used by Burr to secure his approba-
</p>
<p>tion of the plan; for clearly it would have been dis-
</p>
<p>astrous for an arrangement to be made through any
</p>
<p>other medium than himself.
</p>
<p>"He [Burr] was sensible that no complete understand-
</p>
<p>ing on the subject could well take place without verbal
</p>
<p>communication ; but he flattered himself that enough
</p>
<p>might be explained in this way to give a commencement
</p>
<p>to the business, and that any ulterior arrangements might
</p>
<p>safely be left till the personal interviews he should have
</p>
<p>with the persons properly authorized for the purpose,
</p>
<p>whom he recommended to be sent with the ships of war,
</p>
<p>which it was necessary should cruise off the mouth of

</p>
<p>and to continue there until the commanding officers
</p>
<p>should receive information from him or from Mr. Daniel
</p>
<p>Clark of the country having declared itself independent."
</p>
<p>This splendid secret of the West declaring itself
</p>
<p>independent was not new to Merry, for the public
</p>
<p>prints, as Burr well knew, had only recently declared
</p>
<p>that a convention was soon to be called for just such a
</p>
<p>purpose. But in reality if such a proposition was ever
</p>
<p>mooted save by industrious editors there is no trace
</p>
<p>of it.
</p>
<p>Ostensibly to secure the success of his undertaking
</p>
<p>Burr now requested that to his former estimate of
</p>
<p>naval strength should be added a number of 
</p>
<p>"smaller vessels; because the overture which had been
</p>
<p>made to him at New Orleans from a person of the greatest
</p>
<p>influence in East and West Florida and the information
</p>
<p>he had otherwise acquired respecting the state of those
</p>
<p>countries, having convinced him that they are equally
</p>
<p>disposed to render themselves independent; and while he
</p>
<p>had good reason to believe that the same spirit prevails
</p>
<p>in many other parts of the Spanish dominions on this
</p>
<p>continent, such force with that which he should be able
</p>
<p>to provide would be required to defend the entrance of
</p>
<p>the river and the coasts of Florida and to keep up a
</p>
<p>free communication with the sea and those places where
</p>
<p>it might be found expedient to act."
</p>
<p>Here was indeed another lever, which, so far as
</p>
<p>Burr could see, promised to be effective; but which in
</p>
<p>reality worked greatly to the injury of his cause 
</p>
<p>if there had ever been a chance for it. So long as an
</p>
<p>attack on the integrity of the Union was in contempla-
</p>
<p>tion. King George might be expected to open his

</p>
<p>"other places where it might be found expedient to act"
</p>
<p>within the scope of action was to close all avenues
</p>
<p>securely. True, England was at war with Spain, and
</p>
<p>an attack on the enemy, to all appearances, would be
</p>
<p>welcomed; but Burr was not aware that the British
</p>
<p>Ministry, while aiding Miranda, the South American
</p>
<p>patriot, in a minor way, were already considering
</p>
<p>plans for the absorption of the Spanish colonies, and
</p>
<p>would therefore look upon his enlarged scheme with
</p>
<p>disapprobation. In this connection Burr spoke of
</p>
<p>Miranda :
</p>
<p>"At the last meeting I had with Mr. Burr," said
</p>
<p>Merry, "he told me that he had just received notice from
</p>
<p>New York of the arrival there from England of General
</p>
<p>Aliranda who appeared by his information to have been
</p>
<p>sent to this country by his Majesty's government, to co-
</p>
<p>operate with him in the plan of operations against South
</p>
<p>America."
</p>
<p>So there was a "plan of operations against South
</p>
<p>America." Burr, however, disparaged Miranda's char-
</p>
<p>acter, declaring that he possessed neither discretion nor
</p>
<p>talents. But if either Miranda or Burr thought Eng-
</p>
<p>land disposed to carry on an unselfish war for the
</p>
<p>independence of Spanish America they were un-
</p>
<p>acquainted with the history of the Tories. The dispo-
</p>
<p>sition of the Spanish colonies "to render themselves
</p>
<p>independent" was the controlling fear of the Ministry.
</p>
<p>The situation was clearly stated the following year in
</p>
<p>an official dispatch written upon receipt of the news
</p>
<p>of the capture of Buenos Ayres by a British force :^

<p>46 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>"The great and ruling consideration which has so
</p>
<p>long restrained his Majesty from invading this part of
</p>
<p>the enemies' territories [Spanish America], has been the
</p>
<p>fear of exciting in those countries, from their known
</p>
<p>impatience of their forms of government, a spirit of insur-
</p>
<p>rection and revolt leading to consequences the most fatal
</p>
<p>and which except by the presence of a very superior force,
</p>
<p>his Majesty might not have the means of controlling."
</p>
<p>Burr never mentioned names, nor spoke in precise
</p>
<p>terms of his plans ; the results of his Western tour were
</p>
<p>exhibited to Merry only in broad outlines :
</p>
<p>'Throughout the Western country," said he, "persons
</p>
<p>of the greatest property and influence had engaged them-
</p>
<p>selves to contribute very largely towards the expense of
</p>
<p>the enterprise ; at New Orleans he represented the inhabi-
</p>
<p>tants to be so firmly resolved upon separating themselves
</p>
<p>from their union with the United States, and every
</p>
<p>way to be so completely prepared, that he was sure the
</p>
<p>revolution there would be accomplished without a drop
</p>
<p>of blood being shed, the American force in that country
</p>
<p>(should it not, as he had good reason to believe, enlist
</p>
<p>with him) not being sufficiently strong to make any
</p>
<p>opposition. It was accordingly there that the revolution
</p>
<p>would commence at the end of [March?] May^ or the
</p>
<p>beginning of April, provided his Majesty's government
</p>
<p>should consent to lend their assistance toward it, and the
</p>
<p>answer, together with the pecuniary aid which would be
</p>
<p>wanted, arrive in time to enable him to set out the begin-
</p>
<p>ning of March."
</p>
<p>Burr frequently recurred to the urgency of an early
</p>
<p>reply to his propositions, especially emphasizing the
</p>
<p>necessity of an early remittance of funds, for upon the
</p>
<p>arrival of the latter depended the march of his enter-
</p>
<p>prise. He insisted that the money should be got

<p>secretly into his hands, as he indicated in his first over-
</p>
<p>tures; and suggested that he would himself devise a
</p>
<p>way to get into his possession, without its becoming
</p>
<p>known or suspected, a part of the two hundred thou-
</p>
<p>sand pounds which the United States were soon to pay
</p>
<p>to his Majesty's Government. In the end, failing in the
</p>
<p>first plan, proviso was made that one hundred and ten
</p>
<p>thousand pounds, which he now asked of Pitt, should
</p>
<p>be credited in the names of John Barclay of Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia and Daniel Clark of New Orleans. Burr endeav-
</p>
<p>ored to impress the Minister with the revolutionary
</p>
<p>state of affairs in Louisiana, bringing up again the ab-
</p>
<p>surd notion that the inhabitants, though descendants of
</p>
<p>French and Spanish parents, were anxious to cast off
</p>
<p>their traditional hostility to England and to embrace
</p>
<p>her in the new cause.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Burr stated to me  what I have reason to
</p>
<p>believe to be true from the information I have received
</p>
<p>from other quarters  that when he reached Louisiana he
</p>
<p>found the inhabitants so impatient under the American
</p>
<p>government that they had actually prepared a representa-
</p>
<p>tion of their grievances, and that it was in agitation to
</p>
<p>send deputies with it to Paris. The hope, however, of
</p>
<p>becoming completely independent, and of forming a much
</p>
<p>more beneficial connection with Great Britain, having
</p>
<p>been pointed out to them, and this having already pre-
</p>
<p>vailed among many of the principal people who are
</p>
<p>become his associates, they have found means to obtain
</p>
<p>a suspension of the plan of having recourse to France;
</p>
<p>but he observed that if the execution of that which he
</p>
<p>had in view should be delayed beyond the time he had
</p>
<p>mentioned the opportunity would be lost ; and France
</p>
<p>would, as he knew it positively to be her wish, regain
</p>
<p>that country and annex the Floridas to it."

<p>A more convincing presentation of tHe case could
</p>
<p>48 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>not have been made ; but the EngHsh Cabinet had cause
</p>
<p>to know that it was groundless  France was not then
</p>
<p>playing for such stakes. Burr, however, was ignorant
</p>
<p>of the situation of affairs in Europe and continued to
</p>
<p>press the argument, which had always been so potent,
</p>
<p>of the danger from French interference. Merry be-
</p>
<p>lieved the whole of the story, even to Burr's forecast
</p>
<p>of the dissolution of the Republic.
</p>
<p>"He observed, what I readily conceive may happen,
</p>
<p>that when once Louisiana and the Western country
</p>
<p>became independent, the Eastern States will separate
</p>
<p>themselves immediately from the Southern ; and that thus
</p>
<p>the immense power which is now risen up with so much
</p>
<p>rapidity in the western hemisphere will, by such a
</p>
<p>division, be rendered at once informidable ; and that no
</p>
<p>moment could be so proper for the undertaking in ques-
</p>
<p>tion and particularly for Great Britain to take part in it
</p>
<p>as the present, when she has the command of the ocean
</p>
<p>and France is prevented from showing that interference
</p>
<p>in the business which she would otherwise certainly
</p>
<p>exercise."
</p>
<p>Merry, while recommending the "practicability and
</p>
<p>great utility" of the project, thought that "his Majesty
</p>
<p>may have already been disposed to take part in the
</p>
<p>affair." Thus completely had the Minister been
</p>
<p>blinded. Burr, however, realized that the winning over
</p>
<p>of the British Cabinet was quite another matter.
</p>
<p>Indeed it appeared from the unbroken silence almost
</p>
<p>hopeless. So he turned to other quarters, still with a
</p>
<p>view to obtaining the moneys he calculated necessary
</p>
<p>for his purposes. While in Washington he was cor-
</p>
<p>dially received at the White House. Yrujo said that

<p>ing the Capital the ex- Vice-President wrote Blenner-
</p>
<p>hassett concerning his plans. December 21st the latter
</p>
<p>replied :
</p>
<p>"I hope, sir, you will not regard it indelicate in me
</p>
<p>to observe to you how highly I should be honored in
</p>
<p>being associated with you, in any contemplated enterprise
</p>
<p>you would permit me to participate in. . . . Viewing

</p>
<p>tial spirit of this letter, to offer you my friends' and my
</p>
<p>own services to cooperate in any contemplated measures
</p>
<p>in which you may embark."^
</p>
<p>To this flattering note Burr sent In reply an explicit
</p>
<p>definition of the nature of, his undertaking:''
</p>
<p>"I had projected, and still meditate, a speculation
</p>
<p>precisely of the character you have described. . . . The

<p>the continent can interfere with that which I propose.

</p>
<p>Burr's revelations to Blennerhassett left no doubt
</p>
<p>as to the object in view. The contingencies upon which

</p>
<p>other the Government was decried for its attitude,
</p>
<p>whether it endeavored to conceal evidences of Spanish
</p>
<p>meanness, or tried to steer clear of the breakers of
</p>
<p>war. The President sought to ease matters by purchas-
</p>
<p>ing the Floridas. Though we claimed West Florida
</p>
<p>under the treaty for the sale of Louisiana, and had even
</p>
<p>passed a law regulating the collection of customs at
</p>
<p>Mobile, Jefferson thought the easiest way out of the
</p>
<p>embroglio was to pay out. But his plan encountered
</p>
<p>opposition in Congress. John Randolph, the one tow-
</p>
<p>ering figure in the House, strenuously opposed it ; and
</p>
<p>sharply arraigned the President for having a "double
</p>
<p>set of opinions and principles  the one ostensible, the
</p>
<p>other real." In the first case he appeared in his Mes-
</p>
<p>sage of December 3, 1805, to favor vigorous measures
</p>
<p>against Spain; in the second, three days later, he
</p>
<p>secretly appealed to Congress to appropriate moneys
</p>
<p>for the purchase of lands, a part of which he had pro-
</p>
<p>fessed to believe already ours. In the midst of the dis-
</p>
<p>cussion, January 3d, Randolph laid before the Repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives a spirited, warlike report based on the Mes-
</p>
<p>sage of December 3d. The closing resolution read that
</p>
<p>the Southern frontier was to be protected "from Span-
</p>
<p>ish inroad and insult." Indeed it went further : meas-
</p>
<p>ures were to be resorted to which meant, beyond perad-
</p>
<p>venture, conflict with Spain. By plying the party lash
</p>
<p>Jefferson succeeded in having Randolph's Resolution

<p>buried under a bill which carried with it $2,000,000

</p>
<p>carried his point, but the report of such a bill provoked
</p>
<p>more than partisan rebuke throughout the Union.
</p>
<p>"There was a happy moment," ran a paragraph in the
</p>
<p>Orleans Gazette,"^ "when the government of the United
</p>
<p>States, with every plea of justice and necessity on its
</p>
<p>side, might, at a blow, have expelled the Spaniards from
</p>
<p>our shores. It required nothing but the sanction of
</p>
<p>authority, and the generous spirit of the nation, which
</p>
<p>had left far behind the nerveless soul of the Government,
</p>
<p>would have performed the business even without a
</p>
<p>reward. ... If the wise counsels of Federal men had
</p>
<p>been listened to, we should in the twinkling of an eye,
</p>
<p>as it were, have the rightful possession of those terri-
</p>
<p>tories, which form a natural and very important append-
</p>
<p>age of our own."
</p>
<p>Editor Bradford of the Orleans Gazette was an un-
</p>
<p>disguised revolutionist, and had admitted to his col-
</p>
<p>umns, at the time of Burr's first visit to the West, an
</p>
<p>article which might have been copied in part from the
</p>
<p>annals of the French Revolution:^ 
</p>
<p>"By a war she [Spain] would have everything to lose,
</p>
<p>and nothing to win. . . . To the east the Floridas
</p>
<p>would fall into our hands without opposition, and to the

<p>southwest. New Mexico, with all its wealth, opposes no
</p>
<p>obstacle to invasion. . . . This conquest would give us
</p>
<p>the key to the southern continent ; and the soldiers of

<p>Liberty, animated by the spirit of '76 and the genius of
</p>
<p>their Washington, would go to the field, not with a hope
</p>
<p>of plunder, but to avenge the cause of their country, and
</p>
<p>to give freedom to a new world. The innocent blood of
</p>
<p>the natives, which was so lavishly spilt by the merciless

</p>
<p>Bradford did not stand alone  there were many
</p>
<p>others in the States who saw the matter as he ; for the
</p>
<p>maxims of the French Revolution were still living
</p>
<p>forces. The morbid sentiment indulged over the con-
</p>
<p>dition of the inhabitants of the Spanish colonies is one
</p>
<p>more proof that nations are ofttimes blind to their own
</p>
<p>shortcomings. For why should charity not have begun
</p>
<p>at home in granting freedom to the negro slaves ? By
</p>
<p>this it is not meant to question the sincerity of the
</p>
<p>enthusiasm of the American mind for the emancipation
</p>
<p>of the colonies of Don Carlos. On the contrary, there
</p>
<p>is every reason to believe in the honesty of the desire ;
</p>
<p>but it was so intermingled with the lust for revenge
</p>
<p>against a sovereign whose territories were coveted,
</p>
<p>that the measure of its intensity is lost.
</p>
<p>Favorable, even flattering, the situation appeared

<p>to the leaders of the conspiracy. There were few who

<p>dreamed of the difliculties to be overcome ; of the need

<p>for money and the crying want thereof ; of prejudices
</p>
<p>and distempers to be combated, which were to prove
</p>
<p>fatal in the end. Perhaps only Dayton and Wilkinson
</p>
<p>were in the innermost secret, and aided in devising
</p>
<p>ways and means. Wilkinson drew from his own expe-
</p>
<p>perience, and the intrigues with Merry and Yrujo re-

<p>flect his handiwork, while he has left us convincing

<p>54 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>''No doubt remains with me that he [Burr] has duped
</p>
<p>both the British and Spanish legations and converted
</p>
<p>them to his use, by the promise of the subversion of our
</p>
<p>Government on the one hand, and the revolutionizing of
</p>
<p>Mexico on the other."^
</p>
<p>The knowledge of the stratagem which was to be
</p>
<p>used with the Ministers was well employed by Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son when once he had begun his denunciations, for he
</p>
<p>was also aware that the country at large was con-
</p>
<p>founded by the mingling of the two sets of arguments.
</p>
<p>Although Dayton and Burr were unpractised in the
</p>
<p>art of extracting specie from foreign coffers, they
</p>
<p>> learned their lesson with so much facility that it was
</p>
<p>clear James Wilkinson had been their instructor. De-
</p>
<p>cember 1st, after his interviews with Merry, Burr
</p>
<p>reached Philadelphia whither Dayton had preceded
</p>
<p>him. There, December 5th, the Marquis of Caso Yrujo
</p>
<p>was secretly visited by Dayton, who was primed with
</p>
<p>an excellently prepared story which it was thought
</p>
<p>would bring Yrujo to the financial aid of the scheme.
</p>
<p>Dayton began by saying that he thought thirty or forty
</p>
<p>thousand dollars would not be an excessive sum to pay
</p>
<p>for certain events which were transpiring at London
</p>
<p>upon whose outcome hung the fate of the most precious
</p>
<p>possessions of the Spanish monarchy. Yrujo assured
</p>
<p>him that his master was liberal and would reward ser-
</p>
<p>vices. Thus encouraged the ex-Senator began by say-
</p>
<p>ing that he was one of three persons in this country

<p>norant of it, but not less concerned than Spain. Then
</p>
<p>he continued:^ 
</p>
<p>'Toward the close of the last session and the end of
</p>
<p>March, Colonel Burr had various secret conferences with
</p>
<p>the English minister, to whom he proposed a plan not
</p>
<p>only for taking the Floridas, but also for effecting the
</p>
<p>separation and independence of the States of the West, 
</p>
<p>a part of this plan being that the Floridas shall be associ-
</p>
<p>ated in this new federative republic; England to receive
</p>
<p>as a reward for her services a decisive preference in
</p>
<p>matters of commerce and navigation, these advantages
</p>
<p>to be secured by means of a treaty which will be made
</p>
<p>upon the recognition by England of this new republic.
</p>
<p>This plan met the approbation of the English minister,
</p>
<p>w^ho recommended it to his court. In the meantime
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr has been in New Orleans, in the Mississippi
</p>
<p>Territory, the States of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio,
</p>
<p>to sound and prepare their minds for this revolution. In
</p>
<p>all these States he found their dispositions most favorable
</p>
<p>not only for their emancipation which they evidently
</p>
<p>desire, but also for leading an expedition against the
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Mexico. This is an idea that occurred to
</p>
<p>us after sending the first plan to London; and having
</p>
<p>given greater extension to the project, Colonel Burr sent
</p>
<p>to London a dispatch with his new ideas to Colonel Wil-
</p>
<p>liamson, an English officer who has been for a long time
</p>
<p>in this country, and whose return is expected within a
</p>
<p>month or six weeks. The first project was well received
</p>
<p>by the English Cabinet ; more particularly by Mr.
</p>
<p>Dundas, or Lord Melville, who was charged with the
</p>
<p>correspondence; but as he had reason to fear dismission
</p>
<p>from office for causes well known through the debates of
</p>
<p>Parliament, the plan has been retarded ; but Mr. Pitt has
</p>
<p>again turned his attention to it. In order to effect the

</p>
<p>The conspirators never turned out a more palpably
</p>
<p>Y fictitious fabric. Yet with the strength of it Dayton
</p>
<p>f and Burr hoped to bind Yrujo to the project; and
</p>
<p>somehow to terrify Don Carlos into paying the ex-
</p>
<p>penses of an enterprise against his own possessions.
</p>
<p>The irony of it is fascinating. Yrujo was in a more
</p>
<p>treacherous situation than Merry. As for the latter,
</p>
<p>Burr employed his wiles to make him a catspaw to
</p>
<p>draw from the British treasury half a million dollars ;
</p>
<p>while the former was to contribute funds for a secret
</p>
<p>which had been contrived to entrap him, to disguise the
</p>
<p>real object of the association, and which would have
</p>
<p>been revealed to him in any case. If an assault was
</p>
<p>really to be made on the Spanish provinces, it was but
</p>
<p>plain foresight to disarm Yrujo, or better still to leave
</p>
<p>him nursing the idea that his Sovereign was aiding in
</p>
<p>the dispersion of the Power in the Western World
</p>
<p>which menaced the integrity of his Empire.
</p>
<p>The Marquis was assured that the Western States
</p>
<p>would declare themselves independent the moment the
</p>
<p>English squadron appeared off the coast of Florida in
</p>
<p>February or March ; that in order to make the revolu-
</p>
<p>tion more popular after having taken the Floridas the
</p>
<p>expedition against Mexico would be attempted; that
</p>
<p>Miranda had just been sent to this country by the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish Government to act in concert with Burr; that no
</p>
<p>opposition from the feeble Federal Government was an-
</p>
<p>ticipated ; that the United States troops were nearly all

<p>in the West, and that Colonel Burr had caused them to
</p>
<p>BURROS INTRIGUES 57
</p>
<p>be sounded in regard to the expedition against Mexico;
</p>
<p>that they were all ready to follow him and that there
</p>
<p>was no doubt they were also ready to support the rights
</p>
<p>of the Westerners against the impotent forces of the
</p>
<p>Federal Government. In the operations against Mex-
</p>
<p>ico, England would cooperate by sea; a landing would
</p>
<p>probably be made at Panuco. Dayton avowed that
</p>
<p>Burr had emissaries in the interior of the province of ^
</p>
<p>Texas, and that he had sent some also to Vera Cruz
</p>
<p>and other points on the coast with the moneys which he
</p>
<p>had already received from England ; that he meant to
</p>
<p>convert into a republic or republics the Spanish prov-
</p>
<p>inces which should be conquered or revolutionized.
</p>
<p>Yrujo observed to Cevallos that the acquisition of
</p>
<p>Louisiana had rendered inevitable the separation of the
</p>
<p>West from the Union within the space of two years,
</p>
<p>and that the Floridas would succumb to the revolution.
</p>
<p>He was confident, however, that the Administration
</p>
<p>would not be deceived by the wiles of Burr. Yrujo's \
</p>
<p>distrust of Dayton, whom he recognized as Burr's
</p>
<p>spokesman, was great. He saw at once that England
</p>
<p>had not encouraged the affair to the extent of a hundred
</p>
<p>thousand pounds, for, had she done so, Dayton would
</p>
<p>not have come to him, as he said to Cevallos, the alert
</p>
<p>Minister of State, to play the part of the "faithful
</p>
<p>thief, relating a secret, which, for many reasons, he
</p>
<p>was interested in concealing from him." Thus the
</p>
<p>main end sought had been accomplished  Yrujo no
</p>
<p>longer credited the prevailing rumors that Mexico was
</p>
<p>the objective point, for, had it been so, the conspirators

</p>
<p>clean breast of it. However, partially successful though
</p>
<p>they had been, Burr and the ex-Senator feared they
</p>
<p>had gone too far ; so, when the latter returned to Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia from a fortnight in Washington he was pre-
</p>
<p>pared to unfold another story fantastic and absurd in
</p>
<p>the highest degree. But this time, singularly enough,
</p>
<p>Yrujo was completely taken in.
</p>
<p>After referring to Burr's resolve to have nothing to
</p>
<p>do with Miranda, whom he thought wanting in many
</p>
<p>qualities necessary to lead a great enterprise, Dayton
</p>
<p>made bold to say that the English end of the intrigue
</p>
<p>had met with reverses, hinting that negotiations in that
</p>
<p>quarter were abandoned; whereas we know the hopes
</p>
<p>of the conspirators in British aid were still high. Burr
</p>
<p>had been on the eve of dispatching to London an inti-
</p>
<p>mate by the name of Wharton, continued Dayton, to
</p>
<p>renew the negotiations, when another plan had sug-
</p>
<p>gested itself :' 
</p>
<p>"This project, excepting the attack on the Floridas, he
</p>
<p>[Burr] thinks, as well as his chief friends, may be put
</p>
<p>in execution without foreign aid. For one who does not
</p>
<p>know the country, its Constitution, and, above all certain
</p>
<p>localities, this plan would appear insane; but I confess,
</p>
<p>for my part, that in view of all the circumstances it seems
</p>
<p>easy of execution, although it would irritate the Atlantic
</p>
<p>States, especially those called central  namely, Virginia,
</p>
<p>Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and
</p>
<p>New York. It is indisputable that there is in this country
</p>
<p>an infinite number of adventurers, without property, full
</p>
<p>of ambition, and ready to unite at once under the standard
</p>
<p>of a revolution which promises to better their situation.
</p>
<p>It is almost certain that Burr and his friends, without dis-

<p>closing their true object, have won the good will of these

<p>men and inspired them with the greatest confidence m
</p>
<p>favor of Burr, whose intrigues during the past year were
</p>
<p>devoted to the fanning of the flames of discord agamst
</p>
<p>the existing government in Louisiana and the Western
</p>
<p>States which he visited."
</p>
<p>Burr's "new idea," which Yrujo thought would
</p>
<p>"probably be carried into effect," was to introduce by
</p>
<p>degrees into the Federal city and its environs a certain
</p>
<p>number of his desperate followers, well armed, who, at
</p>
<p>a signal, with Burr at their head would surprise at the
</p>
<p>same instant the President, the Vice-President, and the
</p>
<p>President of the Senate. Burr would then dissolve the
</p>
<p>existing government, possess himself of the public
</p>
<p>money deposited in the Washington and Georgetown
</p>
<p>banks and seize the arsenal on the Eastern Branch.
</p>
<p>Profiting by the consternation such a blow would pro-
</p>
<p>duce, the conspirators would try to make favorable
</p>
<p>terms with the States ; but should they fail to maintain
</p>
<p>themselves at Washington, which seemed probable, they
</p>
<p>wotild burn the national vessels at the Navy Yards, ex-
</p>
<p>cept two or three frigates which were ready for sea,
</p>
<p>and embarking on these with the treasure, they would
</p>
<p>sail for New Orleans, where upon their arrival they
</p>
<p>would proclaim the independence of Louisiana and the
</p>
<p>West.'
</p>
<p>It would be as easy to believe in the truthfulness of
</p>
<p>one of Baron Miinchausen's tales as that Burr seri-
</p>
<p>ously contemplated so utterly harebrained an enterprise y
</p>
<p>as Dayton now revealed to the Marquis. If it had not

<p>deceived for a double purpose, it would be legitimate
</p>
<p>to inquire into Burr's sanity. That such a high-handed,

<p>buccaneering plot had the shadow of a chance to reach
</p>
<p>maturity could not have been believed by any one
</p>
<p>acquainted with American character, or the actual situ-

<p>ation of affairs. And yet Yrujo thought it certain of

<p>success, observing to Cevallos that ''Spain would view
</p>
<p>with extreme satisfaction the dismemberment of the
</p>
<p>colossal power which was growing up at the very gates
</p>
<p>of her most precious and important colonies." The
</p>
<p>great difficulty to be surmounted in the execution of
</p>
<p>this momentous project was ''the acquisition of half a
</p>
<p>million or a million dollars which the principals calcu-
</p>
<p>lated would be necessary to expend for provisions,
</p>
<p>arms, pay for men," et cetera. The solution was easy

<p> Burr had offered to sell his services to Spain, and

<p>Yrujo intimated that the King ought to come to his aid,

<p>for the following reasons :

<p>upon, Spain had nothing to fear for her possessions ;
</p>
<p>that on the contrary he counted on her friendship because

<p>of her obvious interest in the success of the enterprise ;
</p>
<p>that the matter of the Louisiana boundary would be
</p>
<p>arranged to our entire satisfaction ; . . . that the

<p>Floridas would be undisturbed, not only out of respect
</p>
<p>for Spain, but because his political interest demanded that
</p>
<p>a foreign nation should hold possessions both in the
</p>
<p>Atlantic States and those of the West."

</p>
<p>which would enable him to purchase ships, arms, and
</p>
<p>necessaries for the equipment of his expedition. So
</p>
<p>much was he encouraged with the situation that he
</p>
<p>wrote to Wilkinson, December 12th:
</p>
<p>"About the last of October our cabinet was seriously
</p>
<p>disposed for war with the Spaniards ; but more recent
</p>
<p>accounts of the increasing and alarming aggressions and
</p>
<p>annoyance of the British, and some courteous words from
</p>
<p>the French, have banished every such intention. In case
</p>
<p>of such warfare, Lee would have been commander-in-
</p>
<p>chief : truth I assure you : he must you know come from
</p>
<p>Virginia. . . . On the subject of a certain speculation,
</p>
<p>it is not deemed material to write till the whole can be
</p>
<p>communicated. The circumstance referred to in a letter
</p>
<p>from. Ohio remains in suspense : the auspices, however,
</p>
<p>are favorable, and it is believed that Wilkinson will give
</p>
<p>audience to a delegation composed of Adair and Dayton
</p>
<p>in February. Can 25 be had in your vicinity to
</p>
<p>move at some few hours' notification?"^
</p>
<p>Burr regretted the peaceful course of Government
</p>
<p> the non-materialization of the Spanish War ; and his
</p>
<p>characterization of the political status was eminently
</p>
<p>correct. Concerning a certain speculation  doubtless
</p>
<p>the intrigues with the Spanish and British ministers 
</p>
<p>he could only give Wilkinson hope. The reference to
</p>
<p>Adair and Dayton and the question as to the number of
</p>
<p>men which could be had were intelligible only to the
</p>
<p>General.
</p>
<p>While waiting for replies to the representations
</p>
<p>which had been made by Merry and Yrujo to their re-
</p>
<p>spective Governments, Burr continued to enlarge the
</p>
<p>circle of his associates. During the early months of

</p>
<p>1806 he approached Commodore Truxton with the
</p>
<p>proposition that he should command the naval arm of
</p>
<p>an expedition against Mexico; and to William Eaton,
</p>
<p>who was engaged in pressing before Congress a very
</p>
<p>doubtful claim to certain pecuniary restitutions, he laid
</p>
<p>bare not only the first plan, but also that which had so
</p>
<p>taken Yrujo : ''He would turn Congress neck and heels
</p>
<p>out of doors, assassinate the President (or what
</p>
<p>amounted to that),and declare himself the protector of
</p>
<p>an energetic Government." Believing in these hor-
</p>
<p>ribly criminal designs of the ex- Vice-President, some
</p>
<p>time in March Eaton called on the President and sug-
</p>
<p>gested that "Colonel Burr ought to be removed from
</p>
<p>the country" because he was dangerous in it. Either
</p>
<p>the post at Madrid or London was considered by Eaton
</p>
<p>a secure place for the exile of Mr. Burr. If anything
</p>
<p>could give rise to a suspicion of this infoimant's in-
</p>
<p>tegrity, it is this conversation wuth Jefferson. It was
</p>
<p>in March, too, that Burr applied in person to the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent for an appointment, which fact Jefferson notes in
</p>
<p>his "Anas" under date of April 15th. This coincident
</p>
<p>provokes the suspicion that Burr had bribed Eaton to
</p>
<p>prepare the ground for his personal application for a
</p>
<p>foreign appointment. Why were Madrid and London
</p>
<p>specified? Could Burr have planned to undertake at
</p>
<p>shorter range the intrigues which were then progress-
</p>
<p>ing with those courts ? It was either that or a ruse, for
</p>
<p>Burr must have known in advance what Jefferson^s
</p>
<p>reply would be. 'He had lost the confidence of the

<p>dent's words.
</p>
<p>BURR'S INTRIGUES 63
</p>
<p>In the middle of April, Burr wrote Blennerhassett
</p>
<p>that the business, which depended on contingencies
</p>
<p>beyond his control, would not begin until December or
</p>
<p>January, if ever.' To Wilkinson he said:
</p>
<p>"The execution of our project is postponed till Decem-
</p>
<p>ber : want of water in Ohio, rendered movement imprac-
</p>
<p>ticable : other reasons rendered delay expedient. The
</p>
<p>association is enlarged, and comprises all that Wilkinson
</p>
<p>could wish. Confidence limited to a few. . . . Burr
</p>
<p>wrote you a long letter last December, replying to a short
</p>
<p>one deemed very silly. Nothing has been heard from
</p>
<p>Brigadier since October. Is Cusion et Portes right?
</p>
<p>Address Burr at Washington.'""
</p>
<p>"Cusion and Portes" were officers on the frontier,
</p>
<p>Wilkinson the "Brigadier" confessed ; but Burr's object
</p>
<p>was not so much to find out whether they were "right"
</p>
<p>as to impress the general with the fact that the associa-
</p>
<p>tion was enlarged and comprised all that he could wish.
</p>
<p>"Want of water in Ohio" was a clever way of saying
</p>
<p>that thus far he had failed in his purpose with Merry
</p>
<p>and Yrujo.
</p>
<p>While these things were occurring in the East the
</p>
<p>news of warlike preparations in Kentucky was making
</p>
<p>its way across Texas and the deserts of North Mexico
</p>
<p>to Captain-General Salcedo at Chihuahua. Early in
</p>
<p>1806 Antonio Cordero, Governor of the Province of
</p>
<p>Texas, had received notice that an expedition was
</p>
<p>being prepared in Kentucky which was to overrun the
</p>
<p>provinces of Mexico. This news had reached the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor, not through the instrumentality of Yrujo, but

<p>directly from the Spanish agents in Louisiana. The
</p>
<p>report was alarming.
</p>
<p>"It is a very grave matter," responded Salcedo, April
</p>
<p>9th/ ''the information which your excellency has received
</p>
<p>and transmitted to me  that some ten thousand men,
</p>
<p>subjects of the United States, are being prepared in Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky (Quint oq), with the object of overpowering the
</p>
<p>uninhabited provinces of this kingdom and our Indian
</p>
<p>allies, with no respect for the boundaries of Louisiana.
</p>
<p>You will therefore take extraordinary precautions
</p>
<p>toward putting the country in a good state of defense
</p>
<p>by bringing up all the auxiliaries."
</p>
<p>The obnoxious Intendant Morales who had aroused
</p>
<p>hot indignation in the United States by closing the
</p>
<p>port of New Orleans, wrote from Pensacola to Viceroy
</p>
<p>Iturrigaray, 'There exists in New Orleans a strong
</p>
<p>party whose object it is to revolutionize the Kingdom
</p>
<p>of Mexico, and the conditions on the frontier are en-
</p>
<p>tirely favorable to such a design." He stated also

<p>that he had been reliably informed that the revolution
</p>
<p>was to be materially abetted by means of emissaries and
</p>
<p>papers which were to be circulated throughout the

</p>
<p>And I have neither munitions, arms, provisions, nor

</p>
<p>despatched a corporal, a trader, and four soldiers to the
</p>
<p>Tejas Indians, asking that they arm as many as possible
</p>
<p>and come to my assistance."
</p>
<p>The truth was, New Spain was in a wretched con-
</p>
<p>dition, and Morales was clear-headed when he avowed
</p>
<p>that the situation was all the Americans could desire.
</p>
<p>But the most startling note in this correspondence was
</p>
<p>the unconscious revelation of the vital purpose of the
</p>
<p>enterprise.
</p>
<p>The disingenuous disclosures of Dayton had thus
</p>
<p>far produced only in part the desired effect. True,
</p>
<p>Yrujo had been thrown off his guard, but Cevallos had
</p>
<p>not been constrained to make the expected advances.
</p>
<p>New tactics were therefore devised, and Burr himself
</p>
<p>visited the Marquis in the final hope of obtaining funds
</p>
<p>and of leaving the minister in a helpless state of in-
</p>
<p>certitude.
</p>
<p>"The principal has opened himself to me," wrote
</p>
<p>Yrujo to Cevallos, May 14, 1806;^ "and his communica-
</p>
<p>tions have confirmed me in the idea not only of the possi-

</p>

<p>both from Louisiana and from Kentucky and Tennessee,
</p>
<p>with the same object. They all consider the interests of
</p>
<p>those countries united and in conformity with those of
</p>
<p>Spain and France; but the principal, or more correctly
</p>
<p>the principals, here do not wish to open themselves to the
</p>
<p>Emperor Napoleon's minister [Turreau], as they have no
</p>
<p>confidence in him. Consequently, it will be proper either
</p>
<p>not to communicate the matter at all to that Government,
</p>
<p>or to do it with the request that its representative here
</p>
<p>remain uninformed ; for I repeat, they have no confidence
</p>
<p>in him, and this has been a condition imposed on me in
</p>
<p>the communications I have received."
</p>
<p>If Bellman's report to Madison and Jefferson con-
</p>
<p>cerning Burr's designs can be credited, Burr had di-
</p>
<p>vined Napoleon's project of absorbing not only Spain
</p>
<p>but also her American possessions, and hoped to gain
</p>
<p>for himself a slice of the crumbling empire.^ It was
</p>
<p>therefore but a part of wisdom to leave Napoleon, who
</p>
<p>was rising toward the zenith of his career, ignorant
</p>
<p>of any revolutionary scheme which threatened even re-
</p>
<p>motely to cross his own astounding plans. The pre-
</p>
<p>caution had been taken to ignore Turreau, but he knew
</p>
<p>nevertheless, through the press, which never ceased its
</p>
<p>speculations, of Burr's supposed enterprise for the sepa-
</p>
<p>ration of the States, and wrote his home Government
</p>
<p>concerning it. Mentioning Miranda's departure, he
</p>
<p>continued :^ 
</p>
<p>"The project of effecting a separation between the
</p>
<p>Western and Atlantic States marches abreast with this
</p>
<p>one. Burr, though displeased at first by the arrival of

<p>conferences with the British minister. . . . This divi-
</p>
<p>sion of the confederated States appears to me inevitable,
</p>
<p>and perhaps less remote than is commonly supposed ; but
</p>
<p>would this event, which England seems to favor, be really-
</p>
<p>contrary to the interests of France?"
</p>
<p>Turreau thought the Government ignorant of
</p>
<p>Burr's intentions ; and yet Yrujo in a letter of the same
</p>
<p>date, February 13th, remarked, "It seems that the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment have penetrated the project of Colonel Burr,
</p>
<p>and in reality I am apprehensive lest the French minis-
</p>
<p>ter fearing it prejudicial to his country has informed
</p>
<p>them." ^ It is amazing that such a perplexing con-
</p>
<p>fusion in political affairs could have existed.
</p>
<p>Having failed in his personal effort to drav^
</p>
<p>from the Spanish minister a pecuniary response. Burr
</p>
<p>tried a last resort  he threatened Yrujo with abandon-
</p>
<p>ing his favorable attitude toward Spain and with taking
</p>
<p>up again the web of his English intrigue, whose en-
</p>
<p>tangling meshes involved the Floridas and Mexico.
</p>
<p>June 9th, Yrujo in some uneasiness wTote Cevallos on
</p>
<p>the subject. Burr had suddenly ceased to visit him,
</p>
<p>and Dayton explained that this was due to the fact that
</p>
<p>the new Government in England was anxious to under-
</p>
<p>take the matter, and that Burr believed it would be
</p>
<p>more liberal with money advances as well as offer better
</p>
<p>means of protection. Dayton said that Burr was draw-
</p>
<p>ing up supplementary instructions for Williamson, and
</p>
<p>that Bollman would sail within ten days for London
</p>
<p>to lay new propositions before the Ministry, and to in-
</p>
<p>vite cooperation in an attack on the Floridas. Dayton,

<p>68 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>still the "faithful thief," informed Yrujo that he had
</p>
<p>protested to Burr against his unprincipled ambition,
</p>
<p>and would oppose the attack on the Spanish possessions,
</p>
<p>which he deemed unjust and impolitic, in the Cabinet
</p>
<p>council which certain chiefs were to hold in New
</p>
<p>Orleans in the month of December, proximo. The ex-
</p>
<p>Senator suggested that the best way to banish such
</p>
<p>ideas from the heads of the leaders was to reenforce
</p>
<p>Pensacola and Mobile.
</p>
<p>While Yrujo believed to the last that the main de-
</p>
<p>sign of the associates was the division of the Union,
</p>
<p>he had warned the officials in the Spanish provinces to
</p>
<p>be on the alert against surprise. He had, moreover,
</p>
<p>given Dayton encouragement in the substantial form of
</p>
<p>fifteen hundred dollars, and in soliciting for him from
</p>
<p>the King one thousand more along with a pension of
</p>
<p>fifteen hundred a year.^ The pension was denied, but
</p>
<p>the Minister was licensed to pay Dayton, who had in-
</p>
<p>deed demanded much larger sums, another thousand
</p>
<p>dollars. That was as far as Cevallos was disposed to
</p>
<p>go. He saw instantly that England had not espoused
</p>
<p>the cause of Burr, for at the moment Napoleon was
</p>
<p>free from Continental dangers and England was mak-
</p>
<p>ing preparations for the defense of her own shores.
</p>
<p>Cevallos further hinted that Dayton had a greater in-
</p>
<p>terest in "selling" the secret than in keeping it,^ but in
</p>
<p>a later communication intimated to Yrujo that if the
</p>
<p>United States were determined to war with Spain
</p>
<p>some use might be made of the malcontents. The

<p>minister, however, was warned against committing
</p>
<p>himself or contributing money,^ and finally in July a
</p>
<p>few positive lines declared that his Majesty did not
</p>
<p>wish to protect the designs of Burr.^ Interested as
</p>
<p>Cevallos and Godoy were by Yrujo's dispatches, they
</p>
<p>scented danger in the obviously deceitful intrigue. The
</p>
<p>truth was, Spain had her hands already full, and it
</p>
<p>would have been fatuous for her to have become in-
</p>
<p>volved in an adventure in the wilds of America which
</p>
<p>might have led to further reprisals.
</p>
<p>On the side of Great Britain a worse outcome at-
</p>
<p>tended the endeavors of the conspirators. For almost
</p>
<p>two years Burr had maintained relations with Merry,
</p>
<p>but at the end he had only his good wishes  not one of
</p>
<p>the cabinets had even so much as deigned to reply to
</p>
<p>his solicitations. And to close this phase of Burr's
</p>
<p>consummate intrigue, Merry was recalled by Charles
</p>
<p>James Fox, Chief in the "Ministry of all the Talents,"
</p>
<p>who sent out in his place David Montague Erskine.
</p>
<p>In one of the last dispatches of Merry, dated Novem-
</p>
<p>ber 2, 1806, he related the incidents of his parting
</p>
<p>interview with Burr :^ 
</p>
<p>"I saw this gentleman [Burr] for the last time at this

<p>place [Washington] in the month of June last, when he

<p>made particular inquiry whether I had received any

</p>
<p>very reluctantly, be under the necessity of addressing
</p>
<p>themselves to the French and Spanish governments. He
</p>
<p>added, however, that the disposition of the inhabitants of
</p>
<p>the Western country, and particularly Louisiana, to sepa-
</p>
<p>rate themselves from the American Union was so strong
</p>
<p>that the attempt might be made with every prospect of
</p>
<p>success without any foreign assistance whatever; and
</p>
<p>his last words to me were that, with or without such
</p>
<p>support, it certainly would be made very shortly. From
</p>
<p>these and other circumstances I have little or no doubt of
</p>
<p>this enterprise being upon the point of execution. From
</p>
<p>a circumstantial statement of the letter to which I have
</p>
<p>alluded in my other dispatch, of a large sum of money
</p>
<p>having arrived in the Western country from New
</p>
<p>Orleans, it may be inferred, that offers have been made
</p>
<p>to France and Spain, and that they are lending their
</p>
<p>assistance to the undertaking. There seems also reason
</p>
<p>to suspect that the arrival of so large a body of Spanish
</p>
<p>troops and the force which is expected added to the
</p>
<p>present state of inactivity may well be connected with
</p>
<p>the object."
</p>
<p>Merry marveled that the Government should have
</p>
<p>remained ''so long in ignorance of the intended design."
</p>
<p>It was equally marvelous that after his long acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance with Burr he should have thought him acting in
</p>
<p>concert with France and Spain. The truth w^as that
</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.
</p>
<p>Plans and Preparations
</p>
<p>WHEN the summer of 1806 was well Under
</p>
<p>way it was plain to Burr that his hope of
</p>
<p>deluding England into advancing money for
</p>
<p>his project must be abandoned; likewise the failure
</p>
<p>of the imposture tried on Yrujo no longer admitted of
</p>
<p>doubt. The only ray of consolation came from the
</p>
<p>far West where the Spaniards were reported to be
</p>
<p>encroaching on American soil. The cry of war again
</p>
<p>rang through the country ; and it soon became known
</p>
<p>that specific orders had been sent to General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>to drive the enemy beyond the Sabine at any cost  and
</p>
<p>that meant the beginning of the long-delayed struggle !
</p>
<p>The match for igniting the conflict was in the hands
</p>
<p>V^J of General Wilkinson  would he apply it ? Both Day-
</p>
<p>l ton and Burr were doubtful. Whether he would con-
</p>
<p>tinue his part or desert it depended wholly on circum-
</p>
<p>stances. They knew he would act for what appeared
</p>
<p>to be his own advantage, regardless of affiliations or
</p>
<p>oaths, regardless of traditions or friendships. They
</p>
<p>had from their intimate association with him learned
</p>
<p>his weaknesses, and it was only by pandering to them
</p>
<p>that they hoped to retain his allegiance. He had writ-
</p>
<p>ten rarely, had raised objections, and had made condi-
</p>
<p>tions which were seemingly hard to overcome. He had
</p>
<p>sent a letter to Burr in October, 1805, which was
</p>
<p>"deemed very silly"; and finally another dated May

<p>13th which Burr alleged that he destroyed at Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son's request. The General was at the moment dis-
</p>
<p>patching troops to the Sabine frontier and expecting to
</p>
<p>be ordered thither himself. That he would there pre-
</p>
<p>cipitate  legitimately or otherwise  the conflict was
</p>
<p>the anxious hope of the leading conspirators, who now
</p>
<p>proceeded to alarm him for his office, which the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent vras on the verge of assigning to another, and to
</p>
<p>beguile him with fictions as to the means and assistance
</p>
<p>which were expected. All the false batteries of Burr p
</p>
<p>and Dayton were trained on Wilkinson's position.
</p>
<p>Flagrant as the procedure was, they had gone too far
</p>
<p>to retreat. To the General Dayton wrote briefly, and
</p>
<p>his nephew, Peter V. Ogden, was intrusted with the
</p>
<p>letter, which was dated July 24th :
</p>
<p>''It is now well ascertained that you are to be dis-
</p>
<p>placed in next session. Jefferson will affect to yield ^
</p>
<p>reluctantly to the public sentiment, but yield he will. ""^
</p>
<p>Prepare yourself, therefore, for it. You know the rest.
</p>
<p>You are not a man to despair, or even despond, especially
</p>
<p>when such prospects offer in another quarter. Are you
</p>
<p>ready? Are your numerous associates ready? Wealth
</p>
<p>and glory! Louisiana and Mexico! I shall have time
</p>
<p>to receive a letter from you before I set out for Ohio 
</p>
<p>Ohio."
</p>
<p>With Ogden went Samuel Swartwout, the younger
</p>
<p>brother of Robert, marshal of New Yo'rk, who bore a
</p>
<p>letter from Burr to Wilkinson, which is celebrated as
</p>
<p>being the key to the conspiracy. Its date was July
</p>
<p>29th. The original version of it will never be known,
</p>
<p>as it w^as altered and deciphered in various ways by
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, who, four months after its receipt, auda-

<p>ciously said to Jefferson, "I have not yet taken time to
</p>
<p>74 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>render [it] to my satisfaction."^ Such an admission
</p>
<p>was rendered more astonishing by his subsequent false
</p>
<p>swearing concerning it at Richmond. The famous
</p>
<p>document, as it is generally accepted, reads as fol-
</p>
<p>lows : 
</p>
<p>"Your letter, postmarked thirteenth May, is received.
</p>
<p>At length I have obtained funds, and have actually com-
</p>
<p>menced. The Eastern detachments, from different points
</p>
<p>and under different pretences, will rendezvous on the
</p>
<p>Ohio first of November. Everything internal and ex-
</p>
<p>ternal favors our views. Naval protection of England
</p>
<p>is secured. Truxton is going to Jamaica to arrange with
</p>
<p>the admiral on that station. It will meet us at the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi. England, a navy of the United States, are ready
</p>
<p>to join, and final orders are given to my friends and fol-
</p>
<p>lowers. It will be a host of choice spirits. Wilkinson
</p>
<p>shall be second to Burr only ; Wilkinson shall dictate the
</p>
<p>rank and promotion of his officers. Burr will proceed
</p>
<p>westward first August, never to return. With him goes
</p>
<p>his daughter ; her husband will follow in October, with a
</p>
<p>corps of worthies. Send forthwith an intelligent and
</p>
<p>confidential friend with whom Burr may confer ; he shall

<p>return immediately with further interesting details; this

<p>rapidly from the Falls, on the fifteenth of November, with
</p>
<p>the first five hundred or a thousand men, in light boats
</p>
<p>now constructing for that purpose; to be at Natchez
</p>
<p>between the fifth and fifteenth of December, there to meet
</p>
<p>you ; there to determine whether it will be expedient in
</p>
<p>the first instance to seize on or pass by Baton Rouge. On
</p>
<p>receipt of this send Burr an answer. Draw on Burr for
</p>
<p>all expenses, etc. The people of the country to which we
</p>
<p>are going are prepared to receive us ; their agents, now
</p>
<p>with Burr, say that if we will protect their religion, and
</p>
<p>will not subject them to a foreign Power, that in three
</p>
<p>weeks all will be settled. The gods invite us to glory and
</p>
<p>fortune ; it remains to be seen whether we deserve the
</p>
<p>boon. The bearer of this goes express to you. He is a
</p>
<p>man of inviolable honor and perfect discretion, formed
</p>
<p>to execute rather than project, capable of relating facts
</p>
<p>with fidelity, and incapable of relating them otherwise ;
</p>
<p>he is thoroughly informed of the plans and intentions of
</p>
<p>Burr, and will disclose to you as far as you require, and
</p>
<p>no further. He has imbibed a reverence for your char-
</p>
<p>acter, and may be embarrassed in your presence ; put him
</p>
<p>at ease, and he will satisfy you."
</p>
<p>This letter has been grossly misinterpreted. With
</p>
<p>all Burr's misrepresentations there is not the faintest
</p>
<p>hint that New Orleans was to be sacrificed ; no allusion
</p>
<p>to a convention which was to be called for the purpose
</p>
<p>of declaring the independence of the Western States 
</p>
<p>a point which had borne great weight in the Spanish
</p>
<p>and English intrigues ;  but we are told plainly that an
</p>
<p>attack was to be made on the Spanish possessions, pos-
</p>
<p>sibly beginning with West Florida at Baton Rouge.
</p>
<p>If policy dictated, wdiich Wilkinson was to decide, that
</p>
<p>Baton Rouge should remain unmolested, they would

<p>pass on  and to no other place than Mexico. "The

<p>that if we will protect their religion, and will not sub-
</p>
<p>ject them to a foreign power, that in three weeks all
</p>
<p>will be settled." There had been Spanish agents with
</p>
<p>Burr, and one Fernandez had contracted in Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia for a quantity of type destined for Mexico and cast
</p>
<p>for the Spanish language/ And we shall see that thei;e
</p>
<p>were other Mexicans interested in the cause. It was
</p>
<p>only in the matter of his resources that Burr attempted
</p>
<p>deception.
</p>
<p>Toward the end of July, Ogden and Swartwout
</p>
<p>started on their journey. A little later Bollman sailed
</p>
<p>for New Orleans bearing a duplicate of Burr's letter
</p>
<p>to Wilkinson, which the General received in due season.
</p>
<p>The first week in August, Burr  accompanied by his
</p>
<p>daughter, a Colonel De Pestre, who had suffered in the
</p>
<p>French Revolution, and who now lived in New Jersey,
</p>
<p>and a few friends and servants  followed Ogden and
</p>
<p>Swartwout over the Alleghanies. While stopping in
</p>
<p>Pittsburg, August 22d, Burr and De Pestre visited
</p>
<p>Colonel George Morgan, who resided near Cannons-
</p>
<p>burg, fifteen miles distant; there, during the progress
</p>
<p>of the dinner, Burr talked volubly. The Morgans
</p>
<p>afterwards testified that he observed that with two
</p>
<p>hundred men the President and Congress could be
</p>
<p>driven into the Potomac ; that with five hundred New
</p>
<p>York City might be taken; and also, they admitted,
</p>
<p>averred in a jocular way that a "separation of the
</p>
<p>States must ensue as a natural consequence in four or
</p>
<p>five years."^

<p>PLANS AND PREPARATIONS 77
</p>
<p>Apart from the utter nonsense of the first two
</p>
<p>propositions  which no sane man could have seriously
</p>
<p>uttered  a natural separation of the States in the
</p>
<p>course of time was not in harmony with Burr's precipi-
</p>
<p>tate measures. When Burr had gone, Colonel Morgan
</p>
<p>invited the Chief- Justice of Pennsylvania, Presley
</p>
<p>Neville, and Samuel Roberts to hear his account of the
</p>
<p>meeting with the ex-Vice-President. The two latter
</p>
<p>wTote conjointly to Madison that "To give a correct
</p>
<p>written statement of these conversations would perhaps
</p>
<p>be as unnecessary as it would be difficult. . . . Indeed,
</p>
<p>according to our informants, much more was to be cal-
</p>
<p>culated from the manner in which things were said,
</p>
<p>and hints given, than from the words used." While
</p>
<p>predicting the separation of the States in the course of
</p>
<p>four or five years, Burr also spoke of a wide field about
</p>
<p>to be opened for talented and military men.^ The Mor-
</p>
<p>gans forgot to relate this fact at Richmond.^ More-
</p>
<p>over, George Morgan, in a letter to the President in
</p>
<p>January, 1807, after referring to the incident of the
</p>
<p>above meeting in which '^I and my sons had opened to
</p>
<p>them [Neville and Roberts] our opinions of Colonel
</p>
<p>^Neville and Roberts to Madison, October 7, 1806; Letters
</p>
<p>in Relation.
</p>
<p>^The Morgans went out of their way to show the President
</p>
<p>that they were his humble servants. When the trial was over at
</p>
<p>Richmond they returned through Washington and left a note at
</p>
<p>the White House : "The three Morgans of Morganza have, from
</p>
<p>respect for Mr. Jefferson, called at his residence although know-
</p>
<p>ing him to be from the city." It may be interesting to note that
</p>
<p>this family had once attempted to found a colony at New Madrid,
</p>
<p>a site opposite the mouth of the Ohio, under the aegis of the
</p>
<p>Spanish Crown; and had been vainly pressing before Congress
</p>
<p>since 1784 a claim to lands in Indiana, said to have been bought

<p>Burr's views,"^ questioned the patriotism of Neville,
</p>
<p>soldier of the Revolution and leader of the forces sent
</p>
<p>by President Washington to quell the Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>riots. Neville had established a rendezvous for the
</p>
<p>"genteelly disaffected," Morgan likewise noted that it
</p>
<p>was said a former aide of his was frequently there; and
</p>
<p>that
</p>
<p>"a Mr. Spence or Spencer, of the American navy, has
</p>
<p>lately been with him [Neville], and declared the disaffec-
</p>
<p>tion of every officer in it. Being too far advanced in life
</p>
<p>to take an active part in these inquiries, I leave them to
</p>
<p>my sons ; who, I am happy to say, have imbibed the prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of their father and of Thomas Jefferson from the
</p>
<p>commencement of our revolutionary war to the present
</p>
<p>day."
</p>
<p>Leaving Pittsburg, Burr and party continued to
</p>
<p>Belpre, and at the appointed time set foot on the island
</p>
<p>in the Ohio, where a most enthusiastic reception was
</p>
<p>tendered them. Blennerhassett, who had devoted his
</p>
<p>life to science and music, had been at last called into
</p>
<p>action by his failing fortune and maturing family. He
</p>
<p>had, apart from his island property, about thirty thou-
</p>
<p>sand dollars invested ; but from this he derived so little
</p>
<p>income that he was always pressed for money. He
</p>
<p>was eager to reestablish himself by some bold stroke of
</p>
<p>speculation. Such an opportunity Burr at once pre-
</p>
<p>sented in the purchase of the Washita lands, a Spanish
</p>
<p>grant to Baron Bastrop, in the heart of Louisiana 
</p>
<p>areas in time to be worth their millions. Moreover, be-
</p>
<p>yond this positive investment was another and greater

<p>possibility. In the contingency of a war with Spain,

</p>
<p>which was deemed inevitable, from the position they
</p>
<p>should occupy on the frontier, the route was open to
</p>
<p>the wealth and empire of Mexico. Blennerhassett was
</p>
<p>captivated, borne away with the promise of things.
</p>
<p>Preparations were begun without delay; the last days
</p>
<p>of August found Burr and his associate in Marietta,
</p>
<p>where they purchased, through the firm of Dudley
</p>
<p>Woodbridge & Company, one hundred barrels of pork
</p>
<p>and let the contract to Colonel Barker  whose estab-
</p>
<p>lishment was seven miles above the town on the Mus-
</p>
<p>kingum  for fifteen boats to be delivered the ninth of
</p>
<p>December. This fact alone explodes the oft-repeated
</p>
<p>statement that Burr planned to move down the Ohio
</p>
<p>by November i5th.^
</p>
<p>During one of these visits to Marietta, early in
</p>
<p>September, Blennerhassett showed Woodbridge a map
</p>
<p>of Mexico, "stating its advantages, wealth, fertility,
</p>
<p>and healthiness," and asked him to join the expedi-
</p>
<p>tion. Woodbridge inferred from this, he said at the
</p>
<p>trial,^ that the enterprise was aimed at Mexico. Blen-
</p>
<p>nerhassett in his prison at Richmond, when told of
</p>
<p>this evidence, set down in his Journal, "He has not yet
</p>
<p>told all the truth  having suppressed my communica-
</p>
<p>tion to him of our designs being unequivocally against
</p>
<p>Mexico."
</p>
<p>The island became forthwith the center of multi-
</p>
<p>farious activities. A kiln was erected for drying corn,
</p>
<p>which was ground into meal and made ready for

<p>for Mrs. Blennerhassett and the two sons were also

</p>
<p>of the expedition which was to make them all rich;
</p>
<p>and shortly there were many as enthusiastic as Blenner-

<p>hassett himself.
</p>
<p>"A number of young men," said a correspondent of
</p>
<p>Pittsburg, ''inhabitants of this town, amounting to seven,
</p>
<p>have set out with an intention to join Colonel Burr in
</p>
<p>his expedition against Mexico, among whom is Morgan
</p>
<p>Neville, son of General Presley Neville, and it is said,
</p>
<p>with the knowledge and consent of his father. . . .
</p>
<p>Also Thomas Butler, son of the late Colonel Butler ; Mr.

</p>
<p>to promote it. Wilkins and his sons warmly advocated

<p>it." ^
</p>
<p>To this paragraph the editor of the National Intel-
</p>
<p>ligencer appended the following comment :
</p>
<p>"From the above letter it would seem that some of
</p>
<p>the first characters in Pittsburg are implicated in the Burr

<p>templated. Men of tried worth and known patriotism

</p>
<p>Apart from the enlistment of recruits and manifold
</p>
<p>duties, Blennerhassett is credited v^ith having contrib-
</p>
<p>uted a series of articles to the Ohio Gazette setting
</p>
<p>forth the expediency of a separation of the Western
</p>
<p>from the Eastern States. By whomever written, the

<p>Meantime Burr had traveled many miles. Septem-
</p>
<p>ber 4, 1806, he entered Cincinnati, and became the
</p>
<p>guest of John Smith. He remained there several days,
</p>
<p>talking much of his settlement on the Washita, of the
</p>
<p>threatening w^ar, and of the expedition to Mexico.
</p>
<p>The intriguer next crossed the Ohio to Lexington, and
</p>
<p>then passed into Tennessee, stopping again with An-

<p>drew Jackson. The approaching Spanish war was on
</p>
<p>every tongue. Parton says, "Every militiaman in the
</p>
<p>West was furbishing his accoutrements and awaiting
</p>
<p>the summons to the field." At a public dinner given
</p>
<p>Burr in Nashville, September 27th, Jackson offered the
</p>
<p>old toast: "Millions for defense; not one cent for
</p>
<p>tribute."

</p>
<p>He stated that the menacing attitude of the Spanish
</p>
<p>forces "already encamped within the Hmits of our Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment" required that the miHtia should be ready for
</p>
<p>instant duty. He recited that the enemy had captured
</p>
<p>several citizens of the United States ; had cut down our
</p>
<p>flag in the Caddo nation ; had compelled a party in the
</p>
<p>employ of the Government to return fromx exploring
</p>
<p>the Red River; "and had taken up an unjustifiable and
</p>
<p>insulting position east of the river Sabine, in the Terri-
</p>
<p>tory of Orleans." War was regarded as all but begun.
</p>
<p>Jackson communicated to the President his willingness
</p>
<p>to serve the country, and those who have followed his
</p>
<p>career know what that willingness meant. Jefferson
</p>
<p>replied December 3d to this first volunteer for the
</p>
<p>Spanish war '} 
</p>
<p>"Always a friend to peace, and believing it to pro-
</p>
<p>mote eminently the happiness and prosperity of mankind,
</p>
<p>I am ever unwilling that it should be disturbed as long
</p>
<p>as the rights and interests of the nation can be preserved.
</p>
<p>But whenever hostile aggressions on these require a
</p>
<p>resort to war, we must meet our duty, and convince the
</p>
<p>world that we are just friends and brave enemies."
</p>
<p>Jefferson chose still to philosophize, to remain non-
</p>
<p>committal; but to have been frank he ought to have
</p>
<p>said to Jackson that for the present all idea of war
</p>
<p>with Spain had been abandoned ; that orders had gone
</p>
<p>forward to Wilkinson on the Sabine to remain abso-
</p>
<p>lutely on the defensive, and that he believed a truce
</p>
<p>had already been agreed upon by the contending
</p>
<p>armies.

<p>PLANS AND PREPARATIONS 83
</p>
<p>The first week in October Burr met at Lexington
</p>
<p>Blennerhassett, Theodosia Alston and her husband.
</p>
<p>They had come away from the island, leaving it in the
</p>
<p>care of Mrs. Blennerhassett. Henceforth Lexington
</p>
<p>w^as to be the rendezvous, and there the organization
</p>
<p>was to be perfected. The purchase of the Bastrop
</p>
<p>lands was now effected.
</p>
<p>While Louisiana was under the Spanish flag, Baron
</p>
<p>de Bastrop had secured the grant of a tract of land,
</p>
<p>comprising about one million acres, situated in what is
</p>
<p>now North Louisiana on the Washita (Ouachita)
</p>
<p>River. Three-fifths of this had been obtained by
</p>
<p>Colonel Charles Lynch of Kentucky; but there were
</p>
<p>still some outstanding debts against the grant which he
</p>
<p>could not meet. At this juncture Burr contracted to
</p>
<p>take the whole under the following stipulations:
</p>
<p>"Colonel Burr was to pay Edward Livingston," testi-
</p>
<p>fied Lynch,^ "the amount of my purchase ; he also paid
</p>
<p>me four or five thousand dollars in money, and was to
</p>
<p>take up certain paper which I valued at thirty thousand
</p>
<p>dollars more." The deeds were recorded in Lexington,
</p>
<p>and now in truth a long step forward in the programme
</p>
<p>had been made.
</p>
<p>The possession of the W^ashita lands was a matter
</p>
<p>of secondary importance, and to be made use of only
</p>
<p>in case of emergency. Should the Government suspect
</p>
<p>them in their designs on Mexico, they would draw the
</p>
<p>cloak of settler about themselves ; should the Spaniards
</p>
<p>drive them back, they were citizens of a Republic capa-
</p>
<p>ble of defending them. It was above all something tan-

<p>when occasion offered. Glittering possibilities !
</p>
<p>Recruits were now daily added to the list, and all
</p>
<p>attempts to disguise the purpose of the associates aban-
</p>
<p>doned. 'The impression," says Putnam,^ "to some ex-
</p>
<p>tent prevailed that Burr's movement and purposes had
</p>
<p>some sanction of the general Government, and that in
</p>
<p>so far as they were directed against the crafty enemies
</p>
<p>of the Western settlements they deserved to meet with
</p>
<p>cooperation." According to Jefferson, Burr would ap-
</p>
<p>proach men, propose his scheme, and, if they did not
</p>
<p>care to engage unless the Government approved, he
</p>
<p>would show a forged letter purporting to be from Dear-
</p>
<p>born, which countenanced the expedition, and add that
</p>
<p>because of the President's absence he had not sanc-
</p>
<p>tioned it.^ In a letter of January 3, 1807, to Wilkinson
</p>
<p>Jefferson said that persons had been enlisted with the
</p>
<p>"express assurance that the projected enterprise was
</p>
<p>against Mexico, and secretly authorized by this Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment. Many expressly enlisted in the name of the
</p>
<p>United States."^ That statement approximated the
</p>
<p>truth, if indeed it were not wholly true. Calculating

<p>anced; or, if peace ensued. Government might over-

<p>look the preparations as in the case of Miranda. Says
</p>
<p>Perkins in his Annals of the West, "It appears that he
</p>
<p>[Burr] meant to invade Mexico, whether war or peace
</p>
<p>ensued between Spain and the United States." Gra-
</p>
<p>ham, the Government's agent, who followed Burr
</p>
<p>southward, also bore witness to this purpose in the
</p>
<p>people, the following interview with Burr taking place
</p>
<p>at Natchez :^ 
</p>
<p>"I mentioned to Colonel Burr that I had heard in the
</p>
<p>Western country of a considerable number of men, per-
</p>
<p>haps two thousand, being collected for the purpose of
</p>
<p>invading Mexico. His reply was that he supposed that
</p>
<p>event was in the case of war with Spain. I told him
</p>
<p>no, that I had not understood it as depending on that
</p>
<p>condition."
</p>
<p>Had Burr at that moment been confronted with his
</p>
<p>three maps,^ left in the possession of Dr. Cummins, he
</p>
<p>would have been put to some confusion to explain upon
</p>
<p>what contingency he had calculated to lead his expedi-
</p>
<p>tion to Mexico. There is no hushing such clamorous
</p>
<p>witnesses, and Burr must have confessed that he had
</p>
<p>counted primarily on Wilkinson and war, and finally
</p>
<p>on the silent acquiescence of the authorities. The
</p>
<p>secret of these maps in broad outline is this : that noth-
</p>
<p>ing less than the Empire of Spain in North America
</p>
<p>was at stake. One map shows that Empire stretch-
</p>
<p>ing away to the Californias and to the Isthmus; the
</p>
<p>second is an admiralty chart of the Gulf coast of that
</p>
<p>country, indicating inlets, islands, and depths, which
</p>
<p>could have been of service only to a sea expedition;

<p>the third (here reproduced) tells its tale in the de-
</p>
<p>tailed topographical description of the region between
</p>
<p>Vera Cruz and Mexico City! Wilkinson, Adair,
</p>
<p>Truxton, and others confessed that Vera Cruz was
</p>
<p>the objective point of the sea expedition  the maps
</p>
<p>reinforce them. Had Burr's project gone forward, the
</p>
<p>world might have been treated to a spectacle in some of
</p>
<p>its aspects recalling the story of Cortez. For was not
</p>
<p>Burr to profit by internal dissensions to conquer the
</p>
<p>land where for three centuries the Spaniards had ruled
</p>
<p>as tyrants? And were not the men he hoped to lead
</p>
<p>of that rare breed known as adelantados and conquis-
</p>
<p>tadores  adventurers and filibusters?
</p>
<p>The absorbing plan of invading the Spanish posses-
</p>
<p>sions was to be determined by force and opportunity.
</p>
<p>The idea of penetrating the neighboring territories,
</p>
<p>of making conquests of them, was in the air of the
</p>
<p>time, and not due in the remotest sense to the influ-
</p>
<p>ence of Burr. He strove merely for its embodiment.
</p>
<p>Though he failed, history emphatically shows that his
</p>
<p>plans were opportune, and that their wreck was due
</p>
<p>to influences he had failed properly to estimate, and
</p>
<p>chiefly to the conduct of James Wilkinson. The Span-
</p>
<p>iards believed the conspiracy to have had a continuous
</p>
<p>existence, crediting it with the revolutionizing of West
</p>
<p>Florida in 1810, and a little later with having served as
</p>
<p>the inspiration for the Gutierrez-Magee Expedition,^
</p>
<p>which wrought such irremediable destruction in the

<p>high hopes of cooperating in the revolution which
</p>
<p>raged beyond the Rio Grande. It was in the opening
</p>
<p>year of our second war with Great Britain that  de-
</p>
<p>spite the fact that there was room in the army for all
</p>
<p>warlike characters  adventurers and revolutionists to
</p>
<p>the number of five hundred gathered along the Louisi-
</p>
<p>ana frontier and in the Neutral Ground, marched
</p>
<p>across Texas, annihilated three royalist armies, and
</p>
<p>held the province until dissensions prepared them for
</p>
<p>destruction. That Burr planned, in case of necessity, to
</p>
<p>make a "neutral ground" of his Bastrop lands scarcely
</p>
<p>admits of doubt ; many of the followers of Magee had
</p>
<p>been his loyal partisans; and those who joined in the
</p>
<p>filibustering enterprises which swept westward for the
</p>
<p>next half century were his disciples.
</p>
<p>Pursuing his tactics Burr wrote to Governor Harri-

<p>son with the evident intention of exciting him, as he
</p>
<p>had Jackson, to issue a proclamation to the militia. To
</p>
<p>keep the aggression of the enemy before the people was
</p>
<p>to raise higher their passions.

<p>addressed to the militia of Indiana not inexpedient at

<p>this moment, and that the perusal of this production

<p>As yet everything was going well; not only were
</p>
<p>boats being built, provisions being gathered, and re-
</p>
<p>cruits being prepared, but fate even seemed to declare
</p>
<p>for Burr. Every day brought more warlike tidings
</p>
<p>from the Sabine; newer encroachments and insults of
</p>
<p>the foe, and greater prospect of a violent clash between
</p>
<p>the American and Spanish armies which now stood
</p>
<p>facing each other across the Arroyo Hondo. It is plain
</p>
<p>from his letter to Governor Harrison that Burr mo-
</p>
<p>mentarily expected Wilkinson to redeem his pledge
</p>
<p>that a war could and would be brought about. Upon
</p>
<p>the receipt of such news Burr's banner would be raised,
</p>
<p>and Harrison, Davis Floyd, Adair, and Jackson would
</p>
<p>each muster a regiment for an independent army des-
</p>
<p>tined for Mexico.

<p>Wood County, Virginia, under whose jurisdiction was

</p>
<p>hostile movements and designs of a certain character
</p>
<p>[Burr]." Resolutions were passed expressing their
</p>
<p>attachment to the President of the United States ; and
</p>
<p>it was ordered that a corps of militia should be raised
</p>
<p>to act in case of emergency. ^
</p>
<p>Blennerhassett was absent in Kentucky, having
</p>
<p>gone there with the Alstons in the furtherance of the

<p>His absence, however, did not deter the boisterous
</p>
<p>mihtiamen from threatening a reprisal upon the island.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Blennerhassett became uneasy and sent her gar-
</p>
<p>dener, Peter Taylor, in search of her husband. Octo-
</p>
<p>ber 20th he set out. On his way he stopped in Cincin-
</p>
<p>nati to inquire of Senator John Smith the whereabouts
</p>
<p>of Blennerhassett. Smith, having become alarmed at
</p>
<p>the malignant rumors in circulation, seized the op-
</p>
<p>portunity to send a note to Burr demanding an ex-
</p>
<p>planation.
</p>
<p>"I was greatly surprised and really hurt by the un-
</p>
<p>usual tenor of your letter of the 23d," Burr vouchsafed
</p>
<p>in answer to the Senator,^ "and I hasten to reply to it,
</p>
<p>as well for your satisfaction as my own. If there exists
</p>
<p>any design to separate the Western from the Eastern

<p>States, I am totally ignorant of it. I never harbored or
</p>
<p>expressed any such intention to any one, nor did any
</p>
<p>person ever intimate such design to me.'^

<p>From Cincinnati Taylor rode to Lexington, where,
</p>
<p>according to his own story, he saw Burr for the first

<p>time, and opened his acquaintance with the warning,
</p>
<p>"If you come up our way, the people will shoot you."
</p>
<p>Taylor's account of this meeting is sufficient to dis-
</p>
<p>credit him utterly. On the other hand, it is plain from

<p>his evidence that Blennerhassett had told him what

<p>90 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr had made fortunes for many in his time,
</p>
<p>but none for himself ; but now he was going to make
</p>
<p>something for himself. He said that he had a great many
</p>
<p>friends in the Spanish territory; no less than 2,000
</p>
<p>Roman Catholic priests were engaged, and that all their
</p>
<p>friends too would join, if once he could get to them ; that
</p>
<p>the Spaniards, like the French, had got dissatisfied with
</p>
<p>their government, and wanted to swap it."
</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the Spanish colonies were indeed
</p>
<p>tired of their Government. This was so manifestly the
</p>
<p>case in West Florida that even the faint-hearted Clai-
</p>
<p>borne thought there would be no difficulty in acquirmg
</p>
<p>the territory. "A great majority of the people of the
</p>
<p>Baton Rouge settlement," he said, March 3, 1806, to
</p>
<p>Jefferson, "are well affected to the United States, and
</p>
<p>anxious for a change of government."^ The history of
</p>
<p>the subversion of the Spanish rule in Mexico adds most
</p>
<p>effective weight to this testimony. The priests were
</p>
<p>the agfitators and the leaders in the terrible revolt which
</p>
<p>began in September, 18 10, and which was to end with
</p>
<p>Mexican freedom. Had Burr been able to unite the ele-
</p>
<p>ments in opposition to the foreigner in Mexico, then
</p>
<p>indeed might he have been king ; and Wilkinson's taunt
</p>
<p>in a letter to Jefferson concerning Burr's overrunning
</p>
<p>of Mexico  that it would receive a new master in the
</p>
<p>place of promised liberty  would have been full of
</p>
<p>significance.
</p>
<p>The news reported by Mrs. Blennerhassett was of
</p>
<p>sufficient gravity to call her husband away from the
</p>
<p>little group of revolutionists  already diminished by
</p>
<p>the return of the Alston family to South Carolina

<p>Lexington. Also De Pestre had taken leave of Burr,
</p>
<p>and the rest to bear reports to those v^ho remained in
</p>
<p>the East, and to draw the blindfold tighter around the
</p>
<p>eyes of Yrujo. He was to pretend that the revolution-
</p>
<p>izing of the States was progressing rapidly, and to
</p>
<p>assure the Marquis that the report that Mexico was to
</p>
<p>be invaded had been circulated to hide the main design.
</p>
<p>But before De Pestre had reached his destination the
</p>
<p>Spanish Minister wrote his Government a long dis-
</p>
<p>patch on the subject :^ 
</p>
<p>*'It is indubitable that Colonel Burr and his subordi-
</p>
<p>nates are carrying out their plan. The partial discovery
</p>
<p>of their intentions instead of deterring has only confirmed
</p>
<p>them in the revolution, whose success alone can save
</p>
<p>them. Some of his associates at this place and at New
</p>
<p>York are going to meet him, in spite of the fact that the
</p>
<p>newspapers already comment on his enterprise. It seems
</p>
<p>to me to be his intention to profit by the hostile appear-
</p>
<p>ance on the Sabine to arm his friends preliminary to the
</p>
<p>rupture with Spain. I am confirmed in this opinion by
</p>
<p>a proclamation from the hand of one General Jackson of
</p>
<p>Kentucky, in which he proposed the organization of the
</p>
<p>militia to chastise the insulting Spaniards."
</p>
<p>So ignorant was Yrujo of the real posture of af-
</p>
<p>fairs in the West, he could not conceive that such a
</p>
<p>proclamation truly betokened patriotism ; it was to him
</p>
<p>a mere subterfuge, for he had been accustomed, and the
</p>
<p>conspirators had fostered his predilection, to think
</p>
<p>of the Westerners as openly hostile to the Union. It
</p>
<p>never occurred to Yrujo  the proposition was too
</p>

<p>92 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>marshaled for the conquest of his Sovereign's terri-
</p>
<p>tories, might take things by surprise.
</p>
<p>Burr's force was to consist of five hundred men,
</p>
<p>chiefly from New York, who were to rendezvous at
</p>
<p>Marietta. Then, continued Yrujo :
</p>
<p>"Colonel Burr will go down with them under the pre-
</p>
<p>text of establishing them on a great land purchase he is
</p>
<p>supposed to have made. In passing Cincinnati they
</p>
<p>expect to seize five thousand stand of arms which the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment deposited there at the time of its difference with
</p>
<p>us about the navigation of the Mississippi. After thus
</p>
<p>dropping the mask, this armed troop will follow down
</p>
<p>the course of the Mississippi. Colonel Burr will remain
</p>
<p>at Natchez till the Assembly of New Orleans has met,
</p>
<p>which will happen at once; and in this meeting (junta)
</p>
<p>they will declare the independence of the Western States,
</p>
<p>and will invite Burr to place himself at the head of their
</p>
<p>Government. He will accept the offer, will descend to
</p>
<p>New Orleans, and will set to work, clothed in a character
</p>
<p>which the people will have given him. I understand that
</p>
<p>Colonel Burr has already written the declaration of inde-
</p>
<p>pendence, and that it is couched in the same terms that
</p>
<p>the States adopted in theirs against Great Britain. This
</p>
<p>circumstance is the more notable inasmuch as the actual
</p>
<p>President was the person who drew it up in 1776. When
</p>
<p>Burr made the project of acting in agreement with Eng-
</p>
<p>land and seizing the Floridas, he expected to master them
</p>
<p>with troops that should accompany him from Baton
</p>
<p>Rouge. Although I am assured that this project is aban-
</p>
<p>doned, and that, on the contrary, he wishes to live on
</p>
<p>good terms with Spain, I have written to Governor Folch
</p>
<p>of West Florida to be on his guard ; and although I am
</p>
<p>persuaded that, by means of Governor Folch's connection
</p>
<p>with General Wilkinson, he must be perfectly informed

</p>
<p>of the state of things and of Burr's intentions, I shall
</p>
<p>write to-day or to-morrow another letter to the Governor
</p>
<p>of Baton Rouge to be on the alert."
</p>
<p>It is puzzling that Yrujo should not have known
</p>
<p>PLANS AND PREPARATIONS 93
</p>
<p>that Wilkinson's term of pensioner had expired. Had
</p>
<p>he been aware of this fact his anxiety for the safety of
</p>
<p>the southern provinces might justly have increased,
</p>
<p>although he believed the governors in that quarter to
</p>
<p>be well informed of the course of events through the
</p>
<p>press of New Orleans and Natchez. His perplexity
</p>
<p>was indeed augmented through a letter from Burr
</p>
<p>which De Pestre delivered about November 27, 1806,
</p>
<p>preparatory to his report:^ 
</p>
<p>"About eight days ago," said Yrujo to Cevallos,
</p>
<p>December 4th, "a former French officer, one of Burr's par-
</p>
<p>tisans, presented himself here; he is just from Kentucky
</p>
<p>in search of various things needful to the enterprise. . . .
</p>
<p>This officer brought me a letter of recommendation from
</p>
<p>Burr, in which he said simply that the bearer, who had
</p>
<p>recently been in the Western States, could give me in-
</p>
<p>formation about them to satisfy my curiosity. The date
</p>
<p>of this letter was Lexington, October 25th."
</p>
<p>Yrujo was assured that all was going well with
</p>
<p>Burr's affairs, and that by December 5th the adven-
</p>
<p>turers from all parts would concentrate at Marietta.
</p>
<p>The body of the message ran as follows :
</p>
<p>"He also told me, on the part of the Colonel, that I
</p>
<p>should soon hear that it was his intention to attack
</p>
<p>Mexico, but that I was not to believe such rumors ; that
</p>
<p>on the contrary his plans were limited to the emancipa-
</p>
<p>tion of the Western States, and that it was necessary to
</p>
<p>circulate this rumor in order to hide the true design of
</p>
<p>his armaments and of the assemblages of men which
</p>
<p>could no longer be concealed ; that Upper and Lower
</p>
<p>Louisiana, the States of Tennessee and Ohio, stood ready
</p>
<p>and ripe for his plans, but that the State of Kentucky was

<p>94 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>much divided ; and as this is the most important in
</p>
<p>numbers and population, an armed force must be pro-
</p>
<p>cured strong enough to overawe the opposition. He
</p>
<p>added, on Burr's part, that as soon as the revolution
</p>
<p>should be complete, he would treat with Spain in regard
</p>
<p>to boundaries, and would conclude this affair to her entire
</p>
<p>satisfaction; meanwhile he wished me to write to the
</p>
<p>Governor of West Florida to diminish the burdens of
</p>
<p>Americans who navigated the Mobile River, and ask him,
</p>
<p>when the explosion should take place, to stop the courier
</p>
<p>or couriers which the friends of Government might dis-
</p>
<p>patch, since it was desirable to delay the report of the
</p>
<p>happenings in the West."
</p>
<p>However successful Burr had been in the earlier
</p>
<p>phase of his intrigue with Yrujo, nothing could have
</p>
<p>been plainer to the Minister than that the conspirators,
</p>
<p>who had now nothing to gain from his cooperation,
</p>
<p>were lulling him into drowsy security. Yrujo would
</p>
<p>have been blind indeed had he not discovered that the
</p>
<p>Westerners were massing, not to overawe Kentucky,
</p>
<p>but to take for themselves certain properties which
</p>
<p>were destined to belong a little longer to Carlos IV.
</p>
<p>Yrujo confessed that Burr in sending him this officer
</p>
<p>had "inspired him with the liveliest apprehensions."
</p>
<p>And he renewed his warnings to the officers in Florida,
</p>
<p>Texas, and Mexico.
</p>
<p>After his interview with Yrujo, De Pestre went to
</p>
<p>New York, where he met that contingent wdiich was to
</p>
<p>have gone round by sea to New Orleans. But every-
</p>
<p>thing was now in confusion because of the President's
</p>
<p>denunciation of the enterprise through his Proclama-
</p>
<p>tion of November 27th.^ Still, hope of ultimate suc-

</p>
<p>cess was not abandoned, and De Pestre returned in a
</p>
<p>fortnight to Philadelphia, and once more called upon
</p>
<p>Yrujo, to whom he related that Swartwout, Dr. Erwin,
</p>
<p>Colonel Smith, and Captain Lewis of the merchant-
</p>
<p>ship Emperor would soon set off for New Orleans. De
</p>
<p>Pestre further stated } 
</p>
<p>"that the youths enlisted to serve as officers should set
</p>
<p>out as soon as possible for their posts. These, my in-
</p>
<p>formant told me, are different. Some two or three of
</p>
<p>them, the quickest and keenest, go to Washington to
</p>
<p>observe the movements of Government, to keep their
</p>
<p>friends in good disposition, and to dispatch expresses
</p>
<p>with news of any important disposition or occurrence.
</p>
<p>Three go to Norfolk to make some dispatch of provisions.
</p>
<p>A good number of them will go direct to Charleston to
</p>
<p>take command as officers, and see to the embarkation of
</p>
<p>the numerous recruits whom Colonel Burr's son-in-law
</p>
<p>has raised in South Carolina. He himself will then have
</p>
<p>returned there from Kentucky, and will embark with
</p>
<p>them for New Orleans. The rest will embark directly
</p>
<p>for that city from New York."
</p>
<p>This time the Marquis plied De Pestre with such
</p>
<p>questions as. Why, if the separation of the States is the
</p>
<p>object, was it necessary to prepare such quantities of
</p>
<p>provisions? and Why the State of Kentucky had be-
</p>
<p>come obstinate? It appears from Yrujo's account that
</p>
<p>De Pestre was almost driven from his ground. Indeed,
</p>
<p>he was taunted for his dissembling. Blennerhassett
</p>
<p>gave it on the authority of the Frenchman  who re-
</p>
<p>lated the whole of the circumstances to him while at
</p>
<p>Richmond  that Yrujo "pierced the cobweb tissue of
</p>
<p>Burr's intrigues with him at a single glance."

<p>96 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>'*He assured De Pestre," the Journal records,' "that
</p>
<p>had Burr opened his designs with frankness, and really-
</p>
<p>projected a severance of the Union, and nothing hostile
</p>
<p>to the Spanish provinces, he. Burr, might have had an
</p>
<p>easy resort to the Spanish treasury and its arsenals. But
</p>
<p>Yrujo laughed at the awkwardness with which Burr
</p>
<p>endeavored to mask his designs on Mexico."
</p>
<p>Such a moment of satisfaction Yrujo could not
</p>
<p>have enjoyed. It was not until De Pestre came on the
</p>
<p>stage that the Marquis realized how thoroughly he had
</p>
<p>been entrapped. He was now convinced that Burr
</p>
<p>planned a descent upon Mexico, and realized that the
</p>
<p>only barrier which stood between the adventurer and
</p>
<p>his goal was Wilkinson. So he wrote with the deepest
</p>
<p>complacency some weeks later that Spain had saved
</p>
<p>herself and the United States by pensioning Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>who had entered into Burr's design for the division of
</p>
<p>the Union, but rebelled at his plan for the conquest of
</p>
<p>Mexico. ^
</p>
<p>While Yrujo was enjoying this special confidence
</p>
<p>of the associates, the stories of the conspiracy which
</p>
<p>were already rife in the States spread naturally into
</p>
<p>the very provinces the Spanish Minister was most ex-
</p>
<p>ercised about. Some project had been ascribed to Burr
</p>
<p>as early as July, 1805, and since that date the Spanish
</p>
<p>governors had not been lacking information from
</p>
<p>Yrujo, from the press of the States, and from local
</p>
<p>connections. Although Yrujo knew Burr to be at
</p>
<p>the head of the project, with the ostensible design of
</p>

</p>
<p>disrupting the Union, the administrators in the prov-
</p>
<p>inces of Don Carlos thought the movement directed by
</p>
<p>the Government of the United States, whose object was
</p>
<p>solely the extension of boundaries. Grand Pre, sta-
</p>
<p>tioned at Baton Rouge, had become alarmed, and wrote
</p>
<p>Claiborne as early as April i, 1806, that he understood
</p>
<p>hostile preparations against his province were making
</p>
<p>in Mississippi. Claiborne replied, "Your Excellency's
</p>
<p>letter of the first instant, has been received, and to quiet
</p>
<p>your apprehensions as far as is in my power, I hasten to
</p>
<p>assure you that I have never before heard of the hostile
</p>
<p>preparations which you seem to think are on foot in the
</p>
<p>Mississippi Territory."^ But Claiborne had forgotten
</p>
<p>that he had said in a dispatch to Washington that West
</p>
<p>Florida was ready to revolt, and that hostile arma-
</p>
<p>ments were organizing. Kemper  one of the filibust-
</p>
<p>ering brothers of that name in Mississippi  bore wit-
</p>
<p>ness to that when he said that Burr's corps, which were
</p>
<p>forming in that Territory, meant to attack Baton
</p>
<p>Rouge; and Wilkinson likewise testified to the open
</p>
<p>hostility of the Territory under Meade, the latter hav-
</p>
<p>ing expressed the wish that the Spanish cavalry would
</p>
<p>intercept the General on his ride to the frontier in Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, "because if this did not happen we should have
</p>
<p>no war. The same man," said W^ilkinson, "before I
</p>
<p>reached Natchez actually talked of attacking Baton
</p>
<p>Rouge." ^ Early in the fall Vicente Folch, Governor
</p>
<p>of West Florida, was advised of the scheme and of

<p>diately hurried information to Mexico. Again, on
</p>
<p>October ist, he sent a message to the Viceroy :' 
</p>
<p>''You have already been informed of the project to
</p>
<p>revolutionize Mexico. This enterprise has not been lost
</p>
<p>sight of, and seems to be stronger than ever. According
</p>
<p>to the plan, if the weather permits, in February or March
</p>
<p>ten thousand Kentuckians, three thousand regular troops,
</p>
<p>eight or ten thousand militia from Louisiana, who will
</p>
<p>be forced to go, will march for Mexico. They will raise
</p>
<p>a corps of five thousand blacks, who will be taken from
</p>
<p>the plantations and declared free. This will make an
</p>
<p>army of from twenty-eight to thirty thousand men ; five
</p>
<p>thousand will be reserved for the city of New Orleans.
</p>
<p>Baton Rouge and Pensacola will probably be the first
</p>
<p>taken. . . . After that, Natchitoches will be the point
</p>
<p>for the reunion. Part of the army will be embarked to
</p>
<p>land at the Rio Grande. The pretext for this expedition
</p>
<p>is afforded by the presence of the Spanish troops at
</p>
<p>Adayes. Congress will act only on the defensive, but if
</p>
<p>once these troops are united they will march toward
</p>
<p>Mexico with great proclamations."
</p>
<p>Without doubt Folch had grains of truth with his
</p>
<p>chaff; but here again Burr's project was swallowed up
</p>
<p>in the larger purpose attributed to the nation. That
</p>
<p>the movement was directed wholly against Spain was
</p>
<p>indubitable. There was not a hint nor even a suspicion
</p>
<p>that the West, according to Yrujo's advices, was first
</p>
<p>to be revolutionized. To those viewing the situation
</p>
<p>at short range his disclosures appeared but idle proph-
</p>
<p>ecy; of national aggressiveness, on the other hand,
</p>
<p>there w^ere unmistakable signs, and its direction was
</p>
<p>undoubted.

<p>PLANS AND PREPARATIONS 99
</p>
<p>Amid all these eddying reports and rumors, the
</p>
<p>Government at Washington, harassed by Pitt, teased
</p>
<p>by Napoleon, and defied by Godoy, labored heedless of
</p>
<p>the gathering storm on a near horizon. It was toward
</p>
<p>the end of October before the Administration thought
</p>
<p>the matter of the conspiracy worth its attention. Vari-
</p>
<p>ous letters and the notice of the organization of the
</p>
<p>Wood County militia had been received, but there was
</p>
<p>nothing tangible in any of the communications. Octo-
</p>
<p>ber 13th one James Taylor wrote to Madison from
</p>
<p>Kentucky that the scheme in question was to seize the
</p>
<p>Congress lands and to separate the States; that Blen-
</p>
<p>nerhassett, who had fled to this country, was reported
</p>
<p>to have written the articles signed "Querist" ;^ that
</p>
<p>Woodbridge & Company of Marietta were building ten
</p>
<p>gunboats, or strong vessels resembling them, at a navy
</p>
<p>yard seven miles up the Muskingum.' Long before
</p>
<p>this, however, Jefferson had been warned that a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy was on foot in the West and that Burr was its
</p>
<p>master-spirit. As early as January 10, 1806, Joseph
</p>
<p>H. Daviess, prosecuting-attorney for the Federal Dis-
</p>
<p>trict of Kentucky, wrote the President a private letter
</p>
<p>denouncing the Spanish pensioners, and declaring that
</p>
<p>Burr's object was to effect "a separation of the Union
</p>
<p>in favor of Spain."
</p>
<p>'This plot is laid wider than you imagine," he asserted
</p>
<p>by way of a general warning. ''Mention the subject to no
</p>
<p>one from the Western country, however high in office he
</p>
<p>may be. Some of them are deeply tainted with this
</p>
<p>treason. I hate duplicity of expression; but on this

</p>
<p>Daviess knew nothing "explicit," nor was he in
</p>
<p>better position eleven months later when he swore out
</p>
<p>a process against Burr. Notwithstanding, from the
</p>
<p>date of his first note until Burr was afloat upon the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, he kept up a constant stream of denuncia-
</p>
<p>tions. In a second letter, one month from the first, he
</p>
<p>recited the itinerary of Burr during his trip through
</p>
<p>the West in 1805 ; named the men with whom he asso-
</p>
<p>ciated, dwelling particularly on his connection with
</p>
<p>Wilkinson and the Senator from Ohio. On March 5th
</p>
<p>he declared that he would raise money and pursue the
</p>
<p>plot at his own expense. "* The President had already

<p>a war with Spain was the first step in the programme,

<p>and that this was considered inevitable. "The Mexican

<p>by Daviess's wholesale charges to an investigation of

<p>the plot ; nor were his communications even mentioned
</p>
<p>among the sources of information in the Cabinet Mem-
</p>
<p>oranda of October 226., which Jefferson recorded in his
</p>
<p>own hand.' 
</p>
<p>"During the last session of Congress, Colonel Burr
</p>
<p>who was here, finding no hope of being employed in any
</p>
<p>department of the government, opened himself confiden-
</p>
<p>tially to some persons on whom he thought he could rely,
</p>
<p>on a scheme of separating the Western from the Atlantic
</p>
<p>States, and erecting the former into an independent con-
</p>
<p>federacy. He had before made a tour of those States,
</p>
<p>which had excited suspicions, as every motion does of
</p>
<p>such a Catalinarian character. Of his having made this
</p>
<p>proposition here we have information from General
</p>
<p>Eaton through Mr. Ely and Mr. Granger. He went off
</p>
<p>this spring to the western country. Of his movements

<p>on his way, information has come to the Secretary of

<p>State and myself from John Nicholson and Mr. Williams
</p>
<p>of the state of New York, respecting a Mr. Tyler;
</p>
<p>Colonel Morgan, Neville, and Roberts, near Pittsburg;

<p>and to other citizens through other channels and the

<p>to ; and in like manner to arrest and try any of his follow-
</p>
<p>ers committing acts against the laws. We think it proper
</p>
<p>also to order some of the gunboats up to Fort Adams to
</p>
<p>stop by force any passage of suspicious persons going
</p>
<p>down in force. General Wilkinson being expressly de-
</p>
<p>clared by Burr to Eaton to be engaged with him in this
</p>
<p>design as his lieutenant, or first in command, and suspi-
</p>
<p>cion of infidelity in Wilkinson being now become very
</p>
<p>general, a question is proposed what is proper to be done
</p>
<p>as to him on this account, as well as for his disobedience
</p>
<p>of orders received by him June 1 1 at St. Louis to descend
</p>
<p>with all practical despatch to New Orleans to mark out
</p>
<p>the site of certain defensive works there, and then repair
</p>
<p>to take command at Natchitoches, on which business he
</p>
<p>did not leave St. Louis till September. Consideration
</p>
<p>adjourned.
</p>
<p>"October 24. It is agreed unanimously to call for
</p>
<p>Captains Preble and Decatur to repair to New Orleans,
</p>
<p>by land or by sea as they please, there to take command
</p>
<p>of the force on the water, and that the Argus and two
</p>
<p>gunboats from New York, three from Norfolk, and two
</p>
<p>from Charleston shall be ordered there, if on consulta-
</p>
<p>tion between Mr. Gallatin and Mr. Smith the appropria-
</p>
<p>tions shall be found to enable us ; that Preble shall, on
</p>
<p>consultation with Governor Claiborne, have great discre-
</p>
<p>tionary powers ; that Graham shall be sent through Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky on Burr's trail, with discretionary powers to con-
</p>
<p>sult confidentially with the governors to arrest Burr if he
</p>
<p>has made himself liable. He is to have a commission of
</p>
<p>[Upper] Louisiana, and Dr. Browne is to be removed.
</p>
<p>Letters are to be written by post to Governor Claiborne,
</p>
<p>the Governor of Mississippi, and Colonel Freeman to be
</p>
<p>on their guard against any surprises of our posts or ves-

</p>
<p>"October 25. A mail arrived yesterday from the
</p>
<p>westward, and not one word is heard from that quarter
</p>
<p>of any movements of Colonel Burr. This total silence
</p>
<p>of the officers of the government, of the members of
</p>
<p>Congress, of the newspapers, proves he is committing no
</p>
<p>PLANS AND PREPARATIONS 103
</p>
<p>overt act against the law. We therefore rescind
</p>
<p>the determination to send Preble, Decatur, the Argus, or
</p>
<p>the gunboats, and instead of them to send off the marines
</p>
<p>which are here to reinforce, or take place of, the gar-
</p>
<p>rison at New Orleans, with a view to Spanish operations ;
</p>
<p>and instead of writing to the governors, etc., we send
</p>
<p>Graham on that route, with confidential authority to
</p>
<p>inquire into Burr's movements, put the Governors, etc.,
</p>
<p>on their guard, to provide for his arrest if necessary,
</p>
<p>and to take on himself the government of [Upper]
</p>
<p>Louisiana. Letters are still to be written to Claiborne,
</p>
<p>Freeman, and the Governor of Mississippi to be on their
</p>
<p>guard."
</p>
<p>The resolutions of the first two days indicate that
</p>
<p>the Cabinet saw possible danger in Burr's project; but
</p>
<p>the action of the third proves that they were loath, with
</p>
<p>their meagre information, to take any decisive steps.
</p>
<p>The fact that Wilkinson's derelictions were quietly
</p>
<p>passed over is only another illustration of the painful
</p>
<p>indecision which ruled at this time both President and
</p>
<p>advisers in every matter of importance. Burr's plot
</p>
<p>was subordinated to the threatening foreign complica-
</p>
<p>tions; therefore one need express no astonishment at
</p>
<p>the rescinding of all vigorous measures against a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy which, as yet, had taken no definite form, and
</p>
<p>which had been denounced only in the vaguest terms.
</p>
<p>It seemed quite sufficient to send John Graham, Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of the Orleans Territory, on Burr's path to inquire
</p>
<p>into his behavior, and to write letters of warning to
</p>
<p>the officials of the West.
</p>
<p>But if the officials of the Western States, familiar
</p>
<p>with Burr's movements, were expecting a warning of

<p>CHAPTER V.
</p>
<p>The Crisis on the Frontier
</p>
<p>WHEN James Monroe, Minister Plenipoten-
</p>
<p>tiary to England and Envoy Extraordinary
</p>
<p>to Spain, quitted Madrid for London, May
</p>
<p>26, 1805, war with Spain appeared inevitable. The at-
</p>
<p>tempt to reach a settlement of the disputes between the
</p>
<p>two countries had utterly failed. With the United
</p>
<p>States now threatening to fall upon that part of the
</p>
<p>Empire which might otherwise escape the greed of the
</p>
<p>Dictator of Europe and the English merchants, the
</p>
<p>circle of Spain's enemies was complete; it was a situa-
</p>
<p>tion from which there was no escape, and Manuel de
</p>
<p>Godoy, the Prince of Peace, looked resignedly ahead to
</p>
<p>wars and embroilments in the Hope of finding relief.
</p>
<p>The very day on which Monroe had his audience of
</p>
<p>leave with Carlos IV., May 22, 1805, Don Pedro
</p>
<p>Cevallos, Minister of State, discussed with Soler, Min-
</p>
<p>ister of Hacienda, the course the negotiations had
</p>
<p>taken. After canvassing each point which had been
</p>
<p>raised in the conferences with Monroe  admitting the
</p>
<p>justness of only one claim of the United States  the

</p>
<p>negotiations."^ The matter was more pointedly put
</p>
<p>by Francisco Gil to the Viceroy of Mexico, Jose de
</p>
<p>Iturrigaray :" 
</p>
<p>"The political situation with regard to the United
</p>
<p>States of America is darkly uncertain, because the nego-
</p>
<p>tiations which were undertaken with Mr. Monroe have
</p>
<p>been broken off on account of the fact that the claims
</p>
<p>he advanced were as ambitious and exorbitant as they
</p>
<p>were prejudicial to the rights of the Crown. The defenses
</p>
<p>of our possessions will, therefore, be looked to with the
</p>
<p>utmost care."
</p>
<p>A plan for the protection of Texas was speedily de-
</p>
<p>vised, and early in October, 1805, the posts of Bayou
</p>
<p>Pierre and Nana, to the east of the Sabine  recon-
</p>
<p>noitring stations mustering respectively forces of
</p>
<p>twenty and ten men  were occupied.^ Behind these
</p>
<p>were Nacogdoches, Orcoquisac, and Trinidad, where
</p>
<p>the real struggle for the defense of the province would
</p>
<p>be made, while further in the interior were La Bahia,
</p>
<p>San Marcos, Refugio, and San Antonio de Bexar.*
</p>
<p>While these preparations show that a struggle was ex-
</p>
<p>pected, half invited, the Americans were taking steps
</p>
<p>which promised no disappointment.
</p>
<p>January 24, 1806, Major Porter, commanding Fort
</p>
<p>Claiborne at Natchitoches, received an order from the
</p>
<p>War Department which required that the officer in
</p>
<p>command at Nacogdoches should give assurance that
</p>
<p>no further inroads would be made to the east of the

<p>Sabine, to which stream the Americans were to extend
</p>
<p>their patrols. Lieutenant Piatt with these instructions
</p>
<p>was sent to Nacogdoches. Rodriguez, the commander,
</p>
<p>replied that no aggression had been intended, but that
</p>
<p>he could not give the assurance demanded.^ Piatt re-
</p>
<p>turned with this answer, and on the first of February
</p>
<p>Captain Turner with his command, which numbered
</p>
<p>sixty, was ordered to proceed to the neighborhood of
</p>
<p>Adayes, where he would fall in with a "stationary party
</p>
<p>of armed Spaniards" which was to be commanded to
</p>
<p>withdraw beyond the Sabine. They might go in peace
</p>
<p>if they would, but evacuate they must, even at the cost
</p>
<p>of blood. So ran the orders.^
</p>
<p>On the fifth Turner arrived before the camp at
</p>
<p>Bayou Pierre near Adayes, where a mission had stood
</p>
<p>in the past century. Gonzales, the commanding officer,
</p>
<p>protested at the unwarranted invasion of his Sover-
</p>
<p>eign's territory, but signed a written agreement to the
</p>
<p>effect that the troops of his Catholic Majesty which he
</p>
<p>commanded would be transported to the other side of
</p>
<p>the Sabine as soon as the horses were in condition to
</p>
<p>travel ; or at furthest in six days.^
</p>
<p>Now indeed the fear of invasion seized both sides.
</p>
<p>The Americans trembled for Louisiana; the air was
</p>
<p>rife wnth tales of Spanish intrigues, and there were
</p>
<p>evidences of deceit and treachery. Major Porter had
</p>
<p>but two hundred effective men to meet whatever emer-
</p>
<p>gency arose, while the enemy were said to number four

<p>hundred, exclusive of Indians/ In reality the Span-
</p>
<p>iards were only fifty-one. But the permanent abandon-
</p>
<p>ment of the region in dispute was far from the purpose
</p>
<p>of Salcedo, Captain-General of the Internal Provinces
</p>
<p>of Mexico, who at once ordered to the front six hun-
</p>
<p>dred militia under Lieutenant-Colonel Herrera.^ A
</p>
<p>little later he declared that the United States by sending
</p>
<p>troops across the Arroyo Hondo had been guilty of
</p>
<p>breaking the harmony existing between the two powers.
</p>
<p>"Ever since France sold Louisiana to the United
</p>
<p>States," he went on petulantly to Cordero,"* ''nothing has
</p>
<p>been left undone to extend the limits into the Spanish
</p>
<p>possessions of the Missouri {Misuri) and Arkansas
</p>
<p>(Napertle), and to secure the twenty-two leagues of
</p>
<p>land lying between the Arroyo Hondo and the Sabine,
</p>
<p>the former of which marks the boundary of Louisiana,
</p>
<p>as the Americans well know. They are also massing
</p>
<p>troops without question of expense to hold by force their
</p>
<p>spoils. They are also intriguing with the Indians, have
</p>
<p>built a storehouse at Natchitoches and have filled it with
</p>
<p>gifts for them. It has not been possible for us to oppose
</p>
<p>them in force, but in order to counteract their influence
</p>
<p>among the Indians I have dispatched expeditions to the
</p>
<p>various tribes, our dependencies  some to the far North-
</p>
<p>west."
</p>
<p>In addition to the threatening situation in Texas,
</p>
<p>rumors of a graver nature reached the Captain-General
</p>
<p>of the Internal Provinces at Chihuahua. They were
</p>
<p>nothing less than premonitory warnings of the coming
</p>
<p>of Burr; and it is indeed astonishing to discover that
</p>
<p>thus early the officials of Mexico had received ac-

<p>counts of the nature of his plot. Burr's designs were
</p>
<p>complicated with the attitude assumed by the United
</p>
<p>States Government in the matter of the extension of
</p>
<p>boundaries, and the complication confounded contem-
</p>
<p>poraries, most of all the Spaniards. They saw the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy only as an aggressive movement against their
</p>
<p>territories, organized as it were under the wing of the
</p>
<p>Government and with the plea of vindication of rights.
</p>
<p>But the Spaniards also thought they had rights, and
</p>
<p>prepared to defend them. April 21st Governor Cordero
</p>
<p>commanded that the various chiefs of Indian tribes
</p>
<p>of Texas should be notified of the menace of the United
</p>
<p>States, so that they might be vigilant.^ By this, too,
</p>
<p>the Viceroy, who was at first inclined to ignore the
</p>
<p>movement, began to look seriously upon the crisis, and
</p>
<p>sent forward all the available troops.^
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Spanish soldiers who had lingered
</p>
<p>in New Orleans months beyond their allotted time  for
</p>
<p>no other purpose, some thought, than to create disaffec-
</p>
<p>tion, or to be on the ground to seize the city by a coup
</p>
<p>de main  were ordered away. Among those who left
</p>
<p>sullen and defeated was the dictatorial intendant, Juan
</p>
<p>Ventura Morales, famous as the author of the closure
</p>
<p>of the entrepot at New Orleans. February 15th, three
</p>
<p>days after Morales had departed. Marquis Casa Calvo,
</p>
<p>also under compulsion and bitterly protesting, set out
</p>
<p>for Pensacola. He had just returned to New Orleans
</p>
<p>from a four months' trip to Texas, where, to credit

<p>Rodriguez, he had advocated the precipitation of hos-

<p>tilities in the belief that Louisiana would espouse the
</p>
<p>cause of Spain/ Cordero and Salcedo thought him
</p>
<p>busy with carrying into effect his commission as terri-
</p>
<p>torial adjudicator, while Claiborne heard that he was
</p>
<p>tampering with the allegiance of the Indians ; that he
</p>
<p>was spreading discontent, or indeed, that he had gone
</p>
<p>to command the Mexican army.^ The nervous Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor of Louisiana rejoiced therefore at the President's
</p>
<p>determination to hasten the withdrawal of the Span-
</p>
<p>iards. Their expulsion, however, stirred up their
</p>
<p>brethren in West Florida. Governor Folch refused
</p>
<p>to permit the transmission of the United States mails
</p>
<p>through his territory, the fortifications of Mobile were
</p>
<p>strengthened, and emissaries were sent among the
</p>
<p>Choctaws. Claiborne became uneasy, and wrote the
</p>
<p>President that a respectable force was essential to the
</p>
<p>safety of New Orleans. As the summer wore on
</p>
<p>affairs calmed somewhat on the frontier, but there
</p>
<p>were too many provocations for the thought of peace.
</p>
<p>Spain had cast the die and was as determined to
</p>
<p>do nothing  her European position had materially
</p>
<p>changed for the worse  as when Monroe demanded
</p>
<p>his passports of Carlos IV. in May, 1805.
</p>
<p>"On the fourth of July [1806]," says Parton,
</p>
<p>"there were not a thousand persons in the United
</p>
<p>States who did not think war with Spain inevitable,
</p>
<p>impending, begun !" War with Spain was to be waged

<p>that the Mexicans might be free. It was in the West

</p>
<p>that this feehng reached its cHmax, and the sentiments
</p>
<p>pervading the celebrations of the Fourth of July may
</p>
<p>well be taken as indicative of their attitude. To know
</p>
<p>their attitude toward the Union, a war with Spain, the
</p>
<p>invasion of Mexico is to hold the key to the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>From the nature of things, a conspiracy with form and
</p>
<p>life must reflect the character of its adherents. Was
</p>
<p>there then in the West an element unfriendly to the
</p>
<p>Union ? Was there one animated by revolutionary im-
</p>
<p>pulses which longed to expel the arrogant foreigner
</p>
<p>from the shores of America? The Westerners made
</p>
<p>reply in unequivocal language.
</p>
<p>At a banquet in Cincinnati the following appro-
</p>
<p>priate toast was drunk : "May party spirit be banished
</p>
<p>from this land, and freedom and a union of sentiment
</p>
<p>predominate; a determination to support our liberty
</p>
<p>and Constitution inviolate." ^ Among other toasts
</p>
<p>offered at Georgetown, Kentucky, were: "The people
</p>
<p>of the United States: may their union be lasting as
</p>
<p>time"; and, "Western America: one in principle and
</p>
<p>interest with the rest of the Union." ^ In a neighbor-
</p>
<p>ing city: "The Mississippi and its waters  our high-
</p>
<p>way to market : may its trade be free and uninterrupted
</p>
<p>as its current." Then drinking to Louisiana, our recent
</p>
<p>acquisition : "May the tree of liberty flourish on the
</p>
<p>ruins of despotism"; and, "May the Western country
</p>
<p>flourish, and the golden chain of the Union never
</p>
<p>break."^ At Lexington they praised "The patriots who
</p>
<p>suffered in '76" ; and, "Thomas Jefferson, President of

<p>the United States." In St. Louis we find similar expres-
</p>
<p>sions of faith and confidence in the Constitution and
</p>
<p>the RepubHc. At a celebration given October 25th in
</p>
<p>honor of Lewis and Clark, the returning explorers of
</p>
<p>the far Northwest, these toasts were proposed: "The
</p>
<p>Territory of Louisiana  freedom without bloodshed :
</p>
<p>may her actions duly appreciate the blessing." Then,
</p>
<p>with three cheers: ''The Federal Constitution: may
</p>
<p>the eagle of America convey it to the remotest parts
</p>
<p>of the globe ; and whilst they read they can but admire."
</p>
<p>A third : *'The memory of the illustrious Washington,
</p>
<p>father of America : may his guardian spirit still watch
</p>
<p>over us and prove a terror to the engines of tyranny."
</p>
<p>In New Orleans they toasted the following sentiment :
</p>
<p>"The ancient boundaries of Louisiana  republics never
</p>
<p>contract their limits." Claiborne was delighted with
</p>
<p>the celebration in his capital.
</p>
<p>"On yesterday," he said to Dearborn in a dispatch of
</p>

<p>destruction of the power which had fettered it. Also
</p>
<p>the Mexican Association, or, more accurately, the
</p>
<p>Mexican Society, of New Orleans was enthusiastic
</p>
<p>in the agitation for war. "It had for its object," said
</p>
<p>Dr. Watkins, Mayor of New Orleans, "collecting in-
</p>
<p>formation relative to the population and force of the
</p>
<p>interior provinces of New Spain which, in the event
</p>
<p>of war, might be useful to the United States." He
</p>
<p>further averred that the invasion of Mexico had always
</p>
<p>been counted upon in a war with the Dons.
</p>
<p>The West, as it loved the Union hated Spain, and
</p>
<p>that hatred appeared to be of a nature which only war
</p>
<p>could appease. The war might be legitimate or other-
</p>
<p>wise  there were those who did not mean to ask ques-
</p>
<p>tions. Perhaps this element and its most extravagant
</p>
<p>plan is represented in the communication published in
</p>
<p>several Western newspapers in the fall of 1805, over
</p>
<p>the signature of "A Kentucky Man" :
</p>
<p>"As to the Spaniards, we can pay ourselves. There
</p>
<p>are gentlemen now in this city from the westward, who
</p>
<p>will make contracts whenever Congress authorizes it to
</p>
<p>pay every just claim of our citizens upon them, and will
</p>
<p>engage to do it, free of any expense to the United States,
</p>
<p>and also, not to injure any private property in Mexico."*
</p>
<p>Evidently nothing less was meditated than the
</p>
<p>overrunning of Mexico, whose public domains or con-
</p>
<p>fiscated public properties would be seized for debts
</p>
<p>long overdue! The proposition was not so visionary
</p>
<p>as it appeared on its face, and cannot be overlooked

<p>114 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>in casting up the sum total of ideas which were eddy-
</p>
<p>ing in the West.
</p>
<p>In the midst of the war excitement, in the winter
</p>
<p>of 1805, Francisco de Miranda, a native of Caracas,
</p>
<p>landed in New York. As early as 1793 he had tried
</p>
<p>to draw the United States and Great Britain into a
</p>
<p>war for the liberation of his native country. Failing
</p>
<p>then, he went to the Continent, where he became a
</p>
<p>distinguished wanderer, taking high rank in the armies
</p>
<p>of both France and Russia. It was truly an auspicious
</p>
<p>time for him to revive his scheme of rebellion in Vene-
</p>
<p>zuela, for war between Spain and the United States
</p>
<p>appeared to be only a matter of days. Finding gener-
</p>
<p>ous friends in New York, he soon had the Leander
</p>
<p>fitted out with arms and provisions, and February 2,
</p>
<p>1806, sailed on his ill-fated voyage.
</p>
<p>The part played by the Government in this affair
</p>
<p>is, to say the least, not above suspicion, for both Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son and Madison knew something of what was going
</p>
<p>on ; but for us what is of most value in this connection
</p>
<p>is to know that the expedition was watched with the
</p>
<p>greatest interest throughout the Union, especially in
</p>
<p>the West. The newspapers of the time were full of
</p>
<p>Miranda, and the tone of the comment was most con-
</p>
<p>vincing. A single paragraph from the Charleston
</p>
<p>Courier, quoted in the Orleans Gazette , will suffice } 
</p>
<p>"The expedition under General Miranda, from a va-
</p>
<p>riety of circumstances, promises to be attended with suc-
</p>
<p>cess. The dissatisfaction of the people generally with the
</p>
<p>Spanish Government, and particularly the priests, who,

</p>
<p>by a late decree of the court of Madrid, are deprived of
</p>
<p>the principal parts of the revenues of the church, will
</p>
<p>induce them to seek a change of masters; to rid them-
</p>
<p>selves at once of the most abject state of slavery and ig-
</p>
<p>norance and from the fiend-like influence of the Prince
</p>
<p>of Peace. . . . What has the Spanish Government to
</p>
<p>oppose him [Miranda] ? Nothing. The provinces are
</p>
<p>without troops, or at least they are not sufficient to drive
</p>
<p>the revolters from their purposes. The mother country
</p>
<p>cannot assist them  she has soldiers but no ships  and
</p>
<p>if the means of transportation were found, the British
</p>
<p>fleet would intercept them. . . . The success of Mi-
</p>
<p>randa will open to the Americans a new field of enter-
</p>
<p>prise ; from the United States they must receive their sup-
</p>
<p>plies of goods and military stores, and the products which
</p>
<p>can be obtained in return will yield a good profit. . . .
</p>
<p>But, we hope, remembering our own emancipation, we
</p>
<p>shall give our aid to those who feel their rights, and
</p>
<p>have courage enough to assert them. . . . May the
</p>
<p>most brilliant success attend the standards of those who
</p>
<p>fight for the cause of rational liberty, and for the dignity
</p>
<p>of the human species."
</p>
<p>Such paragraphs need no discussion, but the fact
</p>
<p>that they were printed and reprinted in every journal
</p>
<p>of the West is worth remarking. Having been thus
</p>
<p>informed of Miranda's enterprise, the Westerners were
</p>
<p>on the alert for any news from Venezuela. All through
</p>
<p>the summer and fall that Burr and his associates were
</p>
<p>struggling to make headway with their expedition the
</p>
<p>newspapers were telling of Miranda's victories, and
</p>
<p>finally of the rumors of his defeat. When the report
</p>
<p>came that he had been beaten off, the West was loath
</p>
<p>to give credence to it, and the disappointment was keen
</p>
<p>when it came positively to be known that he had failed.

<p>There was not in all the West a word of disaffection.
</p>
<p>ii6 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>In their toasts  and toasts were of far greater signifi-
</p>
<p>cance in that day than this  two ideas appear predomi-
</p>
<p>nant : reverence for the Union and hatred for the
</p>
<p>symbols of despotism. Their sympathies, too, for
</p>
<p>Miranda betrayed unconsciously a love for the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution and a growing National spirit which was in
</p>
<p>six short years to force, in spite of the East and New
</p>
<p>England, the second war with Great Britain! And
</p>
<p>yet this was the region advertised as openly rebellious
</p>
<p> the region Yrujo and Merry expected shortly to
</p>
<p>declare its independence. Could ignorance of condi-
</p>
<p>tions have been more dense?
</p>
<p>By the end of June, 1806, there were in the province
</p>
<p>of Texas one thousand and seven soldiers.^ The force
</p>
<p>on the frontier, however, never exceeded six hundred
</p>
<p>and ninety-seven men,^ which was considered strong
</p>
<p>enough to sustain the King's pretensions in that quar-
</p>
<p>ter. Accordingly, in July, a body of troops under
</p>
<p>Viana once more hoisted the flag of Spain at Bayou
</p>
<p>Pierre. August 4th Viana wrote urgently to the com-
</p>
<p>mander of Nacogdoches for provisions, complaining
</p>
<p>that they had been four days without rations.^ The
</p>
<p>straits of the quartermaster were much intensified
</p>
<p>by the arrival of Herrera with several companies of
</p>
<p>cavalry; while sickness spread through the camp, con-
</p>
<p>verting it into a wretched hospital. But the Ameri-
</p>
<p>cans held exaggerated ideas of the efficiency of the
</p>
<p>corps under Cordero and Herrera.

<p>THE CRISIS ON THE FRONTIER 117
</p>
<p>The news of the recrossing of the Sabine by the
</p>
<p>Spaniards spread rapidly through the country, rousing
</p>
<p>the inhabitants to arms  for the hated enemy appeared
</p>
<p>once more as invaders. The Governor of Louisiana
</p>
<p>was at Concordia, near Natchez  having been granted
</p>
<p>a leave of absence to visit his home in Tennessee  when
</p>
<p>the intelHgence reached him. August 17th he met
</p>
<p>Cowles Meade, the Acting-Governor of Mississippi
</p>
<p>Territory, at Natchez, and a joint proclamation was
</p>
<p>issued. The people were called upon to aid the regular
</p>
<p>troops in expelling the Spaniards from Bayou Pierre,
</p>
<p>if the orders of the War Department had not been
</p>
<p>revoked; they were to be put on a campaign footing,
</p>
<p>the militia of the Mississippi Territory being ready to
</p>
<p>march to the frontier or to defend New Orleans, as the
</p>
<p>circumstances might require. The continued absence
</p>
<p>of Wilkinson was remarked and regretted.^ But Clai-
</p>
<p>borne felt he had no time to lose. "Having heard that
</p>
<p>a considerable force of Spaniards [is] in the vicinity of
</p>
<p>Natchitoches," he wrote the same day to Dr. John
</p>
<p>Watkins,^ *'I propose setting out to-morrow for the
</p>
<p>counties of Rapides and Natchitoches, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of putting the militia in the best possible state."
</p>
<p>Before Claiborne had started, a Pinckneyville cor-
</p>
<p>respondent of the Orleans Gazette reported that Lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant Smith had arrived from Natchitoches with
</p>
<p>orders for Colonel Kingsbury to march forward with
</p>
<p>all the troops at Fort Adams. Nine hundred men
</p>
<p>under the Governor of Texas, so the report ran, had

</p>
<p>advanced to within twelve miles of Natchitoches, where
</p>
<p>they were met by a flag from Major Porter, demanding
</p>
<p>an explanation of this new encroachment; to which
</p>
<p>they answered that they meant to reoccupy their for-
</p>
<p>mer positions. An engagement had therefore probably
</p>
<p>taken place, if the Spaniards persisted in their under-
</p>
<p>taking/ The reporter was not aware, however, that
</p>
<p>the commander at Natchitoches was bound by supple-
</p>
<p>mentary instructions from the head of the army, which
</p>
<p>forbade the enforcement of the orders from the Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of War. Wilkinson was already disposing of
</p>
<p>things to suit himself.
</p>
<p>Claiborne entered at once into a sharp controversy
</p>
<p>with Herrera. On the twenty-sixth he complained of
</p>
<p>several acts of unfriendliness  the setting at liberty of
</p>
<p>runaway slaves, the capture of three Americans (Irwin,
</p>
<p>Shaw, and Brewster), and the invasion of the territory
</p>
<p>of the United States. Herrera did not deny the first
</p>
<p>two charges, but returned his demurrer to the third.
</p>
<p>At this juncture he fell ill, and Claiborne courteously
</p>
<p>sent Dr. Hayward to attend him. The Governor, how-
</p>
<p>ever, did not mean to suspend operations  he urged
</p>
<p>the fulfillment of the instructions from Washington,
</p>
<p>which commanded that all foreign troops should be
</p>
<p>driven to the west of the Sabine. Colonel Cushing
</p>
<p>explained that this would be contrary to the mandate
</p>
<p>of Wilkinson; and thereupon the Governor gave vent
</p>
<p>to his suspicions in a letter to Meade: "My present
</p>
<p>impression is that 'all is not right.' I know not whom
</p>
<p>to censure, but it seems to me that there is wrong

</p>
<p>have been pubhshed) ought not to have been issued,
</p>
<p>or they should have been adhered to and supported." ^
</p>
<p>It was, indeed, hard for a layman to understand how
</p>
<p>even a general could set in abeyance the commands
</p>
<p>of his superior ; there zvas wrong somewhere, but this
</p>
<p>was as near as the good-natured, honest Governor ever
</p>
<p>came to its discovery. The day he wrote Meade he
</p>
<p>addressed two letters quite free from suspicions to the
</p>
<p>War Department:
</p>
<p>'The Spanish troops have made a retrograde move-
</p>
<p>ment," he reported August 28th ;'^ "they have advanced
</p>
<p>their main body to within seventeen miles of Natchi-
</p>
<p>toches, and their patrols as far as the Bayou Funda [Ar-
</p>
<p>royo Hondo], to which place it is contended the province
</p>
<p>of Texas extends (this bayou is about seven miles from
</p>
<p>Natchitoches) ; but within these few days past they have
</p>
<p>fallen back to the settlement of Bayou Pierre, about fifty
</p>
<p>or sixty miles distant from Natchitoches. Their num-
</p>
<p>bers are conjectured to be 1,000, the greater part cavalry,
</p>
<p>and reinforcements are daily expected. They are amply
</p>
<p>supplied with beef cattle, but it is said a scarcity of bread
</p>
<p>is experienced. ... I have found the Americans, who
</p>
<p>are settled in the frontier counties, devoted to their
</p>
<p>country, and solicitous to be called into service."
</p>
<p>The second letter, a week later, recounted as current
</p>
<p>report that the Spaniards at Bayou Pierre numbered
</p>
<p>1200; that the Governor of Texas was approaching
</p>
<p>with three hundred regulars ; that two regiments from
</p>
<p>Vera Cruz were to land at the mouth of the Trinity;

<p>and that the Viceroy and the Council of Mexico were

<p>of Spain having no part in it. It was mentioned that
</p>
<p>Colonel Cushing was restrained from acting on the
</p>
<p>offensive by Wilkinson's commands; that the Colonel
</p>
<p>in the meantime was making arrangements to take the
</p>
<p>field, while he (Claiborne) was preparing the militia/
</p>
<p>After his experiences in the administration of the
</p>
<p>municipality of New Orleans, where he found only
</p>
<p>antagonisms and imbittered factions, political and
</p>
<p>social, it gave him extreme pleasure, as he wrote Cush-
</p>
<p>ing, to note the enthusiasm of the people.^ The una-
</p>
<p>nimity with which they responded to the defense of the
</p>
<p>country was certainly gratifying to him and to those
</p>
<p>in the high places of the Government, who were in daily
</p>
<p>expectation of the herald of war.
</p>
<p>The Cabinet early resigned itself to the situation.
</p>
<p>When the news of the expulsion of Gonzales reached
</p>
<p>Washington a meeting was held, the result of which
</p>
<p>the President reported to Dearborn, who was absent : 
</p>
<p>"Six war vessels are to be kept before New Orleans,"
</p>
<p>ran the note ; "three in Lake Pontchartrain. Blockhouses
</p>
<p>and other defenses are to be erected at suitable places on
</p>
<p>the defiles of New Orleans. The troops are to remain
</p>
<p>off the island on account of their health, but they are to

<p>be ready to march at notice. The militia of New Orleans,

<p>Tombigbee, and Natchez are to be put in the best pos-
</p>
<p>sible condition ; those at New Orleans to defend that

<p>city; those on the Tombigbee to seize Mobile or Pensa-

</p>
<p>state of mind of the Government is clearly reflected
</p>
<p>therein. If anything was left in doubt, this was shortly
</p>
<p>removed by the Executive. May 6, 1806, when the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing orders went forward to General Wilkinson, the
</p>
<p>challenge was accepted, and it was for the administra-
</p>
<p>tors of Don Carlos in the New World to say whether
</p>
<p>the Floridas, Louisiana, Texas, and the Spanish
</p>
<p>Americas should become legitimate stakes of war.
</p>
<p>"From recent information received from New Orleans
</p>
<p>and its vicinity," wrote the Secretary of War to General
</p>
<p>Wilkinson/ ''the hostile views of the officers of his Cath-
</p>
<p>olic Majesty in that quarter have been so evident as to
</p>
<p>require the strictest precaution on the part of the United
</p>
<p>States ; and the immediate exertion of the means we pos-
</p>
<p>sess for securing the rightful possession of the territory
</p>
<p>of the United States, and for protecting the citizens and
</p>
<p>their property from the hostile encroachments of our
</p>
<p>neighbours, the Spaniards. You will, therefore, with as
</p>
<p>little delay as practicable, repair to the Territory of Or-
</p>
<p>1 ans or its vicinity, and take upon yourself the command
</p>
<p>of the troops in that quarter, together with such militia or
</p>
<p>volunteers as may turn out for the defense of the country.
</p>
<p>And you will, by all the means in your power, repel any
</p>
<p>invasion of the territory of the United States east of the
</p>
<p>River Sabine, or north or west of the bounds of what
</p>
<p>has been called West Florida."
</p>
<p>There could be no mistaking the meaning of these
</p>
<p>orders; they were explicit and final. Though it was
</p>
<p>true "every day increased our prospects of war," as the
</p>
<p>General wrote, he was detained in St. Louis for three
</p>
<p>months by "various and unavoidable obstacles." What
</p>
<p>these distressing impediments were we are left to sur-
</p>

<p>himself on the one side and Major Bruff and Colonel
</p>
<p>Hammond on the other offers no explanation.^ He
</p>
<p>wrote John Smith very soon after the receipt of the
</p>
<p>dispatch of May 6th: "I shall obey the military man-
</p>
<p>date, for there I look for fame and honor."'' He was
</p>
<p>therefore apparently eager to proceed. Why the delay ?
</p>
<p>Is it not possible that Clark gave us the key when he
</p>
<p>said that the General wrote Burr, "I shall be ready
</p>
<p>before you" ? His procrastination was deliberate, and
</p>
<p>could have been for no other purpose than to await the
</p>
<p>development of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson landed in Natchez the night of Sep-
</p>
<p>tember 7th, and the next day outlined his programme
</p>
<p>to Dearborn : **I shall drain the cup of conciliation to
</p>
<p>maintain the peace of our country," he vaunted ; but in
</p>
<p>the preceding paragraph he had remarked that he hoped
</p>
<p>the Spaniards would remain at Bayou Pierre until he
</p>
<p>arrived, and he had taken occasion to say that both
</p>
<p>Meade and Claiborne favored expelling the enemy alto-
</p>
<p>gether, not leaving them so much as a guard at Bayou
</p>
<p>Pierre.
</p>
<p>'^Governor Claiborne has, I understand, arrayed the
</p>
<p>militia in the western counties of the Territory of

<p>THE CRISIS ON THE FRONTIER 123
</p>
<p>up, I shall endeavor to procure about four or five hun-
</p>
<p>dred dragoons and mounted militia from the two terri-
</p>
<p>tories. ... A blow once struck, it would appear
</p>
<p>expedient that we should make every advantage of it ; and
</p>
<p>if men and means are furnished I will soon plant our
</p>
<p>standards on the left bank of Grand River."
</p>
<p>The "designs of the Spaniard" must have been
</p>
<p>seen at a glance, for at no moment was the march
</p>
<p>of the militia discouraged. Moreover, to have spoken
</p>
<p>of designs was deliberate and calculated to work on the
</p>
<p>fears of the Government ; he had assumed the extraor-
</p>
<p>dinary role he was to play to the end. While inditing
</p>
<p>this to Dearborn he was making arrangements with
</p>
<p>Governor Meade for the volunteers of Mississippi Ter-
</p>
<p>ritory to join him, and giving orders for the strength-
</p>
<p>ening of various posts. Pointe Coupee was to be re-
</p>
<p>enforced with seventy-five men, which number, with a
</p>
<p>detachment of militia, he thought sufficient to capture
</p>
<p>the Spanish Governor, Grand Pre, with his garrison in
</p>
<p>Baton Rouge. Two hundred militia were to be added
</p>
<p>to the force on the Tombigbee, and the commander was
</p>
<p>to be ready to invest Mobile, while another body was
</p>
<p>to make a feint on Pensacola to prevent reenforcements
</p>
<p>being sent to the former. These instructions given,
</p>
<p>Wilkinson started for the front via Rapides on the Red
</p>
<p>River, at which place Claiborne awaited him. On the
</p>
<p>nineteenth the General appeared. He then addressed
</p>
<p>the Governor, discussing the menacing attitude of
</p>
<p>Spain, and advising the issuance of a proclamation
</p>
<p>interdicting intercourse between the contending parties,
</p>
<p>save as regulated under passports. He argued that this

</p>
<p>was warranted because of the vigorous policy pursued
</p>
<p>124 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>by the enemy in permitting no one to pass to Nacog-
</p>
<p>doches unless known to be attached to Spain. Through
</p>
<p>this system of intercourse they were advised of all our
</p>
<p>plans, while we remained ignorant of theirs. Next he
</p>
<p>asked for the troops in New Orleans and every militia-
</p>
<p>man to be spared, and he wanted them to assemble at
</p>
<p>Natchitoches early in October.^ Claiborne replied the
</p>
<p>same day that he could not issue the proclamation for
</p>
<p>fear of retaliatory measures being pursued by West
</p>
<p>Florida ; the same effect, he thought, might be produced
</p>
<p>by prohibiting communications through Natchitoches,
</p>
<p>the only open route. Wilkinson could close this by
</p>
<p>issuing an order to prevent the passage of provisions
</p>
<p>to the Spaniards. As to the militia, the Governor
</p>
<p>promised a force of four hundred ; the rest, because of
</p>
<p>the nature of the country to be defended, were to be
</p>
<p>reserved for emergencies.^ Claiborne's steps had been
</p>
<p>taken with a view to war, and he urged upon the Gen-
</p>
<p>eral that "no time ought to be lost in preparing to vin-
</p>
<p>dicate the national rights."
</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the rural districts thought like-
</p>
<p>wise. They came with such alacrity that in one in-
</p>
<p>stance a call for one hundred volunteers was answered
</p>
<p>by two hundred and fifteen. October 3d was the day
</p>
<p>appointed for the general rendezvous at Natchitoches,
</p>
<p>the headquarters of the American army, which place
</p>
<p>Wilkinson reached September 22d, two weeks having
</p>
<p>been spent on a journey accomplished in three days and
</p>
<p>a half on his return. If Claiborne and the people were

</p>
<p>chafing under delay and were eager to drive back the
</p>
<p>Dons, the commander of the army was still moving
</p>
<p>leisurely. The day Wilkinson left Rapides the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor started for New Orleans, and the evening of
</p>
<p>October 6th reentered his capital, where things were in
</p>
<p>a stir of excitement. The news that war was im-
</p>
<p>pending was hailed with enthusiasm. The Orleans
</p>
<p>Gazette, the leading journal of the city and the mouth-
</p>
<p>piece of the Americans, came out in a long article,
</p>
<p>which, after having announced that General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>had gone to the frontier, gave vent to pure revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary sentiment : 
</p>
<p>"We are happy to learn that the Government has at
</p>
<p>length issued positive orders to repel the aggressions of
</p>
<p>our enemies by force. We have indeed suffered from
</p>
<p>them, almost beyond human endurance. Their intrigues
</p>
<p>to disturb the repose of this country ; their maintaining
</p>
<p>possession of our territory between the Mississippi and
</p>
<p>Perdido for upwards of two years ; their outrageous con-
</p>
<p>duct towards our citizens on the banks of the Tombig-
</p>
<p>bee ;  these and a thousand other injuries and insults de-
</p>
<p>mand instant redress. ... If the enemy be forced to re-
</p>
<p>cross the Sabine, he must be driven still farther ; for it
</p>
<p>would be idle to suffer him to remain there quietly until he
</p>
<p>received reinforcements from the Southern provinces,
</p>
<p>which could easily be furnished him, inasmuch as the route
</p>
<p>from Natchitoches to Mexico is clear, plain, and open ; and
</p>
<p>the country through which it passes well stored with cattle
</p>
<p>and forage. How it may be proper to pursue the enemy
</p>
<p>is a question of policy for our Government to decide. On
</p>
<p>this we may sincerely rely that our President, who had
</p>
<p>so large a share in accomplishing the independence of the
</p>
<p>United States, will seize with eagerness and exultation
</p>
<p>an honorable occasion that may offer for conferring on

<p>126 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>. . . Gallant Louisianians ! now is the time to distin-
</p>
<p>guish yourselves. . . . Should the generous efforts
</p>
<p>of our Government to establish a free, independent repub-
</p>
<p>lican empire in Mexico be successful, how fortunate, how
</p>
<p>enviable would be the situation in New Orleans! The
</p>
<p>deposit at once of the countless treasures of the South, and
</p>
<p>the inexhaustible fertility of the Western States, we
</p>
<p>would soon rival and outshine the most opulent cities of
</p>
<p>the world/"
</p>
<p>This language seems none the less remarkable when
</p>
<p>we know that it came from the pen of Editor Bradford,
</p>
<p>who, a few weeks later, was throttled by Wilkinson on
</p>
<p>a charge of misprision of treason against the United
</p>
<p>States. He was a coadjutor of Burr, to whose enter-
</p>
<p>prise he doubtless referred when he wrote that the
</p>
<p>President would seize with eagerness and exultation an
</p>
<p>honorable occasion "for conferring on our oppressed
</p>
<p>Spanish brethren in Mexico those inestimable blessings
</p>
<p>of freedom which we ourselves enjoy." The document
</p>
<p>truly exhibits the underlying motives in all great
</p>
<p>revolutionary movements  the vindication of rights,
</p>
<p>the freeing of oppressed peoples, and finally the mate-
</p>
<p>rial reward. If war with Spain was avoided for almost
</p>
<p>a century, it was not for lack of moral support that it
</p>
<p>failed in 1806; nor does this admission do justice to
</p>
<p>the revolutionary audience that applauded the senti-
</p>
<p>ments uttered by the Orleans Gazette, nor to the men
</p>
<p>who hurried to arms at the call of danger.
</p>
<p>From Fort Adams and Natchez came the news that
</p>
<p>every preparation was being made to repel the Spanish
</p>
<p>encroachments, and that all the regular troops had

<p>^Orleans Gazette, September 23, 1806,
</p>
<p>THE CRISIS ON THE FRONTIER 127
</p>
<p>marched under Captain Sparks for Natchitoches.
</p>
<p>Major Ferdinand L. Claiborne was expected to pass
</p>
<p>toward the frontier at any hour at the head of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi miHtia and Captain Farrar's dragoons/
</p>
<p>October 8th Claiborne informed the Secretary of War
</p>
<p>that the miHtia from the frontier counties, more than
</p>
<p>five hundred strong, had reported at Natchitoches, and
</p>
<p>that a detachment of one hundred regulars with miH-
</p>
<p>tary stores would set out in a few days from New
</p>
<p>Orleans.^ Thus the American Army in the West
</p>
<p>rapidly concentrated at the old French trading post.
</p>
<p>The temper of the volunteers was no longer questioned.
</p>
<p>Claiborne wrote Dearborn on the twelfth that he was
</p>
<p>surprised at the readiness with which the ancient Lou-
</p>
<p>isianians took up arms. He conveyed also the intelli-
</p>
<p>gence that Wilkinson had written in his last letter
</p>
<p>(dated September 25th) that unless his orders were
</p>
<p>countermanded he "would soon have a meeting with
</p>
<p>the Spaniards."' It looked as though the fate of the
</p>
<p>nation as to peace or war hung on Wilkinson's word.
</p>
<p>This was the war which was to have called Burr's
</p>
<p>expedition into open array. Senator Adair avowed
</p>
<p>that "on this war taking place he [Burr] calculated
</p>
<p>with certainty, as well from the policy of the measure
</p>
<p>at the time, as from the positive assurances of Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, who seemed to have the power to force it in his
</p>
<p>hands."* Wilkinson had gone further in his confidence
</p>
<p>with Adair, and, after the failure of the conspiracy,

<p>Letter of General Adair, dated Washington City, March 4,
</p>
<p>-1-
</p>
<p>128 THE AARON BURR CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>attempted to disparage his character, accusing the Ken-
</p>
<p>tuckian of having gone to New Orleans in the fall of
</p>
<p>1806 in the "dark." ^ Adair retaliated, quoting from
</p>
<p>the General's letters. In answer to a question in Adair's
</p>
<p>correspondence of January 27th  'Tray how far is it,
</p>
<p>and what kind of way from St. Louis to Santa Fe, and
</p>
<p>from thence to Mexico?" ^  Wilkinson wrote:
</p>
<p>''Do you ktiow that I have reserved these places for
</p>
<p>my own triumphal entry, that I have been reconnoitering
</p>
<p>and exploring the route for sixteen years ; that I not only
</p>
<p>know the way, but all the difficulties and how to surmount
</p>
<p>them? I wish we could get leave, Mexico would soon
</p>
<p>be ours."
</p>
<p>More significant is his letter of September 28th
</p>
<p>from Natchitoches, in which Adair was assured that
</p>
<p>within six or eight days the sword would be drawn :
</p>
<p>"The time long looked for by many and wished for
</p>
<p>by more, has now arrived for subverting the Spanish
</p>
<p>government in Mexico. Be you ready and join me; we
</p>
<p>will want little more than light-armed troops with a few
</p>
<p>More will be done by marching than fighting;
</p>
<p>5,000 men will give us to Rio ; 10,000 to ;
</p>
<p>we must here divide our army into three parts and will
</p>
<p>then require 30,000 men to conquer the whole of the prov-
</p>
<p>inces of Mexico. We cannot fail of success."^

<p>Adair challenged the President to look into Wilkin-
