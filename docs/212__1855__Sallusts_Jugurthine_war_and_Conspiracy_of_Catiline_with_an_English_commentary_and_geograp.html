<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>In preparing a new edition of Sallust tor the press,
</p>
<p>the editor has taken the greatest care to make such
</p>
<p>alterations and improvements, in the work, as may
</p>
<p>render it a still more useful guide to the student than
</p>
<p>its predecessors have proved. The principal changes
</p>
<p>will be found to consist in a more enlarged commentary
</p>
<p>on the Jugurthine war,in the placing of this production
</p>
<p>of Sallust's before the narrative of the conspiracy of
</p>
<p>Catiline, and in the two Indexes, the one Geographical,
</p>
<p>the other Historical, which have been appended to the
</p>
<p>work, The enlargement of the notes on the Jugurthine
</p>
<p>war has been made at the request of several instructors,
</p>
<p>who thought that a more ample commentary on this
</p>
<p>part of the historian's labours was needed by their
</p>
<p>pupils. The change introduced into the body of the
</p>
<p>work-, by placing the narrative of the war with Jugurtha
</p>
<p>before the account of Catiline's conspiracy, cannot but

</p>
<p>acquaintance with Roman literature, or even with Ro-
</p>
<p>man history. The old arrangement violates the order
</p>
<p>of time, since the attempt of Catiline to overthrow the
</p>
<p>government of his country was subsequent to the war
</p>
<p>with Jugurtha by a period of nearly fifty years. The
</p>
<p>impression produced, therefore, on the mind of the
</p>
<p>student, from his being required to read the two works
</p>
<p>in an inverted order, must, of necessity, be a confused
</p>
<p>one. In the account of Catiline's conspiracy, for ex-
</p>
<p>ample, he will find frequent allusions to the calamitous
</p>
<p>consequences of Sylla's strife with Marius, and will see
</p>
<p>many of the profligate partisans of the former rallying
</p>
<p>around the standard of Catiline ; while, in the history
</p>
<p>of the Jugurthine war, if he be made to peruse it after
</p>
<p>the other, in the ordinary routine of school-reading, he
</p>
<p>will be introduced to the same Sylla, just entering on
</p>
<p>a public career, and standing high in the favour and
</p>
<p>confidence of Marius ! How, too, will he be able to
</p>
<p>appreciate, in their full force, the remarks of Sallust re-
</p>
<p>lative to the successive changes in the Roman form of
</p>
<p>government, and the alternate ascendency of the aristo-
</p>
<p>cratic and popular parties, if he be called upon to direct
</p>
<p>his attention to results before he is made acquainted
</p>
<p>with the causes that produced them ? The only argu
</p>
<p>ment adduced in favour of the old arrangement is, that
</p>
<p>Sallust composed the narrative of Catiline's conspiracy
</p>
<p>before that of the Jugurthine war, and that all the

</p>
<p>TREFACE. *
</p>
<p>follow this same order, and place the account of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy first. Such an argument, however, if it be
</p>
<p>really deserving of the name, must w r eigh but little
</p>
<p>when positive utility is placed in the opposite scale.
</p>
<p>The order, moreover, for which we contend, is no nov-
</p>
<p>elty on the continent of Europe, as may be seen from
</p>
<p>the works of the President De Brosses, the Abbe
</p>
<p>Cassagne, and M. Du Rozoir. The last mentioned
</p>
<p>editor, indeed, expresses his very great surprise that
</p>
<p>the arrangement in question has not by this time be
</p>
<p><ome a general one.
</p>
<p>With regard to the Indexes that have been added to
</p>
<p>the w r ork, it may be sufficient to remark, that the object,
</p>
<p>in preparing them, was to relieve the commentary from
</p>
<p>what might have proved too heavy a pressure of mate-
</p>
<p>rials, and have deterred from, rather than invited, a pe-
</p>
<p>rusal. The geographical and historical matter, w T ith a
</p>
<p>very few slight exceptions, now stands by itself, and
</p>
<p>may be consulted with more convenience, and it is
</p>
<p>hoped, with more decided advantage.
</p>
<p>The biographical account of Sallust, and the sketch
</p>
<p>of his writings, w r hich have been given in the previous
</p>
<p>editions under the ordinary form, now assume the char-
</p>
<p>acter of an imaginary conversation, a mode of impart
</p>
<p>ing information which the editor has recently adopted
</p>
<p>in a course of College-Lectures on Ancient Literature
</p>
<p>and which he has found to be extremely well calculated

</p>
<p>In conclusion, the editor feels, that it would be the
</p>
<p>worst species of affectation in him, were he to conceal
</p>
<p>the pleasure he has experienced, at the very favourable
</p>
<p>reception which has been given to the previous editions
</p>
<p>of this work. And he thinks he may be allowed to
</p>
<p>state, with pardonable pride, that two separate re-prints,
</p>
<p>by different editors, total strangers to himselt, have also
</p>
<p>appeared in England, and that too without any effort

<p>LIFE AND WRITINGS OF SALLUST.
</p>
<p>DR. BARTON-HENRY ARLINGTON.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Well, Henry, how are you pleased with Oxford 1  I have
</p>
<p>met you several times since your arrival among us, but have never be-
</p>
<p>fore this had an opportunity of conversing with you, or of ascertaining
</p>
<p>how you liked your new residence.
</p>
<p>H. T am delighted with it, my dear Doctor, and feel like a new being
</p>
<p>amid these classic shades. With the means of improvement now full}
</p>
<p>under my own control, I am determined to make that use of my time,
</p>
<p>which shall lead in after life, with the divine blessing, to permanent and
</p>
<p>honourable distinction. My reading begins, in fact, to assume a new
</p>
<p>character, and my attention is more and more directed every day to
</p>
<p>works of solid utility. It is with this view, mdeed, that I have sought
</p>
<p>you on the present occasion, as I have just entered on a course of Roman
</p>
<p>literature, and wish to consult you about the merits of a writer, in rela-
</p>
<p>tion to whom, I am, I confess, in a good deal of doubt  I mean the his-
</p>
<p>torian Sallust.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. I can easily conceive. Henry, that an ardent admirer like
</p>
<p>yourself of the character and services of a Cicero, would be inclined to
</p>
<p>regard the cold applause, which Sallust bestows upon the saviour of his
</p>
<p>country, in the light of a defect, and even stain upon bis escutcheon
</p>
<p>as an historian. Nor will I stand forth to defend him. Something,
</p>
<p>however, must be conceded to the rankling of private animosity, and
</p>
<p>something to disgust at the ill-disguised and inordinate vanity of the
</p>
<p>Roman consul. For, after all, Henry, what is history 1 A mere place
</p>
<p>of exhibition, where the spectators are too little acquainted with the
</p>
<p>hidden causes of what they behold, and the actors are too dir^tly inter-
</p>
<p>ested in the result, to enable us to depend, with any degree of certainty.
</p>
<p>on the accounts of either the one or the other !
</p>
<p>H. Your remaik is a very just one, my dear Doctor, and ought to
</p>
<p>teach us the utter uncertainty of this species of knowledge, except
</p>
<p>where it bears the impress from on high. History, in the former case,
</p>
<p>may be likened to the arid plains of Egypt, where the half- buried tens** 1 *.

<p>and half-deciphered inscription, tell the tale of other days, but tell it in
</p>
<p>dark and mysterious language ; while, in the latter, she stands like the
</p>
<p>pyramids of that same Eastern land, alone in the midst of ruins, resting
</p>
<p>securely on the rock of ages, and pointing upward to the skies.  But I
</p>
<p>am wandering from my subject. Would it be too great an encroachment
</p>
<p>on your valuable time, Doctor, were I to ask for a brief sketch of the life
</p>
<p>of the historian 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Not at all, Henry. I am perfectly at leisure, and will accede
</p>
<p>to your request with the utmost readiness. Should any thing, however,
</p>
<p>strike you in the course of my remarks, as being either at variance with
</p>
<p>your pre-conceived notions, or savouring too much of mere speculation,
</p>
<p>you will oblige me by a candid communication of your sentiments.
</p>
<p>H. There will be very little occasion for this, my dear Doctor, as I
</p>
<p>am a mere novice in matters of literary history, and am come prepared
</p>
<p>to listen rather than to oppose. I will avail myself, however, of your
</p>
<p>very kind offer, to ask an occasional question or tw r o, should any thing
</p>
<p>appear to me either novel or obscure.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Well then, to begin with the name itself, the German scholars^
</p>
<p>whose research nothing can escape, are divided in opinion as to the pro-
</p>
<p>priety of writing Sallustius or Salustius, and Crispus Sallustius or
</p>
<p>Sallustius Crispus. 1 I believe it will be found, upon an examination of
</p>
<p>authorities, that Sallustius is the more correct form, and Crispus Sal-
</p>
<p>lustius the more usual arrangement of the manuscripts. It would seem,
</p>
<p>however, that, in the golden age of Latin literature, it was customary to
</p>
<p>place the cognomen after the nomen, and in the silver age to reverse this
</p>
<p>order. 2  But let us proceed to the historian himself. Sallust was born
</p>
<p>at Amiternum, a town of the Sabines, B. C. 86, or A. U. C. 668. He
</p>
<p>received his education at Rome, and, in his early youth, appears to have
</p>
<p>been desirous of devoting himself to literary pursuits. 
</p>
<p>H Allow me to interrupt you, my dear Doctor, and to ask whether
</p>
<p>it be not a very remarkable circumstance, that so many of the Latin
</p>
<p>writers were natives, not of the capital, but of the provinces, of Italy ?
</p>
<p>Dr. B. The most careless inquirer, Henry, into the literary history
</p>
<p>of Rome, cannot but be struck by the singular fact, that so many of the

<p>distinguished individuals who grace the literary annals of the empire-city,
</p>
<p>were corn, not in Rome itself, but either in foreign lands, or in the prov
</p>
<p>inces of the Italian peninsula. Had the queen of nations adhered in
</p>
<p>.ater days to the selfish and exclusive policy, by which all who were not

<p>oorn within her walls were at first debarred from the full enjoyment of

<p>rtie privileges of citizenship, how few of the great names that now adom
</p>
<p>the history of hor literature could have been claimed by her as her own.
</p>
<p>Livius Andronicus, for example, was a slate from Magna Giaecia;
</p>
<p>Ennius was a native of the same quarter of Italy ; Naevius was a Cam-
</p>
<p>panian ; Plautus came from Umbria ; Pacuvius was born at Brundisiurn,
</p>
<p>Terence at Carthage, Catullus at Verona, Cicero at Arpinum, Virgil at
</p>
<p>Andes, Propertius in Umbria, Horace in Apulia, Livy at Patavium, Ovid
</p>
<p>at Sulmo, Lucan in Spain, the elder Pliny at Verona, and Tacitus at the
</p>
<p>Umbrian city of Interamna.  You see then, Henry, that Rome may be
</p>
<p>said to have acquired her literary, as she did her martial, fame, by the
</p>
<p>exertions of her allies, the provincials of Italy.
</p>
<p>H. Yes, Doctor, and it is only transferring to the operations of intel-
</p>
<p>lect the old proverb about the Marsi, that there was no triumph either
</p>
<p>Over them Or without them ; ovrs Kara Malawi/, ovrs avsv Mapow, ycveaOat
</p>
<p>BpianftovA  But let us return to Sallust.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Notwithstanding his early zeal for literary pursuits, our his-
</p>
<p>torian appears to have been soon involved in that striving after military
</p>
<p>or political distinction, which formed so conspicuous a feature of the age
</p>
<p>in which he lived. We find him, accordingly, at twenty-seven, filling
</p>
<p>the office of quaestor, which entitled him, of course, to a seat in the
</p>
<p>senate, and, about six years afterwards, elected to the important post of
</p>
<p>tribune of the commons. While discharging the duties of this magis-
</p>
<p>tracy, he attached himself to the rising fortunes of Julius Caesar, and,
</p>
<p>during its continuance also, he conducted, along with one of his col-
</p>
<p>leagues, the prosecution against Milo for the murder of Clodius.  Thus
</p>
<p>far all seems to have gone well with Sallust. In the year of Rome, how-
</p>
<p>ever, 704, or 50 B. C, he was excluded from the senate, by the censors
</p>
<p>Appius Claudius Pulcher and Lucius Piso, for an act of gross im-
</p>
<p>morality.2
</p>
<p>H. You surprise me, Dr. Barton.  Sallust, wnose writings breathe
</p>
<p>so lofty an air of rigid morality.  Sallust, the stern declaimer against
</p>
<p>luxury and all its train of attendant vices  a votary at the shrine of licen-
</p>
<p>tiousness and profligacy 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. The most suspicious kind of morality, my young friend, is

<p>undoubtedly that noisy species, which is so fond of descanting on the
</p>
<p>failings and delinquencies of others. Sallust, aye, and even Seneca
</p>
<p>too, notwithstanding the eulogiums of Diderot upon the latter, 3 remind
</p>
<p>me very strongly, when regarded as moralists, of Dr. Johnson's remark,

<p>sither of them carried into fair and successful operation the moral theories
</p>
<p>which they were so anxious to promulgate.  And yet, although Sallust
</p>
<p>was confessedly a man of loose and corrupt principles, it is far from
</p>
<p>being certain that he was the monster of iniquity which some have been
</p>
<p>pleased to represent him. In the case at present under consideration, it
</p>
<p>is more than probable that he owed his exclusion from the senate to the
</p>
<p>violence of the patrician party, to which he was warmly opposed. The
</p>
<p>female, whose name is connected with this disgraceful affair was Fausta,
</p>
<p>the daughter of Sylla, and wife of Milo, and the injured husband is said
</p>
<p>to have caused the offender to be scourged by his slaves. * Now, as
</p>
<p>Fausta was not more remarkable for her personal attractions than for
</p>
<p>jtter want of character, it seems rather extraordinary that, at a time
</p>
<p>when the corruption of manners had almost reached its maximum, the
</p>
<p>intimacy of a Roman senator with so abandoned a female should be
</p>
<p>deemed worthy of so severe a punishment as expulsion from his order.
</p>
<p>I cannot but think, therefore, that Sallust was sacrificed to the party
</p>
<p>spirit which agitated, and in fact divided, the republic. The prosecution
</p>
<p>against Milo, as has already been remarked, took place the same year
</p>
<p>that Sallust was tribune of the commons ; and the latter, who was a de-
</p>
<p>voted partisan of Caesar, had found means to defeat the plans of Cicero
</p>
<p>and the republican party, and procure the condemnation of Milo. Now the
</p>
<p>censor Appius Pulcher was seeking, it appears, the friendship of Cicero,
</p>
<p>whose aid was necessary to his projects, and it would seem that, in order
</p>
<p>to propitiate the good will of the orator, and other individuals of the party
</p>
<p>of Pompey, he ventured upon a decisive step against Sallust, which he
</p>
<p>sought to hide beneath the specious pretext of a regard for public morals.'*
</p>
<p>What think you of this theory, Henry Arlington 1
</p>
<p>H. I am strongly inclined to adopt it, my dear Doctor, since, admit-
</p>
<p>ting it to be true, we may, without regarding Sallust as at all more vir-
</p>
<p>tuous than the great body of his contemporaries, be enabled to shield
</p>
<p>him, by this means, from the virulent abuse of Pompey's freedman Lenaeus,
</p>
<p>whose work should rather be called a frantic satire than an historical
</p>
<p>document. 3  But proceed, if you please, with the life of the Roman.

<p>a snare eventually in the expedition to Africa, where the scattered rem-
</p>
<p>nants of Pompey;s party had rallied under the banners of Scipio and
</p>
<p>Juba. When this region was subdued, he was left by Caesar as praetor
</p>
<p>of Numidia ; and, about the same time, he married Terentia, the di-
</p>
<p>vorced wife of Cicero. i
</p>
<p>H. What a blessing it must have been, Dr. Barton, to have lived un-
</p>
<p>der so virtuous a governor.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. If Dio Cassius speak the truth, Henry, I would rather be ex-
</p>
<p>cused from being governed by such a praetor as Sallust. The historian
</p>
<p>gives a sorry picture of his administration in Africa, charging him with
</p>
<p>flagrant extortion, and with the open despoiling of his province. Caesar
</p>
<p>he says, assigned this region unto him, " to govern it in appearance, but
</p>
<p>to plunder it in reality," Adyco plv ap^eiv, epyw cl ayciv te kclI <pEpLv s-irpe-
</p>
<p>ipev. 2 And he seems, according to Dio's statement, to have been by no
</p>
<p>means backward in fulfilling Caesar's expectations ; for, to borrow another
</p>
<p>phrase from Dio, he did not put in practice what he wrote, ovk enipfjaaro

</p>

</p>
<p>H. You succeeded so well a moment ago, Doctor, in defending Sal-
</p>
<p>lust from another charge, that I wish you would again become his advo-
</p>
<p>cate on the present occasion. Is there nothing that can be urged in hi"
</p>
<p>behalf?
</p>
<p>Dr. B. It would not require much skill, Henry, to make out a very
</p>
<p>plausible case in favour of Sallust, and that too on grounds merely of a
</p>
<p>probable nature. For it is difficult to conceive, hew such conduct, as is
</p>
<p>alleged against him, can be in any way reconciled with the principles
</p>
<p>professed by him in his writings, or how a man so deeply guilty, as his
</p>
<p>enemies made him to be, could have publicly affected such rigid morali
</p>
<p>ty, without outraging, in the most shameless manner, the feelings of all
</p>
<p>his contemporaries. We are tempted to believe, therefore, that Dio Cas-
</p>
<p>sius, and the writers who, after him, have repeated these discreditable
</p>
<p>stories, were led astray by the declamations of the numerous enemies oi

<p>XIV LIFE AND WRITINGS OF SALLUST.
</p>
<p>H. I would like to decide, Doctor, in favour of Sallust, but I feel
</p>
<p>myself bound in candour to pronounce an opinion against him. The
</p>
<p>arguments, just adduced in his favour, are, to say the best of them, more
</p>
<p>imposing than solid, and the hypothesis which you were kind enough to
</p>
<p>mention is too absurd to require a serious refutation.  But what was the
</p>
<p>fate of Sallust under this charge of extortion and spoliation 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. It was such as might have been expected in the peculiar
</p>
<p>complexion of the times. He was acquitted by Caesar, his all-pow-
</p>
<p>erful protector.  After the expiration of his government, Sallust re-
</p>
<p>nounced all public employments, and betook himself to a luxurious re-
</p>
<p>tirement, with his, as I fear you will term it, ill-gotten wealth. He
</p>
<p>chose for his favourite retreats, a villa at Tibur, which had belonged to
</p>
<p>Caesar, and a magnificent palace, which he built in the suburbs of Rome,
</p>
<p>surrounded by delightful pleasure-grounds, afterwards well known and
</p>
<p>celebrated by the name of the Gardens of Sallust. Possessed of every
</p>
<p>attraction, the Sallustian palace and gardens became, after the death
</p>
<p>of their original proprietor, the residence of successive emperors. Au-
</p>
<p>gustus chose them as the scene of his most sumptuous entertainments.
</p>
<p>The taste of Vespasian preferred them to the palace of the Caesars.
</p>
<p>Even the virtuous Nerva, and stern Aurelian, were so attracted by then
</p>
<p>beauty, that, while at Rome, they made them their constant abode. 1  In
</p>
<p>these gardens, or in his villa at Tibur, Sallust passed the concluding years
</p>
<p>of his life, dividing his time between literary avocations and the society
</p>
<p>of his friends, among whom he numbered Lucullus, Messala, and Corne-
</p>
<p>lius Nepos.
</p>
<p>H. But, my dear Doctor, if such were Sallust's friends, and such his
</p>
<p>favourite studies, how is it possible that ho could have indulged in that
</p>
<p>excessive libertinism which has been so often imputed to him 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Your question, Henry, is very well put, and certainly does not
</p>
<p>admit of an easy answer. I think it more than probable, therefore, that
</p>
<p>the historian has been here confounded with the dissolute individual of
</p>
<p>the same name whom Horace mentions in the first book of his satires.
</p>
<p>For my own part, I do not doubt, as I have already remarked, but tha*
</p>
<p>our author was a man of loose morals, and that he rapaciously plun-

</p>
<p>dered his province, like most Roman governors of the day. Still, I will
</p>
<p>aever believe him to have been, as he is sometimes depicted, an aban-
</p>
<p>doned profligate. Much of the obloquy, that was heaped upon his name,
</p>
<p>appears to have emanated from political antagonists, and, of all things in
</p>
<p>this world, political diatribes are assuredly the most pregnant with false-
</p>
<p>tiood. Now Sallust, it seems, being the decided enemy of Pompey

</p>
<p>.^ad said of that Roman, that he was a man " oris probi, animo invere-
</p>
<p>cundo." Lenaeus, the freedman of Pompey, to whom you alluded a
</p>
<p>short time ago, avenged his master by the most virulent abuse of his
</p>
<p>enemy, in a work which would seem to have made a complete sacrifice
</p>
<p>of truth to invective. 1
</p>
<p>H. From what premises, Doctor, do you draw this latter inference,
</p>
<p>since the work itself has not come down to us 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Why, Henry, we may fairly judge, I think, of the injustice
</p>
<p>which he did to the life of the historian, from what he says of him as
</p>
<p>an author. He calls him, as we learn from Suetonius, " nebulonem
</p>
<p>vita scriptisque monstrosum ; praeterea priscorum Catonisque inerudi-
</p>
<p>tissimum furem."2 This is the language of one of your thorough-going
</p>
<p>political partisans, who has entrusted his reason as well as his principles to
</p>
<p>the safe-keeping of his leader.  I wish we had the life of Sallust written
</p>
<p>by Asconius Pedianus, in the age of Augustus ; it might have served
</p>
<p>as a corrective of the unfavourable impressions which have been pro-
</p>
<p>duced by this libel, for it deserves no better name, of the freedman of
</p>
<p>Pompey.
</p>
<p>H. Aye, Doctor, but what will you say to the declamation against
</p>
<p>Sallust which has actually reached our times, and that too from the
</p>
<p>pen of Cicero 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Cicero never wrote it, Henry. It appeared long after the
</p>
<p>death of that orator, and is now generally assigned, by critics, to a rheto
</p>
<p>rician in the reign of Claudius, called Porcius Latro. It is in the style
</p>
<p>of what we may suppose Lenaeus's work to have been, a tissue of invent
</p>
<p>ed or exaggerated calumnies, altogether unworthy of grave credence. 3
</p>
<p>H. And yet, Doctor, I was told by Boydel, of Christ-church, no longer
</p>
<p>ago than last evening, that Le Clerc, the Hebrew professor at Am-
</p>
<p>sterdam, and also Meisner of Prague, in their respective accounts of the
</p>
<p>life of Sallust, have adopted these very calumnies which you so openly
</p>
<p>condemn.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Boydel should have told you also, Henry, that Sallust's char-
</p>
<p>acter has received more justice in the prefatory memoir and notes of De
</p>
<p>Brosses,4 and from the researches of Wieland. 5  But come, let us now

</p>
<p>.ate in the art of historic composition, since that was in a very low
</p>
<p>state when Sallust began to write. He, therefore, naturally recurred co
</p>
<p>the productions of the Greek historians, and attempted to transplant into
</p>
<p>his own language the vigour and conciseness which characterise in so
</p>
<p>eminent a degree the style of Thucydides. 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Very correctly remarked, my young friend, only you ought tu
</p>
<p>have added, that the strict imitation, with which Sallust has followed
</p>
<p>his Grecian prototype, has gone far towards lessening the effect of his
</p>
<p>own original genius. Still we cannot but admire the wonderful success
</p>
<p>of the Roman writer, in imitating the vigour and conciseness of the
</p>
<p>Grecian historian, and infusing into his composition something of that
</p>
<p>dignified austerity which distinguishes the work of his great model.
</p>
<p>H. But, Doctor, you surely do not mean to be understood as affirm-
</p>
<p>mg, that Sallust's style is an imitation of that of Thucydides 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. The question does you credit, Henry. I mean, when I say
</p>
<p>that Sallust imitates 'lie historian of the Peloponnesian war, an imita-
</p>
<p>tion of his general manner, his rapidity, his force, his power of com-
</p>
<p>pression, rather than of his language. Thucydides, for example, often
</p>
<p>employs long and involved periods, while Sallust is ever abrupt and sen-
</p>
<p>tentious, even to a fault.  Have you taken notice how often the latter
</p>
<p>rejects the copulative 1
</p>
<p>H. I have, Doctor, and I think it produces a monotonous effect, and
</p>
<p>a total want of that flow and variety which constitute the principal charm
</p>
<p>of the historic period.  I was walking yesterday, with a fellow-common-
</p>
<p>er of All-Souls, and, the conversation happening to turn upon Sallust,
</p>
<p>and the peculiarities of his style, we made up between us the following
</p>
<p>list of items, about which, my dear Doctor, although a little matter in it-
</p>
<p>self, I would like to have your opinion.  We noticed, in the first place,
</p>
<p>that, in the ablative absolute, he sometimes suppresses the noun ; as,
</p>
<p>proctitis quos ducebat ; 2 and the antecedent to the relative ; as, quam oh
</p>
<p>quae praedicabat.% We observed also particular expressions frequently
</p>
<p>occurring ; as ex sententia, etiam turn, sine mora, &c. Then again, we
</p>
<p>found several instances, where two words nearly synonymous were em
</p>
<p>ployed ; as, earns, acceptusque,  varius incertusquc,  bonum atque ho?t-

</p>
<p>estum,  rogat atque hortatur, &c. We remarked, also, the use of the
</p>
<p>infinitive for the gerund ; as gratificari for gratificandi,*  adgredi, for
</p>
<p>adgrediendi ; 5 and the omission of the connectives et and que occurs
</p>
<p>on almost every page. Another peculiarity, also, forced itself upon our

<p>attention, his use of two different constructions in the compass of the

<p>same sentence ; and, as for his archaisms, we voted the greater part of
</p>
<p>them to be decided specimens of the worst kind of affectation.  Well,
</p>
<p>Doctor, what do you think of our critique ?
</p>
<p>Dr. B. I like it, Henry ; and think that you and your fellow- Oxonian
</p>
<p>have given a very fair sketch of the minor peculiarities of Sallust.
</p>
<p>Whether his archaisms, however, deserve the name of affectations is a
</p>
<p>point on which you will find many differing from you. My own opinion
</p>
<p>is with you and your friend. Sallust introduces into his history a num-
</p>
<p>ber of words almost considered in his time as obsolete, and which were
</p>
<p>selected from the works of the older authors of Rome, particularly Cato
</p>
<p>the censor ; and it is here that he laid himself open to attack from Pollio
</p>
<p>in his letters to Plancus! His style, on the whole, indicates too much
</p>
<p>study and careful pruning, and is deficient in gracefulness and ease. I
</p>
<p>would not advise you to make him your model.
</p>
<p>H. This reminds me, Doctor, of old Roger Ascham's work, "The
</p>
<p>Schoolmaster," which I slightly examined the other day in the Bodleian,
</p>
<p>and where I found the opinion of Sir John Cheke relative to the merits
</p>
<p>of Sallust's Latinity. Sir John said, " that he could not recommend Sal-
</p>
<p>lust as a good pattern of style for young men, because in his writings
</p>
<p>there was more art than nature, and more labour than art ; and in his
</p>
<p>labour, also, too much toil, as it were with an uncontented care to write
</p>
<p>better than he could."  But, Doctor, how stands Sallust, as regards the
</p>
<p>delineation of character 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Here his merits are undoubted. Five or six of the characters
</p>
<p>drawn by him have been regarded in all ages as master-pieces of their
</p>
<p>kind. I need hardly mention the portraits of Catiline, Jugurtha, and
</p>
<p>Marius, nor the celebrated parallel between Caesar and Cato. There
</p>
<p>is something in the latter which always reminds me of the well-known
</p>
<p>sketch of Chatham, the father of Pitt :  " The secretary stood alone,"
</p>
<p>&c. Cato and Chatham were congenial spirits, and a Pythagorean
</p>
<p>would cite them as an illustration of his doctrine of the metempsychosis.
</p>
<p>H. What think you, Doctor, of the specimens of eloquence that are
</p>
<p>afforded by the speeches of Sallust 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. I think them admirable of their kind, Henry, and in excellent

<p>keeping with the characters to whom they are respectively assigned.
</p>
<p>"Nothing, for example, can be better adapted to the character of Caesar,

<p>as far as we have been made acquainted with it by contemporary testi-

<p>mony, than the cool, and argumentative, and specious harangue, in which

<p>he seeks to rescue the conspirators from the fate which is so justly theii

<p>while th6 words of Marius are the effusions of a blunt and gallant soldier,
</p>
<p>who had as yet displayed no traces of the cold-blooded assassin, the
</p>
<p>tyrant, buffoon, and usurper.
</p>
<p>H. But is it possible, Dr. Barton, that Sallust oan be correct, in
</p>
<p>making Caesar a sceptic with regard to the soul's immortality 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Aye, Henry, and worse than a sceptic, a downright unbeliever.
</p>
<p>The whole tenour of Caesar's life is in strict accordance with this. His
</p>
<p>secret disregard for all morality, his open contempt for all honourable
</p>
<p>principles, his cold and selfish and murderous ambition, as if the lives
</p>
<p>of his fellow-men were but the playthings of an hour  every thing, in
</p>
<p>short, in the character of this remarkable man, reveals to our view a
</p>
<p>bosom warmed by no spark of social feeling, but as dark and as silent as
</p>
<p>the grave. It was but natural, therefore, that such a mind should see,
</p>
<p>or rather wish to see, in the horizon of the future, nothing but the gloom
</p>
<p>of annihilation, and should regard the doctrine of a future state of exist-
</p>
<p>ence as a bubble and a dream. How different from all this is the lan-
</p>
<p>guage of our own philosopher, who had penetrated deeply into the mys-
</p>
<p>teries of nature, and yet, with humbled feelings, could stoop & kindle
</p>
<p>che torch of knowledge at the altars of his God. " I envy no quality
</p>
<p>of the mind," he remarks, " or of intellect in others, be it genius, power,
</p>
<p>wit, or fancy : but if I could choose what would be most delightful, and
</p>
<p>I believe most useful to me, I should prefer a firm religious belief to
</p>
<p>every other blessing ; for it makes life a discipline of goodness ; creates

<p>the destruction of existence, the most gorgeous of all lights ; awakens
</p>
<p>life even in death, and from corruption and decay calls up beauty and
</p>
<p>divinity ; makes an instrument of torture and shame the ladder of ascent
</p>
<p>to Paradise ; and, far above all combinations of earthly hopes, calls up
</p>
<p>the most delightful visions of palms and amaranths, the gardens of the

<p>cal speculations of La Place, who could see in the wonders of the uni-

</p>
<p>Dr. B. Why, Henry, as for atheists, if such singular beings do it*,
</p>
<p>fact exist, there is one simple argument which they can never answer.
</p>
<p>Ere we can say that there is no God, w T e must have roamed over all
</p>
<p>nature, and seen that no mark of a divine footstep was there ; and we
</p>
<p>must have gotten intimacy with every existent spirit in the universe, and

</p>
<p>earned from each that never did a revelation of the Deity visit him ;
</p>
<p>and we must have searched, not into the records of one solitary planet,
</p>
<p>but into the archives of all worlds, and thence gathered, that, throughout
</p>
<p>the wide realms of immensity, not one exhibition of a reigning and living
</p>
<p>God ever has been made. In other words, before man can deny the
</p>
<p>existence of God, he must be a God himself, for he must possess *he
</p>
<p>ubiquity and omniscience of the Godhead. 1  But let us return from our
</p>
<p>digression. Where were we 1
</p>
<p>H. We were alluding to the skill which Sallust displays in adapting
</p>
<p>hi3 speeches to different characters.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Well, then, we will now take up the consideration of his
</p>
<p>works.  The first production of Sallust was the " Conspiracy of Cati-
</p>
<p>line." He had attained the age of twenty-two years when the conspiracy
</p>
<p>broke out, and was an eye-witness of the whole proceedings. He had,
</p>
<p>therefore, every means in his power for giving an accurate history of this
</p>
<p>very remarkable event, nor has he neglected to employ them. In the
</p>
<p>detail of facts, he is entitled to our fullest confidence ; for, in every thing
</p>
<p>of importance, he coincides fully with Cicero, whose Catilinarian orations
</p>
<p>form, in fact, an excellent commentary on the work of the historian.
</p>
<p>But Sallust lived too near the times which he describes to be an impar-
</p>
<p>tial writer. Private animosity and party feeling warped his judgment ;
</p>
<p>and it is frequently but too apparent, that we are listening not to the
</p>
<p>philosophic historian, but to the political partisan. He is too favourable
</p>
<p>to Caesar ; he is unjust towards Cicero ; and, although fond of display-
</p>
<p>ing his skill in drawing characters, he exercises none of it on the Roman
</p>
<p>orator. But to this we have already alluded. As for the preface to the
</p>
<p>work, it is, like that to the Jugurthine War, rather a compliment paid by
</p>
<p>the author to his own character and pursuits, than a pertinent introduc-
</p>
<p>tion to an historical narrative.
</p>
<p>H. With regard, Doctor, to the subject of that narrative, do you not
</p>
<p>think the picture of the conspiracy is somewhat overcharged, and that
</p>
<p>it was merely an effort, on the part of the lower orders, to break the
</p>
<p>chains imposed upon them by an odious and tyrannical aristocracy 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Some persons, at the present day, are inclined to favour this

</p>
<p>opinion,2 Henry, but I am afraid they are guided, in forming it, rather too
</p>
<p>much by their own private feelings and the political aspect of their own
</p>
<p>times. They appear to forget altogether the character of the leader in
</p>
<p>this nefarious undertaking, and do not perceive that, if his immediate
</p>
<p>followers were oppressed by any thing, it was by the heavy burden of
</p>
<p>iieir own vices. But of all this we will talk at some other time

<p>xx LIFE AND WRITINGS OF SALLUST.
</p>
<p>Let us proceed to the Jugurthine war. Although not an eye-witness
</p>
<p>of this contest, yet Sallust' s situation, as governor of Numidia, which
</p>
<p>seems to have suggested the composition, was favourable to the author-
</p>
<p>ity of the work, as it afforded him the means of collecting materials
</p>
<p>and procuring information.
</p>
<p>H. Do you think, Doctor, that his residence in Africa was of am
</p>
<p>advantage to him as regarded a knowledge of its earlier history 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Of none whatever. His account of the first settling of Africa
</p>
<p>is a mere fable, although he quotes in its behalf the Punic books of King
</p>
<p>Hiempsal, (referring probably to documents preserved in his archives,i)
</p>
<p>and the traditions of the inhabitants themselves. His geographical
</p>
<p>descriptions, however, if we except a few slight errors, are extremely
</p>
<p>valuable.  But to return to his account of the war. Sallust has been
</p>
<p>charged with partiality towards the character of Marius, and with giving,
</p>
<p>for the sake of his favourite leader, an unfair account of the massacre
</p>
<p>at Vaga. In this, however, I cannot concur ; and the best answer to
</p>
<p>the charge in question is the ample justice which he does to Metellus,
</p>
<p>in describing the war as almost brought to a close by him previous to
</p>
<p>the arrival of Marius. As a piece of composition, this narrative deserves
</p>
<p>to rank very highly, and the varying nature of the contest, the talents,
</p>
<p>the endless resources, the total want of principle, the sufferings of con-
</p>
<p>science, which are all found combined in the character of Jugurtha,
</p>
<p>stand forth in vivid and picturesque colours, and convey a moral lesson
</p>
<p>not easy to be effaced.2
</p>
<p>H. I have often dwelt upon that picture, Dr. Barton, and upon the
</p>
<p>miseries of suspicion and remorse which Jugurtha created for himself by
</p>
<p>his own atrocities ; and it has been often a question with me, whether
</p>
<p>he were not more wretched, on the throne, than in the dungeon where
</p>
<p>he terminated his miserable existence.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Let us pass now to the History of Sallust. This was a civil
</p>
<p>and military history of the republic, in five books, including a period,
</p>
<p>however, of only thirteen years, from the resignation of the dictatorship
</p>
<p>by Sylla, till the promulgation of the Manilian law. The period thus
</p>
<p>embraced was a short but momentous one ; Mithridates, in the East

</p>
<p>displaying all the resources of his powerful genius against the Roman
</p>
<p>rule, and Sertorius, in the West, turning the arms of the republic against
</p>
<p>itself, while the bosom of Italy was the scene of a formidable commo-
</p>
<p>tion, excited by a host of gladiators and slaves. The work was intro-
</p>
<p>duced )y two discourses, the one containing a delineation of the govern-

<p>ment of Rome, and the habits and manners of its people, from the

</p>
<p>earliest period to the commencement of the civil wars ; the other
</p>
<p>giving a general view of the dissensions between Sylla and Marius.*
</p>
<p>H. Why, Doctor, it must have connected the termination of the
</p>
<p>Jugurthme war with the commencement of Catiline's conspiracy. Whai
</p>
<p>a pity it has not come down to us.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. And the more so, too, since all the accounts of Roman his-
</p>
<p>tory which have been written are defective during the very period which
</p>
<p>it embraced. Nearly seven hundred fragments, belonging to it, have
</p>
<p>been collected from scholiasts and grammarians, by the President de
</p>
<p>Brosses,2 but they are too short and unconnected to serve any valuable
</p>
<p>purpose. When I say this, however, I mean to be understood as except-
</p>
<p>ing four orations and two letters, and a fragment giving a description
</p>
<p>of a splendid entertainment, with which Metellus was honoured on his
</p>
<p>return, after a year's absence, to his government of Farther Spain. This
</p>
<p>work was the production of Sallust's matured intellect, anu the last
</p>
<p>which he composed. It was inscribed to Lucullus, the son of the cele-
</p>
<p>brated commander.
</p>
<p>H. Are there not, Doctor, two political discourses, concerning the
</p>
<p>administration of the government, in the form of letters to Julius Caesar,
</p>
<p>which are supposed to have been the productions of Sallust 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. They are commonly thought to have been composed by him,
</p>
<p>but the grounds of this opinion are far from satisfactory. to one who
</p>
<p>examines the subject with any attention. 3
</p>
<p>H. Many thanks to you, my dear Doctor, for your kindness in
</p>
<p>devoting ro much of your valuable time to this notice of Sallust and
</p>
<p>his writings. I hope I may be able to profit by them in the prosecution
</p>
<p>if my private studies, and that it will be allowed me occasionally to con-
</p>
<p>sult you on other points of classical biography.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. You will always find me ready, and willing, Henry, to co-
</p>
<p>operate in so praiseworthy an undertaking. God bless you, my dear
</p>
<p>boy ; and may you become in after-life an honour to your friends and
</p>
<p>an ornament to our common country : for the truest definition of happi-
</p>
<p>ness is, a cultivated intellect in unison with a virtuous heart.  Farewell.

</p>
<p>tempore benigne respondit. Micipsa paucis diebns mo-

<p>ritur Postquam illi, more regio, \justa magnifiee fece-

<p>rant, reguli in unum convenere, uti inter se de cunctis

</p>
<p>quia materno genere impar erat, despiciens, 3 dextra Ad-
</p>
<p>herbalem adsedit ; ne medius ex tribus, quod apud Nu-
</p>
<p>midas honori ducitur, Jugurtha foret. Dein tamen, uti
</p>
<p>aetati concederet, fatigatus a fratre, vix in partem alteram
</p>
<p>transductus est. Ibi, 4 cum multa de administrando imperio
</p>
<p>dissererent, Jugurtha inter alias res jacit : oportere

<p>QUINQUENNII CONSULTA OMNIA ET DECRETA RESCINDI ;

<p>NAM PER EA TEMPORA CONFECTUM ANNIS MICIPSAM PARUM

</p>
<p>respondit ; nam 5 ipsum illum tribus his proxumis an

<p>NIS ADOPTATIONE IN REGNUM PERVENISSE. Quod Verbum
</p>
<p>in pectus Jugurthae altius, quam quisquam ratus, descen-

</p>
<p>rare atque ea modo animo habere, quibus Hiempsal per

<p>dolum caperetur. Quae ubi tardius procedunt, neque leni-

<p>XIII. Ceterum fama tanti facinoris per omnem Africam
</p>
<p>brevi divulgatur : Adherbalem 1 omnisque, qui sub impeno
</p>
<p>Micipsae fuerant, metus invadit : in duas partis disce-
</p>
<p>dunt : plures Adherbalem sequuntur, sed ilium alteram
</p>
<p>bello meliores. Igitur Jugurtha quam maxumas potest
</p>
<p>copias armat ; urbis 2 partim vi, alias voluntate imperio
</p>
<p>suo adjungit ; omni Numidiae imperare parat. Adherbai,
</p>
<p>3 tamen etsi Romam legatos miserat, qui senatum doce-
</p>
<p>rent de caede fratris et fortunis suis ; tamen, fretus mul-
</p>
<p>titudine militum, parabat armis contendere. Sed, ubi res
</p>
<p>ad certamen venit, victus ex praelio profugit in 4 provh>
</p>
<p>ciam, ac deinde Romam contendit. Turn Jugurtha, 5 pa-
</p>
<p>tratis consiliis, in otio facinus suum cum animo reputans
</p>
<p>timere populum Romanum, neque advorsus iram ejus
</p>
<p>usquam, nisi in avaritia nobilitatis et pecunia sua, spern
</p>
<p>habere. Itaque paucis diebus cum auro et argento multo
</p>
<p>Romam mittit, 6 quis praecepit, uti primum veteres amicos
</p>
<p>muneribus expleant ; deinde novos adquirant ; postremo .
</p>
<p>quemcumque possint largiundo parare, ne cunctentur
</p>
<p>Sed, ubi Romam legati venere, et, ex praecepto regis,
</p>
<p>nospitibus, 7 aliisque, quorum ea tempestate auctoritas pol
</p>
<p>lebat, magna munera misere ; tanta commutatio incessit,
</p>
<p>uti ex maxuma invidia in gratiam et favorem nobilitatis
</p>
<p>Jugurtha veniret ; quorum pars spe, alii praemio inducti,
</p>
<p>8 singulos ex senatu ambiundo, nitebantur, ne gravius in
</p>
<p>eum consuleretur. Igitur, legati ubi satis eonfidunt, die
</p>
<p>constituto, 9 senatus utrisque datur. Turn Adherbalem hoc

</p>
<p>in Europa. 3 Ea finis habet, ab occidente 4 fretum nostri

<p>maris et oceani ; ab ortu solis, 5 declivem latitudinem,
</p>
<p>quern locum Catabathmon incolae adpellant. Mare sae-

<p>atque alia praeda capit, aedificia incendit, pleraque loca
</p>

</p>
<p>dine in regnum suum 4 convertit, exists oians dolore per-
</p>

<p>haud longe a mari, prope Cirtam oppidum, utriusque

<p>consedit exercitus : et, quia die extremum erat, praelium
</p>
<p>non inceptum. Ubi plerumque noctis processit, 1 obscuro
</p>
<p>etiam turn lumine, milites Jugurthini, signo dato, castra
</p>
<p>hostium invadunt ; semisomnos partim, alios arma su-

<p>mentes fugant funduntque ; Adberbal cum paucis equiti-
</p>
<p>bus Cirtam profugit, et, ni multitudo togatorum fuisset,
</p>
<p>quae Numidas insequentes moenibus prohibuit, uno die
</p>
<p>inter duos reges coeptum atque patratum bellum foret.
</p>
<p>Igitur Jugurtha oppidum circurnsedit, 2 vineis turribusque et

<p>machinis omnium generum expugnare adgreditur ; maxume

<p>festinans 3 tempus legatorum antecapere, quos, ante prae-

</p>
<p>quod Romae, dum proficisci parant, de praelio facto et op-
</p>
<p>pugnatione Cirtae audiebatur : sed is rumor 5 clemens erat.
</p>
<p>Quorum Jugurtha accepta oratione respondit : " sibi

<p>Memmius populo persuadet, uti 2 L. Cassius, qui turn

<p>praetor erat, ad Jugurtham mitteretur, interposita fide

<p>publica, Romam duceret ; quo facilius, indicio regis,
</p>
<p>Scauri et reliquorum, 2 quos pecuniae captae arcessebant,

<p>tanta vis avaritiae in animos eorum, veluti tabes, invaserat.
</p>
<p>At Cassius, *perlata rogations a C. Memmio, ac perculsa

<p>omni nobilitate, ad Jugurtham proficiscitur : ei timido, et
</p>
<p>ex conscientia diffident! rebus suis, persuadet, " quo se

</p>

<p>quod eorum alium conscientia, alium mala fama et timor

<p>XXXYIII. At Jugurtha, cognita 1 vanitate atque impe-

</p>
<p>pactioiiis perpulit, uti, relicto Suthule, in abditas re-
</p>
<p>giones sese, veluti cedentem, insequeretur. Interea per
</p>
<p>homines callidos die noctuque exercitum tentabat :
</p>
<p>centuriones ducesque turmarum, partim uti transfugerent,
</p>
<p>alii, signo dato, locum uti desererent : ita delicta occul-
</p>
<p>tiora fore. Quae postquam ex sententia instruit, 2 intem-
</p>
<p>pesta nocte, de improviso multitudine Numidarum Auli
</p>
<p>castra circivmvenit. Milites Romani, tumultu perculsi

<p>insolito, arma capere alii, alii se abdere, pars territos
</p>
<p>confirmare ; trepidare omnibus locis : vis magna hostium ;

<p>coelum nocte atque nubibus obscuratum ; periculum an-
</p>

<p>Auio omnes infesti, ac maxume qui bello saepe praeclari
</p>
<p>fuerant, quod armatus, 1 dedecore potius, quam manu salu-
</p>
<p>tern quaesiverat. Ob ea consul Albinus ex delicto fra-
</p>
<p>tris invidiam, ac deinde periculum timens, senatum de
</p>
<p>foedere consulebat : et tamen interim exercitui supple-
</p>
<p>mentum scribere : ab sociis et nomine Latino auxilia
</p>
<p>arcessere : denique modis omnibus festinare. Senatus
</p>
<p>ita, uti par fuerat, decernit, suo atque populi injussu
</p>
<p>nullum potuisse foedus fieri. Consul impeditus a
</p>
<p>tribunis plebis ne, quas paraverat copias, secum portaret,
</p>
<p>paucis diebus in Africam proflciscitur : nam omnis exer-
</p>
<p>citus, uti convenera/tj Numidia deductus, in 2 provincia
</p>
<p>hiemabat. Postquam eo venit ; quamquam persequi Ju-
</p>
<p>gurtham et mederi fraternae invidiae animus ardebat ;
</p>
<p>cognitis militibus, quos, praeter fugam, soluto imperio,
</p>
<p>licentia atque lascivia corruperant, ex copia rerum statuit,
</p>
<p>nihil sibi agitandum.
</p>
<p>XL. Interea Romae C. Mamilius Limetanus, tribunus
</p>
<p>plebis, 3 rogationem ad populum promulgat, " uti quaere-
</p>
<p>retur in eos, quorum consilio Jugurtha senati decreta
</p>
<p>neglegisset ; quique ab eo in legationibus, aut imperiis
</p>

<p>pactiones fecissent." Huic rogationi, partim conscii sibi,

<p>alii ex partium invidia pericula metuentes, quoniam aperte

</p>
<p>Sed plebes, incredibile memoratu est, quam intenta fuerit,

</p>
<p>tur. Sed quaestio exercita aspere violenterque, ex rumore
</p>
<p>et lubidine plebis : ut saepe nobilitatem, sic ea tempestate
</p>
<p>plebem ex secundis rebus insolentia ceperat.
</p>
<p>XLI. Ceterum 1 mos partium popularium et senati
</p>
<p>factionum, ac deinde omnium 2 malarum artium, paucis ante
</p>
<p>annis Romae ortus, otio et abundantia earum rerum,
</p>
<p>quae prima mortales ducunt. Nam, ante Carthaginem
</p>
<p>deletam, populus et senatus Romanus placide modesteque
</p>
<p>inter se rempublicam tractabant : neque gloriae, neque
</p>
<p>dominationis certamen inter civis erat : metus hostilis in
</p>
<p>bonis artibus civitatem retinebat. Sed, ubi ilia formido
</p>
<p>mentibus discessit ; scilicet ea, quae secundae res amant,
</p>
<p>lascivia atque superbia incessere. Ita, quod in advorsis
</p>
<p>rebus optaverant, otium, postquam adepti sunt, 3 asperius
</p>
<p>acerbiusque fuit. Namque coepere nobilitas ^dignitatem,
</p>
<p>populus libertatem in lubidinem vertere : sibi quisque
</p>
<p>6 ducere, trahere, rapere. Ita omnia in duas partis ab-
</p>
<p>stracts sunt ; respublica, quae media fuerat, dilacerata.
</p>
<p>Ceterum nobilitas factione magis pollebat : plebis vis,
</p>
<p>soluta atque dispersa in multitudine, -minus poterat : pau-
</p>
<p>corum arbitrio belli domique 6 agitabatur : penes eosdem
</p>
<p>aerarium, provinciae, magistratus, gloriae triumphique
</p>
<p>erant : populus militia atque in )pia urguebatur ; praedas
</p>
<p>bellicas imperatores cum pauci i diripiebant. Interea pa-
</p>
<p>rentes, aut parvi liberi militum, ut quisque potentiori con-
</p>
<p>finis erat, sedibus pellebantur. Ita cum potentia avaritia,
</p>
<p>sine modo modestiaque, invadere, polluere et vastare
</p>
<p>omnia ; "nihil pensi, neque sancti habere, quoad semet
</p>
<p>ipsa praecipitavit. Nam ubi primum 8 ex nobilitate reperti
</p>
<p>sunt, qui veram gloriam injustae potentiae anteponerent ;
</p>
<p>moveri civitas, et permixtio civilis, quasi discessio terrae,

<p>sane Gracchis, cupidine victoriae, haud satis moderatus
</p>
<p>animus fuit. Sed 2 bono vinci satius est, quam malo more
</p>
<p>injuriam vincere. Igitur ea victoria nobilitas ex lubidine
</p>
<p>sua usa, multos mortalis ferro aut fuga exstinxit ; plusque
</p>
<p>in reliquum sibi timoris, quam potentiae, addidit. Quae
</p>
<p>res plerumque magnas civitatis pessum dedit ; dum alteri
</p>
<p>alteros vincere quovis modo, et victos acerbius u'cisci
</p>
<p>volunt. Sed, de 3 studiis partium et omnibus civitatis mo-
</p>
<p>ribus si singulatim, aut pro magnitudine, parem disserere,

<p>tempus, quam res, maturius deserat. Quamobrem ad

<p>inceptum redeo.

<p>XLIII. Post Auli foedus, exercitusque nostri foedam
</p>
<p>fugam, Q. Metellus et M. Silanus, consules designati,
</p>
<p>provincias inter se partiverant : Metelloque Numidia

<p>evenerat, 4 acri viro, et quamquam advorso populi partium,
</p>
<p>fama tamen aequabili et inviolata. Is ubi primum ma-
</p>
<p>gistratum ingressus est, 5 alia omnia sibi cum collega ratus,
</p>
<p>ad bellum, quod gesturus erat, animum intendit. Igitur

<p>Ceterum ad ea patranda senati auctoritate socii nomenque

<p>.leque laboris patiens, lingua, quam manu, promtior, prae-
</p>
<p>dator ex sociis, et ipse praeda hostium, sine imperio et
</p>
<p>modestia habitus. Ita imperatori novo plus ex malis mo-
</p>
<p>ribus sollicitudinis, quam ex copia militum auxilii, aut
</p>
<p>spei bonae accedebat. Statuit tamen Metellus, quamquam
</p>
<p>et ^estivorum tempus comitiorum mora imminuerat, et
</p>
<p>exspectatione eventi civium animos intentos putabat, non
</p>
<p>prius bellum adtingere, quam, majorum disciplina, milites
</p>
<p>iaborare coegisset. Nam Albinus, Auli fratris exercitus-
</p>
<p>que clade perculsus, postquam decreverat non egredi
</p>
<p>provincia, 2 quantum temporis aestivorum in imperio fuit,
</p>
<p>plerumque milites stativis castris habebat : nisi cum odos,
</p>
<p>aut pabuli egestas locum mutare subegerat. Sed neque
</p>
<p>more militari vigiliae 3 deducebantur : uti cuique lubebat,

<p>ab signis aberat. Lixae permixti cum militibus die
</p>
<p>noctuque vagabantur, et palantes agros vastare, 4 villas
</p>
<p>expugnare, pecoris et mancipiorum praedas certantes
</p>
<p>agere ; eaque mutare cum mercatoribus vino advectitio,

<p>et aliis talibus : praeterea, frumentum publice datum ven

</p>
<p>aut fingi queunt ignaviae luxuriaeque probra, in illo exer-

</p>
<p>iem cum suppliciis mittit, qui tantummodo ipsi liberisque
</p>
<p>vitam peterent, alia omnia dederent populo Romano. Sed
</p>
<p>Metello jam ante a 3 experimentis cognitum erat genus
</p>
<p>Numidarum infidum, ingenio mobili, novarum rerum avi-
</p>
<p>dum. Itaque legatos alium ab alio divorsos adgreditur ;

<p>Antea jam docti ab Jugurtha equites, ubicumque Romano-

<p>Ita ^umero priores, si ab persequendo hostis deterrere

<p>LIL Eo modo inter se duo imperatores, summi vir
</p>
<p>certabant ; ipsi pares, ceterum opibus disparibus. Nam
</p>
<p>Metello virtus militum erat, locus advorsus : Jugurthae
</p>
<p>a]''a omnia, praeter milites, opportuna. Denique Romani,
</p>
<p>ubi intellegunt, neque sibi perfugium esse, neque ab hoste
</p>
<p>copiam pugnandi fieri, et jam die vesper erat ; T advorso
</p>
<p>colle, sicuti praeceptum fuerat, evadunt. Amisso loco,
</p>
<p>Numidae fusi fugatique : pauci interiere ; plerosque
</p>
<p>velocitas et regio hostibus ignara tutata sunt. Interea

<p>cit : ac, dum legatus ad flumen, quo praemissus erat,
</p>
<p>festinans pergit, quietus, uti res postulabat, aciem exornat :
</p>
<p>neque remittit, 3 quid ubique hostis ageret, explorare.
</p>
<p>Postquam Rutilium consedisse jam, et animo vacuum
</p>
<p>accepit, simulque ex Jugurthae praelio clamorem augeri ;
</p>
<p>veritus, ne legatus, cognita re, laborantibus suis auxilio
</p>
<p>foret, aciem, quam drffidens virtuti militum 4 arte statuerat,
</p>
<p>quo hostium itineri obficeret, latius porrigit ; eoque modo
</p>
<p>ad Rutilii castra procedit.
</p>
<p>LIU. Romani ex improviso pulveris vim magnam ani-

</p>

</p>
<p>remissi patiebatur. Ac primo, obscura nocte, postquam
</p>
<p>haud procul inter se erant, 2 strepitu, velut bostes adven-
</p>
<p>tarent, alteri apud alteros formidinem simul, et tumultum
</p>
<p>faoere : et paene imprudentia admissum facinus mise-
</p>
<p>rabile, ni utrimque praemissi equites rem exploravissent.
</p>
<p>Igitur, pro metu, repente gaudium exortum, milites alius
</p>
<p>alium laeti adpellant, acta edocent atque audimit : sua
</p>
<p>quisque fortia facta ad coelum ferre. Quippe res huma-
</p>
<p>nae ita sese habent : in victoria vel ignavis gloriari licet :
</p>
<p>advorsae res etiam bonos detractant.
</p>
<p>LIV. Metellus in isdem castris quatriduo moratus,
</p>
<p>4 saucios cum cura reflcit, meritos in praeliis more militiae
</p>
<p>donat, universos in concione laudat, atque agit gratias ;
</p>
<p>hortatur, ad cetera, quae levia sunt, parem animum
</p>
<p>gerant : pro victoria satis jam pugnatum, reliquos labores
</p>
<p>pro praeda fore. Tamen interim transfugas et alios
</p>
<p>opportunos, Jugurtha 5 ubi gentium, aut quid agitaret, cum
</p>
<p>paucisne esset, an exercitum haberet, ut sese victus
</p>
<p>gereret exploratum misit. At ille sese in loca saltuosa
</p>
<p>et natura munita receperat ; ibique cogebat exercitum
</p>
<p>6 numero liominum ampliorem, sed bebetem inflrmumque,
</p>
<p>agri ac pecoris magis, quam belli cultorem. Id 7 ea gratia
</p>
<p>eveniebat, quod, praeter regios equites, nemo omnium
</p>
<p>Numidarum ex fuga regem sequitur ; quo cujusque animus
</p>
<p>fert, eo discedunt : neque id 8 flagitium militiae ducitur :
</p>
<p>ita se mores habent. Igitur Metellus ubi videt regis
</p>
<p>etiam turn animum 9 ferocem ; bellum renovari, quod, nisi
</p>
<p>ex illius lubidine, geri non posset ; praeterea iniquum
</p>
<p>certamen sibi cum hostibus, minore detrimento illos vinci
</p>
<p>quam suos vincere ; statuit non praeliis, neque acie, sed
</p>
<p>alio more bellum gerundum. Itaque in Numidiae loca
</p>
<p>opulentissuma pergit, agros vastat, multa castella et oppida,

<p>ubicumque res postulabat, praesidium impositum. Quae

<p>aegotia multo magis, quarn praelium male pugnatum ab

</p>
<p>sita, sequi cogebatur ; et qui ] sua loca defendere nequi-
</p>
<p>verat, in alienis bellum gerere. Tamen ex copia, quod
</p>
<p>optumum \ddebatur, consilium capit : exercitum 2 plerum-
</p>
<p>que in isdem locis opperiri jubet ; ipse cum delectis
</p>
<p>equitibus Metellum sequitur ; nocturnis et 3 aviis itineri-
</p>
<p>bus ignoratus Romanos palantis repente adgreditur :
</p>
<p>eorum plerique inermes cadunt, multi capiuntur ; nemo
</p>
<p>omnium intactus profugit : et Numidae prius, quam ex
</p>
<p>castris subveniretur, sicuti jussi erant, in proxumos collis
</p>
<p>discedunt.
</p>
<p>LY. Interim Romae gaudium ingens ortum, cognitis
</p>
<p>Metelli rebus : 4 ut seque et exercitum more majorum
</p>
<p>gereret ; in advorso loco, victor tamen virtute fuisset ;
</p>
<p>hostium agro potiretur ; Jugurtliam magnificum ex Auli
</p>
<p>secordia, spem salutis in solitudine, aut fuga, coegisset
</p>
<p>habere. Itaque senatus ob ea feliciter acta dis im-
</p>
<p>mortalibus 5 supplicia decernere : civitas, trepida antea
</p>
<p>et sollicita de belli eventu, 6 laeta agere : fama de Me-
</p>
<p>tello 7 praeclara esse. Igitur eo intentior ad victoriam
</p>
<p>niti, omnibus modis festinare ; cavere tamen, necubi hosti
</p>
<p>opportunus fieret : meminisse, post gloriam invidiam
</p>
<p>sequi. Ita quo clarior erat, eo magis animi anxius :
</p>
<p>neque, post insidias Jugurthae, 8 efFuso exercitu praedari :
</p>
<p>ubi frumento, aut pabulo opus erat, cohortes cum omni
</p>
<p>equitatu praesidium agitabant : exercitus 9 partim ipse, reli-
</p>
<p>quos Marius ducebat. Sed igni magis, quam praeda, ager
</p>
<p>vastabatur. Duobus locis, haud longe inter se, castra
</p>
<p>faciebant : ubi vi opus erat, cuncti aderant ; ceterum, quo
</p>
<p>fuga atque formido latius crescerent, 10 divorsi agebant.

</p>
<p>bat, Jugurtham laborantibus suis auxilio venturum, ibique
</p>
<p>praelium fore. At ille, quae parabantur, a 2 perfugis
</p>
<p>edoctus, magnis itineribus Metellum antevenit ; oppidanos
</p>
<p>hortatur, moenia defendant, additis auxilio perfugis, quod

<p>genus ex copiis regis, 3 quia fallere nequibant, firmissu-

<p>itinere fmmentatum cum paucis cohortibus Sic cam mis-

</p>
<p>ab rege defecerat. Eo cum dilectis equitibus noctu
</p>
<p>pergit, et jam egredientibus Romanis 5 in porta pugnam
</p>
<p>facit : simul magna voce Siccenses hortatur, " uti cohor-

<p>tis ab tergo circumveniant : fortunam praeclari facino-
</p>

<p>Contra ea oppidani in proxumos saxa volvere : sudes.,

</p>
<p>aut manu emissa, volnerabant ; parique periculo, sed

<p>fama imparl, boni atque ignavi erant.
</p>
<p>LYIII. Dum apud Zamam sic certatur, Jugurtha ex
</p>
<p>improviso 3 castra hostium cum magna manu invadit ;
</p>
<p>remissis, qui in praesidio erant, et omnia magis, quam
</p>
<p>praelium, exspectantibus, portam irrumpit. At nostri,
</p>
<p>repentino metu perculsi, sibi 4 quisque pro moribus con-
</p>
<p>sulunt : alii fugere, alii arma capere : magna pars vol-
</p>
<p>nerati, aut occisi. Ceterum ex omni multitudine non
</p>
<p>amplius quadraginta, memores nominis Romani, grege
</p>
<p>facto, locum cepere, paullo, quam alii, editiorem : neque
</p>
<p>inde maxuma vi depelli quiverunt : sed tela eminus
</p>
<p>missa remittere, 5 pauci in pluribus minus frustrati : sin
</p>
<p>Numidae propius accessissent, ibi vero virtutem ostendere,
</p>
<p>et eos maxuma vi caedere, fundere atque fugare. Interim
</p>
<p>Metellus, cum acerrume rem gereret, clamorem hostilem
</p>
<p>ab tergo accepit : dein, converso equo, animadvortit,
</p>
<p>fugam 6 ad se vorsum fieri ; quae res indicabat popularis
</p>
<p>esse. Igitur equitatum omnem ad castra propere mittit,
</p>
<p>ac statim C. Marium cum cohortibus sociorum ; eumque,
</p>
<p>lacrumans, per amicitiam perque rempublicam obsecrat,
</p>
<p>ne quam contumeliam remanere in exercitu victore, neve
</p>
<p>hostis 7 inultos abire sinat : ille brevi mandata efneit.

<p>At Jugurtha munimento castrorum impeditus, cum alii
</p>
<p>super vallum praecipitarentur, alii 8 in angustiis ipsi sibi
</p>
<p>properantes obficerent, multis amissis, in loca munita sese
</p>
<p>recepit. Metellus, infecto negotio, postquam nox aderat,

<p>in castra cum exercitu revortitur.

</p>
<p>atque, ut superiore die, murum adgreditur. Interim Ju-
</p>
<p>gurtha ex occulto repente nostros invadit : qui in ^roxumo
</p>
<p>locati fuerant, paullisper territi pertobantur ; reliqui cito
</p>
<p>subveniunt. Neque diutius Numidae resistere quivissent,
</p>
<p>ni pedites cum equitibus permixti magnam cladem in
</p>
<p>congressu facerent : 2 quibus illi freti, non, ut equestn
</p>
<p>praelio solet, sequi, dein cedere ; sed advorsis equis
</p>
<p>concurrere, implicare ac perturbare aciem ; ita expeditis
</p>
<p>peditibus suis hostis paene victos dare.
</p>
<p>LX. Eodem tempore apud Zamam magna vi certa-
</p>
<p>batur. Ubi quisque legatus, aut tribunus curabat, eo acer-
</p>
<p>rume 3 niti ; neque alius in alio magis, quam in sese, spem
</p>
<p>habere : pariter oppidani agere ; obpugnare, aut parare
</p>
<p>omnibus locis : avidius alteri alteros sauciare, quam semet
</p>
<p>tegere : clamor permixtus hortatione, laetitia, gemitu ;
</p>
<p>item strepitus armorum ad ceelum ferri : tela utrimque
</p>
<p>volare. Sed illi, qui moenia defensabant, ubi 4 hostes
</p>
<p>paululum modo piignam remiserant, intenti praelium
</p>
<p>equestre prospectabant : eos, uti quaeque Jugurthae res
</p>
<p>erant, laetos modo, modo pavidos animadvorteres ; ac,
</p>
<p>sicuti audiri a suis, aut cerni possent, monere alii, alii
</p>
<p>hortari, aut manu signiflcare, aut 5 niti corporibus, et hue,
</p>
<p>illuc, quasi vitabundi, aut jacientes tela, agitare. Quod
</p>
<p>ubi Mario cognitum est, (nam is in ea parte curabat,)
</p>
<p>consulto 6 lenius agere, ac difrldentiam rei simulare : pati
</p>
<p>Numidas sine tumultu regis praelium visere. Ita illis
</p>
<p>7 studio suorum adstrictis, repente magna vi murum adgre-
</p>
<p>ditur : et jam scalis aggressi milites prope summa cepe-
</p>
<p>rant, cum oppidani concurrunt, lapides, ignem, alia prae-

<p>terea tela ingerunt. Nostri primo resistere : deinde, ubi

</p>
<p>adflicti sunt ; 9 ceteri, quoquo modo potuere, pauci integri,

</p>
<p>defecerant, satisque munitae loco, aut moenibus erant,
</p>
<p>praesidia imponit. 1 Ceterum exercitum in provinciam qua
</p>
<p>proxuma est Numidiae hiemandi gratia collocat. Neque
</p>
<p>id tempus, ex aliorum more, quieti, aut luxuriae concedit :
</p>
<p>sed, quoniam armis bellum parum procedebat, insidias
</p>
<p>regi per amicos tendere, et eorum perfidia pro armis uti
</p>
<p>parat. Igitur Bomilcarem, qui Romae cum Jugurtha
</p>
<p>fuerat, et inde, 2 vadibus datis, clam Massivae de nece
</p>
<p>judicium fugerat, quod ei, per maxumam amicitiam,
</p>
<p>maxuma copia fallendi erat, multis pollicitationibus adgre-
</p>
<p>ditur ; ac primo efficit, uti ad se colloquendi gratia occul-
</p>
<p>tus veniat : dein fide data, " si Jugurtham vivum aut
</p>
<p>necatum tradidisset, fore, ut illi senatus impunitatem et
</p>
<p>3 sua omnia concederet," facile Numidae persuadet, cum
</p>
<p>ingenio infido, turn metuenti, ne, si pax cum Romanis
</p>
<p>fieret, ipse per conditiones ad supplicium traderetur.
</p>
<p>LXII. Is, ubi primum opportunum, Jugurtham anxium
</p>
<p>ac miserantem fortunas suas accedit : monet atque lacru-
</p>
<p>mans obtestatur, " uti aliquando sibi liberisque et genti
</p>
<p>Numidarum, optume merenti, provideat : omnibus prae-
</p>
<p>liis sese victos, agrum vastatum, multos mortalis captos
</p>
<p>aut occisos, regni opes comminutas esse : satis saepe
</p>
<p>jam et virtutem militum, et fortunam tentatam : caveret,
</p>
<p>ne, 4 illo cunctante, Numidae sibi consulant." His atque
</p>
<p>talibus aliis ad deditionem regis animum impellit. Mit-
</p>
<p>tuntur ad imperatorem legati : " 5 Jugurtham imperata
</p>
<p>facturum, ac sine ulla pactione sese regnumque suum in
</p>
<p>illius fidem tradere." Metellus propere 6 cunctos senatorii
</p>
<p>ordinis ex hibernis arcessiri jubet : eorum atque aliorum,
</p>
<p>quos idoneos ducebat, consilium habet. Ita more majo-
</p>
<p>rum, ex consilii decreto, per legatos Jugurthae imperat

</p>
<p>[gitur Jugurtlia, ubi armis virisque et pecunia spoliatus,
</p>
<p>cum ipse *ad imperandum Tisidium vocaretur, rursus
</p>
<p>coepit 2 flectere animum suum, et ex mala conscientia
</p>
<p>digna timer e. Denique multis diebus per dubitationem
</p>
<p>consumtis ; cum modo taedio rermn advorsarum omnia
</p>
<p>bello potiora duceret, interdum secum ipse reputaret,

<p>quam gravis casus in servitium ex regno foret ; 3 multie
</p>
<p>magnisque praesidiis nequidquam perditis, de integiG bel
</p>
<p>lum sumit. Romae senatus de promiciis consultus 4 Nu-
</p>
<p>midiam Metello decreverat.
</p>
<p>LXIII. Per idem tempus Uticae forte 5 C. Mario, per
</p>
<p>hostias dis supplicanti, " magna atque mirabilia portendi"
</p>
<p>haruspex dixerat : " proinde quae animo 6 agitabat, fretus
</p>
<p>dis ageret ; fortunam quam saepissume experiretur ;
</p>
<p>cuncta prospera eventura." At ilium jam antea consula-
</p>
<p>tus ingens cupido exagitabat : ad quern capiundum,
</p>
<p>7 praeter vetustatem familiae, alia omnia abunde erant ,
</p>
<p>industria, probitas, militiae magna scientia, animus belli
</p>
<p>ingens, domi modicus, lubidinis et divitiarum victor, tan-
</p>
<p>tummodo gloriae avidus. Sed 8 his natus, et omnem
</p>
<p>pueritiam Arpini altus, ubi primum aetas militiae patiens
</p>
<p>fuit, 9 stipendiis faciundis, non Graeca facundia, neque
</p>
<p>l0 urbanis munditiis sese exercuit : ita inter artis bonas
</p>
<p>integrum ingenium brevi adolevit. Ergo ubi primum tri-
</p>
<p>bunatum militarem a populo petit, n pierisque faciem ejus
</p>
<p>ignorantibus, facile notus 12 per omnis tribus declarator,
</p>
<p>Deinde ab eo magistratu alium post alium sibi peperit ;
</p>
<p>semperque 13 in potestatibus eo modo agitabat, uti ampliore,

</p>
<p>corum talis vir, (nam postea ambitione praeceps datus

<p>est,) consulatum appetere non audebat. Etiamtum alios

<p>petundi gratia missionem rogat : cui quamquam virtus,
</p>
<p>gloria, atque alia optanda bonis superabant, tamen inerat
</p>
<p>1 contemtor animus et superbia, commune nobilitatis ma-
</p>
<p>lum. Itaque primum commotus insolita re, mirari ejus
</p>
<p>consilium, et quasi per amicitiam monere, " ne tarn pra,va
</p>
<p>inciperet, neu super fortunam animum gereret : non
</p>
<p>omnia omnibus cupiunda esse : debere illi res suas satis
</p>
<p>placere : postremo caveret id petere a populo Romano,
</p>
<p>quod illi 2 jure negaretur." Postquam haec atque talia
</p>
<p>dixit, neque animus Marii flectitur, respondit, " 3 ubi pri-
</p>
<p>mum potuisset per negotia publica, facturum sese, quae
</p>
<p>peteret." Ac postea saepius eadem postulanti, fertur
</p>
<p>dixisse, " ne festinaret abire : 4 satis mature ilium. cum
</p>
<p>filio suo consulatum petiturum." Is eo tempore contu-
</p>
<p>bernio patris ibidem militabat, 5 annos natus circiter xx.
</p>
<p>Quaeres Marium cum pro honore, quern adfectabat, turn
</p>

</p>
<p>milites, quibus in hibernis praeerat, laxiore imperio, quam
</p>
<p>antea, habere : apud negotiatores, quorum magna multi-
</p>
<p>tudo Uticae erat, 8 criminose simul, et magnince de bello
</p>
<p>loqui : " dimidia pars exercitus sibi permitteretur, paucis

<p>diebus Jugurtham in catenis habiturum : ab imperatore
</p>
<p>consulto 9 trahi, quod homo inanis et regiae superbiae

<p>videbantur, quod diuturnitate belli res familiaris 10 corrupe-

</p>
<p>foret, si equites Romani satellites Numidae traderentur
</p>
<p>Hirnc Marius 1 anxium adgreditur atque hortatur, uti con-
</p>
<p>tumeliarum imperatoris cum suo auxilio poenas petat :
</p>
<p>hominem ob morbos animo parum valido secunda oratione
</p>
<p>extollit : " ilium regem, ingentem virum, Masinissae
</p>
<p>nepotem esse : si Jugurtha captus, aut occisus, imperium
</p>
<p>Numidiae sine mora habiturum : id adeo mature posse
</p>
<p>evenire, si ipse consul ad id bellum missus foret." Itaque
</p>
<p>et ilium, et equites Romanos, 2 milites et negotiatores, alios
</p>
<p>ipse, plerosque spes pacis impellit, uti Romam ad suos
</p>
<p>necessarios aspere in Metellum de bello scribant, Marium
</p>
<p>imperatorem poscant. Sic illi a multis mortalibus 3 ho-
</p>
<p>nestissuma surTragatione consulatus petebatur : simul ea
</p>
<p>tempestate plebes, nobilitate fusa per legem Mamiliam,
</p>
<p>novos extollebat. Ita Mario cuncta procedere.
</p>
<p>LXVI. Interim Jugurtha postquam, 4 omissa deditione,
</p>
<p>bellum incipit, cum magna cura parare omnia, festinare,
</p>
<p>cogere exercitum : civitates, quae ab se defecerant, for-
</p>
<p>midine, aut ostentando praemia 5 adfectare : communire
</p>
<p>suos locos ; arma, tela, alia, quae spe pacis amiserat,
</p>
<p>reflcere, aut commercari : servitia Romanorum adlicere,
</p>
<p>et eos ipsos, qui in praesidiis erant, pecunia tentare .
</p>
<p>prorsus nihil intactum, neque quietum pati : cuncta agitare
</p>
<p>Igitur 6 Vagenses, quo Metellus initio, Jugurtha paciricante,
</p>
<p>praesidium imposuerat, fatigati regis suppliciis, neque
</p>
<p>antea voluntate alienati, principes civitatis inter se con-
</p>
<p>jurant : 7 nam volgus, uti plerumque solet, et maxume
</p>
<p>Numidarum, ingenio mobili, seditiosum atque 8 discordio-
</p>
<p>sum erat, cupidum novarum rerum, quieti et otio advor-
</p>
<p>sum. Dein, compositis inter se rebus, diem tertium con-
</p>
<p>stituunt, quod is, 9 festus celebratusque per omnem Africam,

<p>10 ludum et lasciviam magis, quam formidinem ostentabat.

</p>
<p>LXVII. Romani milites, improviso metu, incerti igna-
</p>

</p>
<p>pidi, ubi signa et scuta erant : praesidium hostium, portae

</p>
<p>que pro tectis aedirlciorum saxa, et alia, quae locus
</p>

</p>

<p>obtruncati. 3 In ea tanta asperitate, saevissumis Numidis
</p>
<p>et oppido undique clauso, Turpilius unus ex omnibus

<p>Italicis profugit intactus : id misericordiane hospitis, an

</p>
<p>quam plurimos potest, 5 Numidas equites, pariter cum

<p>efYusum oppido caedere ; alii ad portas festinare ; pars
</p>
<p>tiirris capere : ira atque praedae spes amplius, quam las-

<p>situdo posse. Ita Vagenses biduum modo 2 ex perfidia
</p>
<p>laetati : civitas magna et opulens poenae cuncta, ant

<p>praedae fuit. Turpilius quern, praefectum oppidi, unum

</p>

</p>
<p>pere ; ad perniciem ejus dolum quaerere ; diu noctuque
</p>
<p>6 fatigare animum : denique omnia tentando, socium sibi
</p>
<p>adjungit Nabdalsam, hominem nobilem, magnis opibus,
</p>
<p>carum acceptumque popularibus suis ; qui plerumque
</p>
<p>seorsum ab rege exercitum ductare, et omnis res exsequi
</p>
<p>solitus erat, quae Jugurthae fesso, aut majoribus adstricto
</p>
<p>superaverant : ex quo illi gloria opesque inventae. Igitui
</p>
<p>utriusque consilio dies insidiis statuitur : cetera, uti res
</p>
<p>posceret, ex tempore parari placuit. Nabdalsa ad exer-
</p>
<p>citum profectus, quern 7 inter hiberna Romanorum jussus
</p>
<p>habebat, ne ager, inultis hostibus, vastaretur. Is post-

<p>quam, magnitudine facinoris perculsus, ad tempus non

<p>epistolam, super caput in pulvino temere positam, sumit

</p>
<p>tatur " per amicitiam, perque sua antea fideliter acta, ne
</p>

</p>
<p>LXXIL Ad ea rex aliter, atque animo gerebat, placide
</p>
<p>respondit. Bomilcare aliisque multis, quos socios insidi-

<p>ex eo negotio seditio oriretur. Neque post id locorum

<p>Jugurthae dies aut nox ulla quieta fuere : neque loco,
</p>
<p>neque mortali cuiquam, aut tempori satis credere : civis,
</p>
<p>hostis juxta metuere : 4 circumspectare omnia, et omni
</p>
<p>strepitu pavescere : alio atque alio loco, saepe contra
</p>
<p>decus regium, noctu requiescere : interdum somno exci-

</p>
<p>sumas res pariter exspectant, 1 ignaviae voluptatem, et
</p>
<p>praemia virtutis. Atque etiam cum apud vos, aut in
</p>
<p>senatu verba faciunt, pleraque oratione majores suos ex-
</p>
<p>tollunt : eorum fortia facta memorando clariores sese pu-
</p>
<p>tant ; 2 quod contra est. Nam quanto vita illorum praecla-
</p>
<p>rior, tanto horum secordia flagitiosior. Et profecto ita
</p>
<p>se res habet : majorum gloria 3 posteris lumen est, neque
</p>
<p>bona neque mala in occulto patitur, Hujusce rei ego
</p>
<p>inopiam patior, Quirites ; verum id, quod multo praecla-
</p>
<p>rius est, meamet facta mihi dicere licet. Nunc videte,
</p>
<p>quam iniqui sint. Quod 4 ex aliena virtute sibi adrogant,
</p>
<p>id mihi ex mea non concedunt : scilicet, quia imagines
</p>
<p>non habeo, et quia mihi nova nobilitas est ; quam certe
</p>
<p>peperisse melius est, quam acceptam corrupisse. Equi-
</p>
<p>dem ego non ignoro, si jam respondere velint, 5 abunde
</p>
<p>illis facundam et compositam orationem fore. Sed 6 in
</p>
<p>maxumo vestro beneflcio, cam omnibus locis me vosque
</p>
<p>maledictis lacerent, non placuit reticere, ne quis modes-
</p>
<p>tiam in conscientiam duceret. Nam me quidem, 7 ex
</p>
<p>animi sententia, nulla oratio laedere potest : 8 quippe vera
</p>
<p>necesse est bene praedicet ; falsam vita moresque mei
</p>
<p>superant. Sed, quoniam 9 vestra consilia accusantur, qui
</p>
<p>mihi summum honorem, et maxumum negotium imposuis-

</p>
<p>Non possum 10 fidei caussa imagines, neque triumphos,

<p>hoc civile imperium. Namque, cum 3 tute per mollitiem

</p>
<p>histrionem ullum, neque pluris pretii coquum, quam

<p>parente meo, et ex 5 sanctis viris ita accepi, munditias
</p>
<p>mulieribus, viris laborem convenire, omnibusque bonis
</p>
<p>oportere plus gloriae, quam divitiarum : arma, non supel-

</p>
<p>quam plebis animos arrectos videt, propere commeatu,
</p>
<p>stipendio, armis, aliis utilibus navis onerat : cum bis A.
</p>
<p>Manlium legatum proficisci jubet. Ipse interea milites
</p>
<p>scribere, non more majormn, neque 5 ex classibus, sed uti
</p>
<p>cujusque lubido erat, 6 capite censos plerosque. Id factum
</p>

<p>et homini potentiam quaerenti egentissumus quisque op-

<p>Marius cum majore aliquanto numero, quam decretum

<p>Metellus conspectum Marii fugerat, ne videret ea, quae

</p>
<p>reges, ubi de adventu Marii cognoverunt, a divorsi in locos
</p>
<p>difficilis abeunt. Ita Jugurthae placuerat, speranti, mox
</p>
<p>effusos hostis invadi posse ; Romanos, sicuti plerosque,
</p>
<p>remoto metu, laxius licentiusque futures.
</p>
<p>LXXXYIII. Metellxjs interea Romam profectus, con-
</p>
<p>tra spem suam, 2 laetissumis animis excipitur ; plebi pa-
</p>
<p>tribusque, postquam invidia decesserat, juxta carus. Sed
</p>
<p>Marius impigre prudenterque suorum et hostium res pari-
</p>
<p>ir adtendere : cognoscere quid boni utrisque, aut contra
</p>
<p>esset : explorare itinera regum, consilia et insidias ante-
</p>
<p>venire : 3 nihil apud se remissum, neque apud illos tutum
</p>
<p>pati : Itaque et Gaetulos, et Jugurtham, ex sociis nostris
</p>
<p>praedam agentes, saepe adgressus itinere fuderat, ipsum-
</p>
<p>que regem haud procul ab oppido Cirta 4 armis exuerat.
</p>
<p>Quae postquam gloriosa modo, neque 5 belli patrandi
</p>
<p>cognovit, statuit urbis, quae viris aut loco 6 pro hostibus,
</p>
<p>et advorsum se opportunissumae erant, singulas circum-
</p>
<p>venire : ita Jugurtham aut praesidiis nudatum, si ea
</p>
<p>pateretur, aut praelio certaturum. Nam Bocchus nuncios
</p>
<p>ad eum saepe miserat, " velle populi Romani amicitiam ;
</p>
<p>ne quid ab se hostile timeret." Id simulaveritne, 7 quo
</p>
<p>improvisus gravior ac cider et, an mobilitate ingenii pacem
</p>
<p>atque bellum mutare solitus, parum exploratum.

<p>LXXXIX. Sed consul, uti statuerat, oppida castellaque

</p>
<p>tando avortere ab hostibus. Ac primo 8 mediocria gerebat,
</p>
<p>existumans, Jugurtham ob suos tutandos in manus ventu-

</p>
<p>pido propinqua, alia omnia vasta, inculta, egentia aquae.
</p>
<p>Hnfesta serpentibus : 2 quarum vis, sicuti omnium feranim,
</p>
<p>inopia cibi acrior : ad hoc natura serpentium, ipsa per
</p>
<p>niciosa, siti magis, quam alia re, accenditur. Ejus po-
</p>
<p>tiundi Marium maxuma cupido invaserat, cum propter
</p>
<p>3 usum belli, turn quia res aspera videbatur ; et Metellus
</p>
<p>oppidum Thalam magna gloria ceperat, haud dissimiliter
</p>
<p>situm munitumque ; nisi quod apud Thalam haud longe
</p>
<p>a moenibus aliquot fontes erant, Capsenses una modo,
</p>
<p>atque ea intra oppidum, 4 jugi aqua, cetera pluvia utebantur.
</p>
<p>Id ibique, et 5 in omni Africa, quae procul a mari incul-
</p>
<p>tius agebat, eo facilius tolerabatur, quia Numidae pie-
</p>
<p>rumque lacte et ferina carne vescebantur, neque 6 salem,
</p>
<p>neque alia irritamenta gulae quaerebant ; cibus 7 illis advor-
</p>
<p>sum famem atque sitim, non lubidini, neque luxuriae erat.
</p>
<p>XC. Igitur consul, omnibus exploratis, credo, dis fre-
</p>
<p>tus ; nam contra tantas difhcultates consilio satis provi-
</p>
<p>dere non poterat ; quippe etiam frumenti inopia 8 tentaba-
</p>
<p>tur, quod Numidae pabulo pecoris, magis, quam arvo
</p>
<p>studont, et quodcumque natum fuerat, jussu regis in loca
</p>
<p>munita contulerant, ager autem aridus et frugum vacuus ea
</p>
<p>tempestate, nam aestatis extremum erat ; tamen 9 pro rei co-
</p>
<p>pia satis providenter exornat : pecus omne, quod superiori-
</p>
<p>bus diebus praedae fuerat, equitibus auxiliariis agendum
</p>
<p>adtribuit : A. Manlium legatum cum cohortibus expeditis ad
</p>
<p>oppidum Laris, ubi stipendium et commeatum lo caver at, ire
</p>
<p>jubet ; 10 se praedabundum post paucos dies eodem ventu-

</p>
<p>visum, castris egreditur, noctemque totam itinere facto
</p>
<p>consedit : idem ^roxuma facit : dein tertia, multo ante
</p>
<p>lucis adventum, pervenit in locum tumulosum, ab Capsa
</p>
<p>non amplius duum millium intervallo ; ibique, quam occul-
</p>
<p>lissume potest, cum omnibus copiis opperitur. Sed, ubi
</p>
<p>dies coepit, et Numidae, nihil hostile metuentes, multi
</p>
<p>oppido egressi ; repente omnem equitatum, et cum his
</p>
<p>velocissumos pedites cursu tendere ad Capsam, et portas
</p>
<p>obsidere jubet : deinde ipse intentus propere sequi, ne-
</p>
<p>que milites praedari sinere. Quae postquam oppidani
</p>
<p>cognovere ; 2 res trepidae, metus ingens, malum impro-
</p>
<p>visum, ad hoc pars civium extra moenia in hostium po-
</p>
<p>testate, coegere, uti deditionem facerent. Ceterum oppi-
</p>
<p>dum incensum : Numidae puberes interfecti ; alii omnes
</p>
<p>venum dati : praeda militibus divisa. 3 Id facinus contra
</p>
<p>jus belli, non avaritia, neque scelere consulis admissum ;
</p>
<p>sed quia locus Jugurthae opportunus, nobis aditu difEcilis,
</p>
<p>genus hominum mobile, infidum, neque beneficio, neque
</p>
<p>metu coercitum.
</p>
<p>XCIL Postquam tantam rem Marius, sine ullo suo-
</p>
<p>rum incommodo patravit ; magnus et clarus antea, major
</p>
<p>et clarior haberi coepit. 4 Omnia, non bene consulta
</p>
<p>modo, verum etiam casu data, in virtutem trahebantur :
</p>
<p>milites, 5 modesto imperio habiti simul, et locupletes, ad
</p>
<p>coelum ferre : Numidae magis, quam mortalem timere :
</p>
<p>postremo omnes socii atque hostes credere illi aut men-
</p>
<p>tern divinam, aut deorum nutu cuncta portendi. Sed
</p>
<p>consul, ubi ea res bene evenit, ad alia oppida pergit :
</p>
<p>pauca, repugnantibus Numidis, capit ; plura 6 deserta, prop-
</p>
<p>ter Capsensium miserias, igni corrumpit : luctu atque
</p>
<p>caede omnia complentur. Denique, multis locis potitus,

<p>s non eadem asperitate, qua Capsensium, ceterum haud
</p>
<p>secus difficilem. Namque haud longe a flumine Mulucha,
</p>
<p>quod Jugurthae Bocchique regnum disjungebat, erat 9 inter

<p>ceteram planitiem mons saxeus, mediocri castello satis

<p>patens, in immensum editus, uno perangusto aditu relicto :
</p>
<p>nam Jomnis natura, velut opere atque consulto, praeceps
</p>
<p>Quern locum Marios, quod ibi regis thesauri erant, sum
</p>
<p>ma vi capere intendit. Sed ea res forte, quam consilio.
</p>
<p>melius gesta. Nam castello virorum atque armorum sa-
</p>
<p>tis, magna vis frumenti et fons aquae ; aggeribus turri-
</p>
<p>busque et aliis machinationibus locus 2 importunus : iter
</p>
<p>eastellanorum angustum admodum, utrimque praecisum.
</p>
<p>Vineae cum ingenti periculo frustra agitabantur : nam,
</p>
<p>cum eae paullum processerant, igni, aut lapidibus cor-
</p>
<p>rumpebantur ; milites neque 3 pro opere consistere, propter
</p>
<p>iniquitatem loci, neque intra Tineas sine periculo 4 ad-
</p>
<p>ministrare : optumus quisque cadere, aut sauciari ; ceteris
</p>
<p>metus augeri.
</p>
<p>XCIII. At Marius, multis diebus et laboribus consumtis,
</p>
<p>6 anxius trahere cum animo, omitteretne inceptum quo-
</p>
<p>niam frustra erat, an fortunam opperiretur, qua saepe
</p>
<p>prospere usus. Quae cum multos dies, noctes, 6 aestuans
</p>
<p>agitaret, forte quidam Ligus, ex cohortibus auxiliariis
</p>
<p>miles gregarius, castris aquatum egressus, haud procul
</p>
<p>ab latere castelli, quod 7 avorsum praeliantibus erat, ani-
</p>
<p>mum advortit inter saxa repentis cochleas : quarum cum
</p>
<p>unam atque alteram, dein plures peteret, studio legundi
</p>
<p>paullatim prope ad summum montis egressus est. Ubi ;
</p>
<p>postquam 8 solitudinem intellexit, more humani ingenii,
</p>
<p>cupido ignara visundi invadit. Et forte in eo loco grandis
</p>
<p>ilex coaluerat inter saxa, 9 paullulum modo prona, dein
</p>
<p>flexa atque aucta in altitudinem, quo cuncta gignentium
</p>
<p>natura fert : cujus ramis modo, modo eminentibus saxis
</p>
<p>nisus Ligus, i0 castelli planitiem perscribit : quod cuncti
</p>
<p>Numidae intenti praeliantibus aderant. Exploratis omni-

<p>ciens. Itaque Marium propere adit, acta edocet, hortatur,-
</p>
<p>ab ea parte, qua ipse escenderat, castellum tentet : pol-
</p>
<p>licetur sese itineris periculique due em. Marius cum

<p>Li^ure, promissa cognitum, 12 ex praesentibus misit : quo-

</p>
<p>rum uti cujusque ingenium erat, ita rem difficilem aui
</p>
<p>facilem nunciavere. Consulis animus tamen paullum
</p>
<p>arrectus. Itaque ex copia Hubicinum et cornicinum, nu-
</p>
<p>mero quinque quam velocissumos delegit, et cum his,
</p>
<p>praesidio qui forent, quatuor centuriones : omnis Liguri
</p>
<p>parere jubet, et ei negotio proxumum diem constituit.
</p>
<p>XCIV. Sed, ubi 2 ex praecepto tempus visum, paratis
</p>
<p>compositisque omnibus, ad locum pergit. Ceterum illi

<p>qui centuriis praeerant, praedocti ab duce, arma ornatum-

<p>uti reges praeceperant, 2 noctem pro se rati, acrius instare.
</p>
<p>Turn Marius ex copia rerum consilium trahit, atque, uti

<p>suis receptui locus esset, collis duos propinquos inter se

<p>occupat : quorum in uno, castris parum amplo, fons aquae
</p>
<p>magnus erat ; alter usui opportunus, quia, magna parte

</p>
<p>apud aquam Sullam cum equitibus noctem 4 agitare jubet

<p>Ipse paullatim dispersos milites, neque minus hostibus

<p>conturbatis, in unum contrahit ; dein cunctos 5 pleno gradu
</p>
<p>in collem subducit. Ita reges, loci difficultate coacti.
</p>
<p>praelio deterrentur ; neque tamen suos longius abire
</p>
<p>sinunt, sed, utroque colle multitudine circumdato, 6 efTusi
</p>
<p>consedere. Dein crebris ignibus factis, plerumque noctis
</p>
<p>barbari suo more laetari, exsultare, strepere vocibus :

<p>CV. Quis rebus cognitis, Bocchus per litteras a Mario

<p>praemissi, 9 rem, uti erat, quietam nunciant.

<p>Deinde eum et proxumum diem sine metu conjuncti eunt

<p>CVII. At Sulla, quanquam eadem aestumabat, tamen
</p>
<p>ab injuria Maurum 3 probibet : suos hortatur, " uti fortem

</p>
<p>ceret, maxumum Jovem obtestatus, ut sceleris atque per-

<p>fidiae Bocchi testis adesset, castris abire jubet. Ille lacru-

<p>5 lubidinem advorsum nos, metum pro nobis suasisse.
</p>
<p>CIX. Igitur Sulla respondit : " pauca se coram Aspare
</p>
<p>locuturum ; cetera occulte, aut nullo, aut quam paucissu-
</p>

</p>
<p>Postquam, sicuti voluerat, congressi, dicit, " se missum a

</p>
<p>Sed, ubi plerumque noctis processit, Sulla a Boccho

<p>occulte arcessitur : ab utroque tantummodo fidi interpretes
</p>
<p>adhibentur : praeterea Dabar 8 internuncius, sanctus vir et

<p>CX. " Numquam ego ratus sum fore, uti rex maxumus

<p>CXI. Ad ea Sulla pro se breviter et modice ; de pace
</p>
<p>et de communibus rebus multis disseruit. Denique regi

<p>patefacit, 2 quod polliceatur, senatum et populum Roma-

<p>num, quoniam amplius armis valuissent, non in gratiam
</p>
<p>habituros : faciundum aliquid, quod illorum magis, quam

<p>sua, retulisse videretur : 3 id adeo in promtu esse, quo-
</p>
<p>niam Jugurthae copiam haberet : quern si Romanis tradi-
</p>
<p>disset, fore, uti illi plurimum deberetur ; amicitiam, foedus,
</p>
<p>Numidiae partem, quam nunc peter et, ultro adventuram."
</p>
<p>Rex primo 4 negitare : " adfinitatem, cognationem, prae-
</p>
<p>terea foedus intervenisse : ad hoc metuere, ne 5 fluxa fide
</p>
<p>usus, popularium animos avorteret, quis et Jugurtba cams,
</p>
<p>et Romani invisi erant." Denique saepius fatigatus,
</p>
<p>6 lenitur et ex voluntate Sullae omnia se facturum pro-
</p>
<p>mittit. Ceterum 7 ad simulandam pacem, cujus Numida,
</p>
<p>defessus bello, avidissumus, quae utilia visa, constituunt.
</p>
<p>Ita composito dolo digrediuntur.
</p>
<p>CXII. At rex postero die Asparem, Jugurthae legatum
</p>
<p>adpellat : " sibi per Dabarem ex Sulla cognitum, 8 posse
</p>
<p>conditionibus bellum poni : quamobrem regis sui senten-

</p>
<p>Deinde ab illo cuncta edoctus, properato itinere, post

<p>Sed plerumque regiae voluntates, ut vehementes, sic mo-

<p>loco 2 constituto, Bocchus Sullam modo, modo Jugurthae

<p>ceri. Illi pariter laeti, ac spei bonae pleni. Sed nocte

</p>
<p>occulta pectoris 6 patefecisse. Tamen postremo Sullam
</p>
<p>arcessiri jubet, et ex ejus sententia Numidae insidias
</p>
<p>tendit. Deinde, ubi dies advenit, et ei nunciatum est,
</p>
<p>Jugurtham haud procul abesse, cum paucis amicis et

<p>7 quaestore nostro, quasi obvius honoris caussa, procedit

<p>in tumulum, facillumum visu insidiantibus. Eodem Nu-

<p>accedit ; ac statim, signo dato, undique simul ex insidiis
</p>
<p>invaditur. Ceteri obtruncati : Jugurtha Sullae vinctus

<p>traditur, et ab eo 9 ad Marium deductus.

<p>sita : 4 aniini imperio, corporis servitio, magis utimur : al-

<p>5 Quo mihi rectius videtur ingenii quam virium opibus

<p>regum atque imperatorum animi virtus in pace ita, uti in
</p>
<p>bello, valeret, aequabilius atque constantius sese rea
</p>
<p>humanae haberent ; neque 2 aliud alio ferri, neque mutari
</p>
<p>ac misceri omnia cerneres. Nam imperium facile his
</p>
<p>artibus retinetur, quibus initio partum est. Verum, ubi
</p>
<p>3 pro labore desidia, pro continentia et aequitate lubido
</p>
<p>atque superbia invasere, fortuna simul cum moribus im-

<p>mutatur. Ita imperium semper ad 4 optumum quemque a

<p>dediti ventri atque somno, indocti incultique vitam, sicuti

<p>rerum, aliud alii natura iter ostendit.
</p>
<p>III. Pulchrum est bene facere reipublicae : etiam 9 bene
</p>
<p>dicere haud absurdum est. Vel pace, vel bello, clarum
</p>
<p>fieri licet ; 10 et qui fecere, et qui facta aliorum scripsere,
</p>
<p>multi laudantur. Ac mihi quidem, tamen etsi haud-

<p>quaquam par gloria sequatur scriptorem et n auctorem
</p>
<p>rerum, tamen in primis arduum videtur res gestas scri-

<p>hinc, quia plerique, quae delicta reprehenderis, malivo-

</p>
<p>atque habuere initio 2 Trojani, qui, Aenea duce, profugi,
</p>
<p>sedibus incertis vagabantur ; cumque his 3 Aborigines,
</p>

</p>
<p>aucta, satis prospera, satisque pollens videbatur ; sicuti
</p>
<p>pleraque mortalium habentur, invidia ex opulentia orta est.
</p>
<p>Igitur reges populique rmitimi bello 7 tentare : pauci ex
</p>
<p>amicis auxilio esse ; nam ceteri, metu 8 perculsi, a pe-
</p>
<p>riculis aberant. At Romani, domi militiaeque intend,
</p>
<p>festinare, parare, alius alium hortari ; hostibus obviam ire ;
</p>
<p>libertatem, patriam parentesque armis tegere : post, ubi
</p>
<p>pericula virtute propulerant, sociis atque amicis auxilia
</p>
<p>portabant ; magisque dandis quam accipiundis beneficiis,
</p>
<p>amicitias parabant. 9 Imperium legitimum, nomen imperii
</p>
<p>regium habebant : delecti, quibus corpus annis infirmum,
</p>
<p>ingenium sapientia validum, reipublicae consultabant : hi,
</p>
<p>10 vel aetate, vel curae similitudine, Patres appellabantur.
</p>
<p>Post, ubi regium imperium, quod, initio, n conservandae

<p>habebant. Igitur talibus viris non 1 labos insolitus, non
</p>
<p>locus ullus asper, aut arduus erat, non armatus hostis
</p>
<p>formidolosus : virtus omnia domuerat. Sed gloriae maxu-
</p>
<p>mum certamen inter ipsos erat : 2 sese quisque hostem
</p>
<p>ferire, murum adscendere, conspici dum tale facinus
</p>
<p>faceret, properabat : 3 eas divitias, earn bonam famam
</p>
<p>magnamque nobilitatem putabant : laudis avidi, pecuniae
</p>
<p>liberales erant : gloriam ingentem, divitias honestas vole-
</p>

</p>
<p>VIII. Sed profecto Fortuna in omni re dominatur ; ea

<p>6 res cunctas, ex lubidine magis quam ex vero, celebrat
</p>
<p>obscuratque. Atheniensium res gestae, sicuti ego aestu-
</p>
<p>mo, satis amplae magnificaeque fuere ; verum aliquanto
</p>
<p>minores tamen, quam fama feruntur. Sed, quia provenere
</p>
<p>ibi 6 scriptorum magna ingenia, per t err arum orb em Athe-
</p>
<p>niensium facta pro maxumis celebrantur. Ita eorum qui
</p>
<p>fecere virtus tanta habetur, quantum verbis 7 eam potuere
</p>
<p>extollere praeclara ingenia. At populo Romano nunquam
</p>
<p>ea copia fuit : quia 8 prudentissumus quisque negotiosus
</p>
<p>maxume erat ; ingenium nemo sine corpore exercebat ;
</p>
<p>& optumus quisque facere, quam dicere ; sua ab aliis bene-
</p>
<p>facta laudari, quam ipse aliorum narrare, malebat.

</p>
<p>dubias atque asperas res facile toleraverant, iis otium,
</p>
<p>divitiae 5 optandae aliis, oneri miseriaeque fuere. Igitur
</p>
<p>primo pecuniae, deinde imperii cupido crevit: ea quasi
</p>
<p>6 materies omnium malorum fuere. Namque avaritia fldem,
</p>
<p>probitatem, ceterasque artis bonas subvertit ; pro his,
</p>
<p>superbiam, crudelitatem, deos neglegere, omnia venalia
</p>
<p>habere, edocuit : ambitio multos mcrtalis 7 falsos fieri
</p>
<p>subegit; aliud clausum in pectore, aliud in lingua prom-
</p>
<p>turn habere ; amicitias inimicitiasque, non 8 ex re, sed
</p>
<p>ex commodo, aestumare ; magisque vultum, quam inge-

<p>sacra profanaque omnia polluere. Igitur hi milites, post-
</p>
<p>quam victoriam adepti sunt, nihil reliqui victis fecere.
</p>
<p>Quippe secundae res sapientium animos 3 fatigant : ne illi,
</p>
<p>corruptis moribus, victoriae temperarent.
</p>
<p>XII. Postquam divitiae honori coepere, et eas gloria,

<p>imperium, potentia sequebatur ; hebescere virtus, pau-
</p>
<p>pertas probro haberi, 4 innocentia pro malivolentia duci
</p>

</p>
<p>parvi pendere, aliena cupere ; 6 pudorem, pudicitiam, di

</p>
<p>nabere. Operae pretium est, quum domos atque villas
</p>
<p>cognoveris in urbium modum exaedificatas, visere templa
</p>
<p>deorum, quae nostri majores, religiosissumi mortales,
</p>
<p>fecere. 7 Verum illi delubra deorum pietate, domos sua
</p>
<p>gloria decorabant ; neque victis quidquam, 8 praeter inju-
</p>
<p>riae licentiam, eripiebant. At hi contra, ignavissumi
</p>
<p>homines, per sumraura scelus, omnia ea sociis adimere.
</p>
<p>quae fortissumi viri 9 victores rehquerant : proinde quasi

<p>XIV. 1 In tanta tamque corrupta civitate, Catilina, id
</p>
<p>quod factu facillumum erat, omnium 2 flagitiorum atque
</p>
<p>facinorum circum se, tamquam stipatorum, catervas habe-
</p>
<p>bat. Nam, quicumque impudicus, adulter, bona patria
</p>
<p>laceraverat ; quique alienum aes grande conflaverat, 3 quo
</p>
<p>flagitium aut facinus redimeret ; praeterea, omnes undi-
</p>
<p>que parricidae, sacrilegi, 4 convicti judiciis, aut pro factis
</p>
<p>judicium timentes ; ad hoc, 5 quos manus atque lingua per-
</p>
<p>jurio aut sanguine civili alebat ; postremo, omnes quos
</p>
<p>flagitium, egestas, conscius animus exagitabat ; ii Catili-
</p>
<p>nae 6 proxumi familiaresque erant. Quod si quis etiam a
</p>
<p>culpa vacuus in amicitiam ejus 7 inciderat, quotidiano usu
</p>
<p>atque illecebris facile 8 par similisque ceteris efiiciebatur.
</p>
<p>Sed maxume adolescentium familiaritates adpetebat :
</p>
<p>eorum animi molles et 9 aetate fluxi, doHs haud difficulter
</p>
<p>capiebantur. Nam, uti cujusque studium ex aetate flagra-
</p>
<p>bat, aliis scorta praebere ; aliis canes atque equos mer-
</p>
<p>cari ; postremo, neque sumtui, neque 10 modestiae suae
</p>
<p>parcere, dum illos n obnoxios fidosque faceret.
</p>
<p>XV. Jam primum adolescens Catilina multa nefanda
</p>
<p>stupra fecerat ; 12 cum virgine nobili, cum 13 sacerdote Ves-
</p>
<p>tae, alia hujuscemodi contra 14 jus fasque. Postremo,
</p>
<p>captus amore 15 Aureliae Orestillae, cujus, praeter formam,
</p>
<p>nihil unquam bonus laudavit ; quod ea 16 nubere illi dubi-
</p>

</p>
<p>tur, 18 necato flrio, 19 vacuam domum scelestis nuptiis

<p>fuisse facinoris maturandi. Namque animus impurus,

<p>20 dis hominibusque infestus, neque vigiliis, neque quieti-

<p>SALLUSTII CATILIXA. 91
</p>
<p>XXII. Fuere ea tempestate, qui dicerent, Catilinam,
</p>
<p>oratione habita, cum ad jusjurandum popularis sceleris
</p>
<p>sui adigeret, ^umani corporis sanguinem, vino permix-
</p>
<p>tum, in pateris circumtulisse ; 2 inde cum post exsecra-
</p>
<p>tionem omnes degustavissent, sicuti in solemnibus sacris
</p>
<p>fieri consuevit, aperuisse consilium suum, 3 atque eo, dicti-
</p>
<p>tare, fecisse, quo inter se fidi magis forent, 4 alius alii
</p>
<p>tanti facinoris conscii. Nonnulli ficta haec, multa prae-
</p>
<p>terea, existumabant, ab iis, qui 5 Ciceronis invidiam, quae
</p>
<p>postea orta est, leniri credebant atrocitate sceleris eorum,
</p>
<p>qui poenas dederant. Nobis ea res 6 pro magnitudine
</p>
<p>parum comperta est.
</p>
<p>XXIII. Sed in ea conventione fuit Q. Curius, natus
</p>
<p>haud obscuro loco, flagitiis atque facinoribus coopertus ;
</p>
<p>quern censores senatu, probri gratia, 7 amoverant. Huic
</p>
<p>homini non minor 8 vanitas, quam audacia : neque reti-
</p>
<p>cere, quae audierat, neque suamet ipse scelera occultare :
</p>
<p>9 prorsus neque dicere, neque facere, quidquam pensi ha-
</p>
<p>bebat. Erat ei cum Fulvia, muliere nobili, 10 vetus con-
</p>
<p>suetudo : cui cum minus gratus esset, quia inopia minus
</p>
<p>largiri poterat, repente glorians n maria montesque polli-
</p>
<p>ceri coepit ; minari interdum ferro, nisi 12 obnoxia foret ;
</p>
<p>postremo ferocius agitare, quam solitus erat. At Fulvia,
</p>
<p>13 insolentiae Curii caussa cognita, tale periculum reipub-
</p>
<p>licae haud occultum habuit ; sed, 14 sublato auctore, de
</p>
<p>Catilinae conjuratione quae quoque modo audierat, com-
</p>
<p>pluribus narravit. Ea res imprimis studia hominum ac-
</p>
<p>cendit ad consulatum mandandum 15 M. Tullio Ciceroni.
</p>
<p>Namque antea 16 pleraque nobilitas invidia aestuabat, et
</p>
<p>quasi pollui consulatum 17 credebant, si eum, quam vis
</p>
<p>egregius, 18 homo novus adeptus foret. Sed, ubi periculum
</p>
<p>advenit, invidia atque superbia 19 postfuere.

<p>M. Tullius et C. Antonius ; quod factum primo 20 popularis
</p>
<p>conjurationis concusserat. Neque tamen Catilinae furor
</p>
<p>minuebatur : sed in dies plura agitare ; arma per Italiam
</p>
<p>locis opportunis parare ; pecuniam, sua aut amicorum

</p>
<p>fide 1 sumtam mutuam, Faesulas ad 2 Manlium quemdam
</p>
<p>portare, qui postea 3 princeps fuit belli faciundi. Ea tem-
</p>
<p>pestate plurimos cujusque generis homines 4 adscivisse
</p>
<p>dicitur : mulieres etiam aliquot, 5 quae, ubi aetas tantum-
</p>
<p>modo quaestui, neque luxuriae, modum fecerat, aes
</p>
<p>alienum grande conflaverant : per eas se Catilina crede-
</p>
<p>bat posse 6 servitia urbana sollicitare, urbem incendere,
</p>
<p>viros earum vel adjungere sibi, vel interficere.
</p>
<p>XXV. Sed in his erat 7 Sempronia, quae multa saepe
</p>
<p>8 virilis audaciae facinora commiserat. Haec mulier
</p>
<p>genere atque forma, praeterea 9 viro, liberis satis fortu-
</p>
<p>nata ; litteris Graecis atque Latinis docta ; 10 psallere, sal-
</p>
<p>tare n elegantius, quam necesse est probae ; multa alia,
</p>
<p>quae 12 instrumenta luxuriae. Sed ei cariora semper
</p>
<p>omnia, quam decus atque pudicitia fuit : pecuniae an
</p>
<p>famae minus parceret, haud facile decerneres. Sed ea
</p>
<p>saepe antehac fidem prodiderat, 13 creditum abjuraverat,
</p>
<p>caedis conscia fuerat, luxuria atque inopia praeceps abie
</p>
<p>rat. 14 Verum ingenium ejus haud absurdum : posse ver-
</p>
<p>sus facere, jocum movere, sermone uti vel modesto, vel
</p>
<p>molli, vel procaci : prorsus multae 15 facetiae multusque
</p>
<p>lepos inerat.
</p>
<p>XXVI. His rebus comparatis, Catilina nihilo minus in
</p>
<p>proxumum annum consulatum petebat ; sperans, si ^de-
</p>
<p>signates foret, facile se ex voluntate Antonio usurum.
</p>
<p>Neque interea quietus erat, sed omnibus modis insidias
</p>
<p>parabat Ciceroni. Neque illi tamen ad cavendum 17 dolus,
</p>
<p>aut astutiae deerant. Namque, a principio consulates sui,
</p>
<p>multa 18 pollicendo per Fulviam, effecerat, ut Q. Curius,
</p>
<p>de quo paullo ante memoravi, consilia Catilinae sibi
</p>
<p>proderet. Ad hoc, collegam suum Antonium 19 pac-
</p>
<p>tione provinciae perpulerat, 20 ne contra rempublicam
</p>
<p>sentiret ; circum se praesidia amicorum atque 21 clientium

<p>quoniam quae occulte tentaverat, a aspera foedaque eve-
</p>
<p>nerant.
</p>
<p>XXVII. Igitur C. Manlium Faesulas atque in earn
</p>
<p>partem Etruriae, Septimium quemdam, Camertem, in
</p>
<p>agrum Picenum, 2 C. Julium in Apuliam dimisit ; prae-
</p>
<p>terea alium alio, 3 quem ubique opportunum credebat. In-
</p>
<p>terea Romae multa simul moliri : consuli insidias tendere,
</p>
<p>parare incendia, opportuna loca armatis hominibus 4 obsi-
</p>
<p>dere : ipse 5 cum telo esse, 6 item alios jubere : hortari,
</p>
<p>uti semper intenti paratique essent : dies noctesque 7 fes-
</p>
<p>tinare, vigilare, neque insomniis neque labore fatigari.
</p>
<p>Postremo, ubi multa agitanti nihil procedit, rursus 8 intem-
</p>
<p>pesta nocte conjurationis principes convocat per 9 M.
</p>
<p>Porcium Laecam : ibique, multa de ignavia eorum ques-
</p>
<p>tus, docet, " se Manlium praemisisse ad earn multitudinem,
</p>
<p>quam ad capiunda anna paraverat ; item alios in alia

</p>
<p>citum proficisci cupere, si prius Ciceronem oppressisset :
</p>
<p>eum suis consiliis multum obficere."
</p>
<p>XXVIII. Igitur, perterritis ac dubitantibus ceteris,

<p>10 C. Cornelius, eques Romanus, operam suam pollicitus,
</p>
<p>et cum eo L. Vargunteius, senator, constituere ]1 ea nocte
</p>
<p>paullo post, cum armatis hominibus, 12 sicuti salutatum,
</p>
<p>introire ad Ciceronem, ac de improviso domi suae im-
</p>
<p>paratum confodere. Curius, ubi 13 intellegit quantum
</p>
<p>periculi consuli impendeat, propere per Fulviam, dolum

<p>qui parabatur enunciat. Ita illi, janua prohibit], tantum

<p>XXIX. Ea cum Ciceroni nunciarentur, 16 ancipiti malo

</p>
<p>quo consilio foret, satis compertum habebat, 1 rem ad
</p>
<p>senatum refert, jam ante a 2 volgi rumoribus exagitatam.
</p>
<p>Itaque, quod plerumque 3 in atroci negotio solet, senatus
</p>
<p>decrevit, darent operam consules, ne quid respubli-
</p>
<p>ca d-etrimenti caperet. 4 Ea potestas per senatum,

<p>parare, bellum gerere, coercere omnibus modis socios

<p>atque civis ; domi militiaeque >5 imperium atque judicium
</p>
<p>summum habere : aliter, sine populi jussu, 6 nulli earum

<p>rerum consuli jus est.

</p>

</p>
<p>quibus scriptum erat, C. Manlium arma cepisse, cum
</p>
<p>magna multitudine, 8 ante diem sextum Kalendas Novem-

<p>suo videbatur facere. Nam semper in civitate, 3 quis ope3

</p>

</p>
<p>tremo omnes quos flagitium aut faeinus domo expulerat *
</p>

</p>
<p>multi memores Sullanae victoriae, quod ex gregariis
</p>
<p>militibus alios senatores videbant, alios ita divites, uti
</p>
<p>9 regio victu atque cultu aetatem agerent, sibi quisque,
</p>
<p>si in armis forent, ex victoria talia sperabant. Praeterea,

</p>
<p>men animos eorum arrexit. Quod si primo praelio Cati-

<p>magna clades atque calamitas rempublicam oppressisset,
</p>
<p>neque illis, qui victoriam adepti, diutius ea uti licuisset,
</p>
<p>quin defessis et 13 exsanguibus, qui plus posset, imperium

<p>atque libertatem extorqueret. Fuere tamen 14 extra con-
</p>
<p>jurationem complures, qui ad Catilinam initio profecti
</p>
<p>sunt : in his 15 A. Fulvius, senatoris filius ; quern, re-
</p>
<p>tractum ex itinere, 16 parens necari jussit. Isdem tem-

</p>
<p>Umbrenus, quod in Gallia 17 negotiatus, plerisque 18 princi-

</p>
<p>de statu civitatis, et quasi dolens ejus casum, requireio
</p>
<p>coepit, " quern exitum tantis malis sperarent ?" Postquam
</p>
<p>illos l videt " queri de avaritia magistratuum, accusare se-
</p>
<p>natum quod in eo auxilii nihil esset ; miseriis suis reme-
</p>
<p>dium mortem exspectare :" " at ego," inquit, " vobis, 2 si
</p>
<p>modo viri esse voltis, rationem ostendam, qua tanta ista
</p>
<p>mala effugiatis." Haec ubi dixit, Allobroges in maxu-
</p>
<p>mam spem adducti Umbrenum orare, uti sui misereretur :
</p>
<p>nihil tarn asperum, neque tarn difficile, 3 quin cupidissume
</p>
<p>facturi essent, dum ea res civitatem aere alieno liberaret.
</p>
<p>Ille eos in domum D. Bruti perducit ; quod foro propin-
</p>
<p>qua, neque aliena eonsilii, propter Semproniam ; nam turn
</p>
<p>Brutus 4 ab Roma aberat. Praeterea Gabinium arcessit,
</p>
<p>5 quo major auctoritas sermoni inesset : eo praesente con-
</p>
<p>jurationem aperit ; nominat socios, praeterea multos
</p>
<p>cujusque generis 6 innoxios, quo legatis animus amplior
</p>
<p>esset ; dein eos pollicitos operam suam dimittit.
</p>
<p>XLI. Sed Allobroges diu in incerto habuere, quidnam
</p>
<p>eonsilii caperent. In altera parte erat aes alienum, stu
</p>
<p>dium belli, magna merces in spe victoriae : at in altera
</p>
<p>7 majores opes, tuta consilia, pro incerta spe, certa prae-
</p>
<p>mia. Haec illis volventibus, tandem vicit fortuna rei-
</p>
<p>publicae. Itaque Q. Fabio Sangae, cujus 8 patrocinio
</p>
<p>civitas plurimum utebatur, rem omnem, uti cognoverant,
</p>
<p>aperiunt. Cicero, per Sangam 9 consilio cognito, legatis
</p>
<p>praecipit, studium conjurationis vehementer simulent, cet-
</p>
<p>eros adeant, 10 bene polliceantur ; dentque operam, uti eos

<p>quam maxume manifestos habeant.

</p>
<p>eum vi adgrederetur, 10 alius autem alium : sed n nlii
</p>
<p>familiarum, quorum ex nobilitate maxuma pars, parentes
</p>
<p>interne erent ; simul, caede et incendio perculsis omnibus,
</p>
<p>ad Catilinam erumperent. Inter haec 12 parata atque de-
</p>
<p>creta, Cethegus semper querebatur de ignavia sociorum :
</p>
<p>illos dubitando et 13 dies prolatando magnas opportunitates
</p>
<p>corrumpere ; facto, non consulto, in tali pericnlo opus
</p>
<p>esse ; seque, si pauci adjuvarent, languentibus aliis, im-
</p>
<p>petum in curiam facturum. Natura ferox, vehemens,
</p>
<p>manu promtus, maxumum bonum in celeritate putabat.

</p>
<p>hendant : rem omnem aperit, cujus gratia mittebantur :
</p>
<p>6 cetera, uti facto opus sit, ita agant, permittit. 7 Homines
</p>
<p>militares, sine tumultu 8 praesidiis collocatis, sicuti prae-
</p>
<p>ceptum erat, occulte pontem obsidunt. Postquam ad id
</p>
<p>loci legati cum Volturcio venere, et simul utrimque
</p>
<p>clamor exortus est ; Galli, 9 cito cognito consilio, sine

<p>mora praetoribus se tradunt. Yolturcius primo, cohorta-

<p>legatis desertus est, 10 multa prius de salute sua Pomtinum
</p>
<p>obtestatus, quod ei notus erat, postremo timidus, ac vitae
</p>
<p>diffidens, veluti hostibus, sese praetoribus dedit.

<p>Nam si digna poena pro factis eorum reperitur, 9 novum

<p>Equidem ego sic aestumo, Patres conscripti, omnis cru-
</p>
<p>ciatus minores, quam facinora illorum, esse : sed plerique
</p>
<p>mortales postrema meminere, et in hominibus impiis

</p>
<p>in tanta re gratiam, aut inimicitias exercere ; eos mores,

<p>earn modestiam viri cognovi. Verum sententia non mihi
</p>
<p>crudelis, quid enim in talis homines crudele fieri potest 1
</p>
<p>sed aliena a republica nostra videtur. Nam profecto aut
</p>
<p>metus, aut 2 injuria te subegit, Silane, consulem designa-

<p>tum, genus poenae novum decernere. De timore super-
</p>
<p>vacaneum est disserere, cum, 3 praesenti diligentia claris-

<p>sumi viri, consulis, *tanta praesidia sint in armis. De
</p>
<p>poena possumus equidem dicere id, quod res habet ; in

<p>luctu atque miseriis mortem aerumnarum requiem, non
</p>
<p>cruciatum esse ; earn cuncta mortalium mala dissolvere ;
</p>
<p>5 ultra neque curae neque gaudio locum esse. Sed, per
</p>
<p>deos immortalis ! quamobrem in sententiam non addidisti,
</p>
<p>uti prius verberibus in eos animadverteretur ? an, quia
</p>
<p>6 lex Porcia vetat ? at aliae leges item condemnatis civi-
</p>
<p>bus animam non eripi, sed in exilium permitti jubent.
</p>
<p>An, quia gravius est verberari, quam necari ? quid autem

</p>
<p>2 Damasippum et alios hujusmodi, qui malo reipublicae

</p>
<p>homines scelestos, factiosos, qui seditionibus rempublicam
</p>
<p>exagitaverant, merito necatos aiebant. Sed ea res
</p>
<p>magnae initium cladis fait. Nam, uti quisque domum,
</p>
<p>aut villam, postremo aut vas, aut vestimentum alicujus
</p>
<p>concupiverat, dabat operam, uti in proscriptorum numero
</p>
<p>esset. Ita, quibus Damasippi mors laetitiae fuerat, post
</p>
<p>paullo ipsi trahebantur : neque prius finis jugulandi fuit,
</p>
<p>quam Sulla omnis suos divitiis explevit. 3 Atque ego
</p>
<p>haec non in M. Tullio, neque his temporibus, vereor :
</p>
<p>sed in magna civitate multa et varia ingenia sunt. Potest,
</p>
<p>alio tempore, alio consule, cui item exercitus in manus,
</p>
<p>falsum aliquid pro vero credi : ubi hoc exemplo, per
</p>
<p>senati decretum, consul gladium eduxerit, quis finem
</p>
<p>statuet, aut quis moderabitur ? Majores nostri, Patres
</p>
<p>conscripti, neque consilii, neque audaciae umquam eguere :
</p>
<p>neque superbia obstabat, quo minus aliena instituta, si
</p>
<p>modo proba, imitarentur. Arma atque tela militaria ab
</p>
<p>Samnitibus, 4 insignia magistratuum ab Tuscis pleraque
</p>
<p>sumserunt : postremo, quod ubique apud socios aut hostis
</p>
<p>idoneum videbatur, cum summo studio domi exsequeban-
</p>
<p>tur : 5 imitari, quam invidere bonis malebant. Sed, eodem

<p>illo tempore, Graeciae morem imitati, verberibus 6 animad-

</p>

</p>
<p>Nam 10 cetera turn u persequare, ubi facta sunt ; hoc, nisi

<p>LIII. Postquam Cato adsedit, consulares omnes, item-
</p>
<p>que senatus magna pars, sententiam ejus laudant, 2 virtu-
</p>
<p>tem animi ad coelum ferunt ; alii alios increpantes timidos
</p>

</p>
<p>Sciebam, saepenumero parva manu cum magnis legioni-
</p>
<p>bus hostium contendisse : cognoveram, parvis copiis bella
</p>
<p>gesta cum opulentis regibus ; ad hoc, saepe fortunae vio-
</p>
<p>lentiam toleravisse ; facundia Graecos, gloria belli Gallos
</p>
<p>ante Romanos fuisse. Ac mihi multa 6 agitanti constabat,
</p>
<p>paucorum civium egregiam virtutem cuncta patravisse j
</p>
<p>eoque factum, uti divitias paupertas, multitudinem pauci-
</p>
<p>tas super aret. Sed postquam luxu atque desidia ci vitas
</p>
<p>corrupta est, rursus respublica magnitudine sua impera-
</p>
<p>torum atque magistratuum vitia sustentabat ; ac, 7 veluti
</p>
<p>effoeta parente, multis tempestatibus haud sane quisquam

<p>Romae virtute magnus fuit. Sed, memoria mea, ingenti

</p>
<p>duxerat laborare, vigilare ; negotiis amicorum intentus, sua
</p>
<p>neglegere ; nihil denegare, quod dono dignum esset ; sibi
</p>
<p>magnum imperium, exercitum, novum bellum exoptabat,
</p>
<p>ubi virtus enitescere posset. 3 At Catoni studium modes-
</p>
<p>tiae, decoris, sed maxume severitatis erat. Non divitiis
</p>
<p>cum divite, neque 4 factione cum factioso ; sed cum stre-
</p>
<p>nuo virtute, cum modesto pudore, cum innocente 5 absti-
</p>
<p>nentia certabat : 6 esse, quam videri, bonus malebat : ita,
</p>
<p>^10 minus gloriam petebat, eo magis sequebatur
</p>
<p>LV. Postquam, ut dixi, senatus in Catonis sententiam
</p>
<p>aiscessit, consul optumum factum ratus, noctem, quae
</p>
<p>instabat, antecapere, ne quid eo spatio novaretur, 7 trium-
</p>
<p>viros, quae supplicium postulabat, parare jubet : ipse,
</p>
<p>dispositis praesidiis, Lentulum in carcerem deducit : idem
</p>
<p>fit ceteris per praetores. Est 8 locus in carcere, quod
</p>
<p>9 Tullianum adpellatur, ubi paullulum 10 escenderis ad lae-
</p>
<p>vam, circiter duodecim pedes humi depressus. Eum

<p>muniunt undique parietes, atque insuper n camera, lapideis

<p>fornicibus vincta : sed 12 incultu, tenebris, odore, foeda
</p>

<p>alii ^raeacutas sudes portabant. Sed, postquam Antonius
</p>
<p>cum exercitu adventabat, Catilina per montes iter facere
</p>
<p>ad urbem modo, modo 2 in Galliam versus, castra movere ,
</p>
<p>hostibus occasionem pugnandf non dare ; sperabat prope
</p>
<p>diem 3 sese habiturum, si Romae socii incepta patravis-
</p>
<p>sent. Interea servitia repudiabat, 4 cujus initio ad eum
</p>
<p>magnae copiae concurrebant, opibus conjurationis fretus ;
</p>
<p>simul 5 alienum suis rationibus existumans videri caussam
</p>
<p>civium cum servis fugitivis communicavisse.
</p>

</p>
<p>mae conjurationem patefactam, de Lentulo, Cethego, cet-
</p>
<p>eris, quos supra memoravi, supplicium sumtum ; plerique,
</p>
<p>quos ad bellum spes rapinarum, aut novarum rerum
</p>
<p>studium illexerat, dilabuntur ; reliquos Catilina per montis
</p>
<p>asperos, magnis itineribus, 6 in agrum Pistoriensem abdu-
</p>
<p>cit, eo consilio, uti per tramites occulte perfugerent in
</p>
<p>7 Galliam. At Q. Metellus Celer cum tribus legionibus
</p>
<p>in agro Piceno praesidebat, 8 ex difficultate rerum eadem
</p>
<p>ilia existumans, quae supra diximus, Catilinam agitare.
</p>
<p>Igitur, ubi iter ejus ex perfugis cognovit, castra propere
</p>
<p>movet, ac 9 sub ipsis radicibus montium consedit, qua illi
</p>
<p>descensus erat in Galliam properanti. Neque tamen
</p>
<p>Antonius procul aberat ; 10 utpote qui magno exercitu /
</p>
<p>locis aequioribus 11 expeditus, in fuga sequeretur. Sed
</p>
<p>Catilina, postquam videt 12 montibus atque copiis hostium
</p>
<p>sese clausum, in urbe res adversas, neque fugae, neque
</p>
<p>13 praesidii ullam spem ; optumum factum ratus in tali re
</p>
<p>fortunam belli tentare, statuit cum Antonio quamprimum

<p>confligere. Itaque, concione advocata, hujuscemodi ora-
</p>
<p>tionem habuit.

<p>^caussam consilii aperirem. Scitis equidem, milites,
</p>
<p>secordia atque ignavia Lentuli 2 quantam ipsi cladem no-
</p>
<p>bisque attulerit ; quoque modo, dum ex urbe praesidia
</p>
<p>opperior, in Galliam proficisci nequiverim. Nunc quo in
</p>
<p>loco res nostrae sint, juxta mecum omnes intellegitis.
</p>
<p>Exercitus hostium duo, 3 unus ab urbe, alter a Gallia,
</p>
<p>obstant : diutius in his locis esse, 4 si maxume animus
</p>
<p>ferat, frumenti atque aliarum rerum egestas prohibet.
</p>
<p>Quocurnque ire placet, ferro iter aperiundum est. Qua-
</p>
<p>propter vos moneo, uti forti atque parato animo sitis ; et,
</p>
<p>cum praelium inibitis, memineritis, vos divitias, decus,
</p>
<p>gloriam, praeterea libertatem atque patriam in dextris
</p>
<p>portare. Si vincimus, omnia nobis tuta, commeatus
</p>
<p>abunde, coloniae atque municipia patebunt : sin metu ces-
</p>
<p>serimus, eadem ilia advorsa fiunt : neque locus, neque
</p>
<p>amicus quisquam teget, quern arma non texerint. Prae-
</p>
<p>terea, milites, non eadem nobis et illis necessitudo im-
</p>
<p>pendet : nos pro patria, pro libertate, pro vita certamus ;
</p>
<p>5 illis supervacaneum est pugnare pro potentia paucorum.
</p>
<p>Quo audacius adgredimini, memores pristinae virtutis.
</p>
<p>Licuit nobis, cum summa turpitudine, in exilio aetatem
</p>
<p>agere : potuistis nonnulli Romae, amissis bonis, alienas
</p>
<p>opes exspectare. Quia ilia foeda atque intoleranda 6 viris
</p>
<p>videbantur, haec sequi decrevistis. Si 7 relinquere voltis
</p>
<p>audacia opus est : nemo, nisi victor, pace bellum mutavit.
</p>
<p>Nam in fuga salutem sperare, cum arma, 8 quis corpus
</p>
<p>tegitur, ab hostibus averteris, 9 ea vero dementia est.
</p>
<p>Semper in praelio maxumum est periculum, 10 qui maxume
</p>
<p>timent : audacia pro muro habetur. Cum vos considero,
</p>
<p>milites, et cum facta vestra aestumo, magna me spes
</p>
<p>victoriae tenet. Animus, aetas, virtus vestra hortantur ;
</p>
<p>praeterea necessitudo, quae etiam timidos fortis facit.

<p>LIX. Haec ubi dixit, paullulum commoratus, signi
</p>
<p>canere jubet, atque ^nstructos ordines in locum aequum
</p>
<p>deducit : dein, remotis omnium equis, quo militibus, ex-
</p>
<p>aequato periculo, animus amplior esset, ipse 2 pedes exer-
</p>
<p>citum, 3 pro loco atque copiis, instruit. 4 Nam, uti plani-
</p>
<p>ties erat inter sinistros montis, et, ab dextra, rupes aspera,
</p>
<p>octo cohortis in fronte constituit : 5 reliqua signa in
</p>
<p>subsidio artius collocat. 6 Ab his centuriones omnis lectos,
</p>
<p>et 7 evocatos, praeterea ex gregariis militibus optumum
</p>
<p>quemque armatum in primam aciem subducit. C. Man-
</p>
<p>lium in dextera, 8 Faesulanum quemdam sinistra parte
</p>
<p>curare jubet : ipse cum 9 libertis et colonis 10 propter aqui-
</p>
<p>lam adsistit, quam, bello n Cimbrico, C. Marius in exer-
</p>
<p>citu habuisse dicebatur. At ex altera parte C. Antonius,
</p>
<p>12 pedibus aeger, quod praelio adesse nequibat, M. Petreio
</p>
<p>legato exercitum permittit. Ille cohortis veteranas, quas
</p>
<p>13 tumulti caussa conscripserat, in fronte ; post eas, cete-
</p>
<p>rum exercitum in subsidiis locat. 14 Ipse equo circumiens,
</p>
<p>unumquemque nominans adpellat, hortatur, rogat, uti
</p>
<p>meminerint, se contra latrones 15 inermos, pro patria, pro
</p>
<p>libens, pro aris atque focis suis, 16 cernere. Homo milita-
</p>
<p>ris, quod amplius annos triginta 17 tribunus, aut 18 prae-

<p>plerosque ipsos factaque eorum fortia noverat : v ea com-

<p>signum dat, cohortis paullatim incedere jubet ; idem facit

<p>Postquam fusas copias, seque cum paucis relictum videt

<p>LXI. Sed, confecto praelio, turn vero cerneres, quan-

<p>ta audacia, quantaque animi vis fuisset in exercitu Cati-

</p>
<p>cohors p-raetoria disjecerat, 3 paullo diversius, sed omnes
</p>
<p>tamen adversis volneribus conciderant. Catilina vero
</p>
<p>longe a suis inter hostium cadavera repertus est, paullu-

<p>vivus, in voltu retinens. Postremo, ex omni copia, neque

<p>NOTES
</p>
<p>TO THE
</p>
<p>JUGURTHINE WAR.
</p>
<p>Pfte
</p>
<p>'. Falso queritur, &c. "Mankind complain without reason
</p>
<p>f r^ir nature." Falso, literally, " falsely," " erroneously." 
</p>
<p>Sallust has been justly blamed for the introductions to his histories.
</p>
<p>They have little if any relation to the subject which they are in
</p>
<p>tended to usher in, and are too discursive and long.
</p>
<p>2. Quod imbecilla, &c. " That, being weak and of short duration
</p>
<p>it is influenced more by chance, than by the exertion of intellect."
</p>
<p>Imbecilla agrees with natura. The less usual form of this adjective
</p>
<p>is imbecillis.  Virtute is here equivalent to virtute animi.
</p>
<p>3. Nam contra. " For, on the contrary."
</p>
<p>4. Invenias. " You will find, I think."  The subjunctive is here
</p>
<p>employed to convey a softened assertion, indicative of modesty on
</p>
<p>the part of the writer, and not of any doubt in his mind on the sub-
</p>
<p>ject which he is discussing. So crediderim is frequently used, in
</p>
<p>the sense of " I am inclined to believe."
</p>
<p>5. Magisque naturae, &c. " And that active exertion is more
</p>
<p>wanting to the nature of men, than ability or duration," i. e. than
</p>
<p>additional power or an enlarged period of existence.  Naturae
</p>
<p>hominum is equivalent to Jiomini, " And that man stands more in
</p>
<p>need of," &c.
</p>
<p>6. Sed dux atque imperator, &c. A refutation of those who
</p>
<p>maintain, that human nature is influenced more by chance than by
</p>
<p>any exertion of the mental powers. Sed may be rendered " Now."
</p>
<p> Dux atque imperator. "The director and ruler." Imperator
</p>
<p>rises in force of meaning above dux. The former means literally,
</p>
<p>"commander in chief;" whereas dux means the highest of the in-
</p>
<p>ferior officers, having himself an important command. These are
</p>
<p>here applied to one and the same objects, for the purpose of showing
</p>
<p>the all-controlling power of *he mind.
</p>
<p>7. Grassatur, " Aspires." Literally, "moves boldly on."
</p>
<p>8. Pollens potensque. " P3werful and vigorous." Pollens refer?

<p>122 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page
</p>
<p>9 Quippe probttatem, &c. " Since it (i. e. fortune) can neithei
</p>
<p>give, nor take away, integrity, activity, nor other praiseworthy quali
</p>
<p>ties." Industria here means an active exercise of our abilities.  
</p>
<p>The student will notice the use of artis for artes Sallust is very
</p>
<p>much attached to this form of the accusative, omnis for omnes, po-
</p>
<p>pularis for popular es, &c. It is called an archaism, (a term gene-
</p>
<p>rally applied to the use of antiquated or obsolete forms of expression,)
</p>
<p>though not very correctly, since the termination in is would seem
</p>
<p>to have been most commonly employed in the best ages of Latinity.
</p>
<p>The common grammatical rule is, that nouns, whose genitive plural
</p>
<p>ends in ium, have es, is, or eis, in the accusative plural.
</p>
<p>10. Ad inertiam et voluptatis corporis, &c. " It has been con-
</p>
<p>signed to the destructive bondage of sloth and corporeal gratifica-
</p>
<p>tions." The literal meaning of pes sum appears to be " down," " to
</p>
<p>the bottom," "under foot." Hence pessumdo literally means,
</p>
<p>"to send or throw to the bottom," and then figuratively, "to
</p>
<p>ruin or destroy."  Voluptatis is put for voluptates. See previous
</p>
<p>note.
</p>
<p>11. Perniciosa luhdine, &c. In rendering, begin with ubi, "when,
</p>
<p>after it has enjoyed for a season this destructive indulgence," &c.
</p>
<p>12. Suam quisque culpam, &c. " The authors of these evils
</p>
<p>transfer each to affairs the blame that is their own." They allege
</p>
<p>in extenuation of their mental inactivity, that the affairs to which they
</p>
<p>had directed their attention proved too difficult of accomplishment.
</p>
<p>13. Quod si hominibus, &c. "But if mankind were inspired
</p>
<p>with as great a regard for things conducive to their welfare, as is
</p>
<p>-he zeal with which they seek after," &c.  Aliena, " things foreign
</p>
<p>to their nature."
</p>
<p>14. Neque regerentur, &c. " They would not be more controlled
</p>
<p>by, than they would themselves control, the chances of fortune."
</p>
<p>15. Ubi, pro mortalibus. " In which, as far as is consistent with
</p>
<p>mortal lot." Pro mortalibus, literally, " for mortals." Equivalent
</p>
<p>to quatenus mortalibus fas est.

<p>16. Genus humanum. " Man."
</p>
<p>17. Sequuntur. " Partake of."
</p>
<p>18. Praeclara fades. "Personal beauty."  Literally ' a fine
</p>
<p>face," or " exterior."
</p>
<p>19. Milabuntur. " Insensibly leave us,"  Literally, " steal away,"
</p>
<p>"dropoff."
</p>
<p>20. Ingenii egregia factnora. " fhe splendid exertions of intel-
</p>
<p>lect."  Facinus denotes a bold or daring action, and unless it be
</p>
<p>T oined with a favourable epithet, or the action be previously cte-
</p>
<p>icribed as commendable, the term is a] vvays to be understood in a
</p>
<p>JUGURTHINE WAR. 123
</p>
<p>Page,
</p>
<p>ntupera' tve sense. In the present passage, the epithet egregius 1
</p>
<p>marks the character of the action as praiseworthy.
</p>
<p>21. Corporis etfortunae bonorum. " Of the advantages of person
</p>
<p>and fortune."
</p>
<p>1. Agit atque habet cuncta, &c. " Controls and sways all 2
</p>
<p>things, and is itself controlled by none." After habetur understand
</p>
<p>ab ullo (scil. negotio.)
</p>
<p>2. Quo magis pravitas, &c. " On which account the depravity
</p>
<p>of those is the more to be wondered at," &c.
</p>
<p>3. Incultu. " Through want of culture."
</p>
<p>4. Artes animi. " Mental employments."
</p>
<p>5. Ex his. " Of these employments of mind." Understand
</p>
<p>artibus animi.
</p>
<p>6. Omnis cura, &c. " All change of public affairs," or " every
</p>
<p>office of administration." Of these offices, magistrates are of a
</p>
<p>civil, imperia of a military nature.
</p>
<p>7. Quoniam neque virtuti, &c. " Since, neither, on the one
</p>
<p>hand, is the honour, that is its due, rendered to merit, nor are they,
</p>
<p>on the other, who have obtained authority by unfair means," &c. 
</p>
<p>The allusion in fraudem is to bribery and other unworthy and de-
</p>
<p>grading practices.
</p>
<p>8. Parentes. " Subjected states." From pareo, " to obey,"
</p>
<p>and having the first syllable long. In parentes, "parents," it is
</p>
<p>short.  The word occurs again in the first chapter of this history.
</p>
<p>9. Delicta corrigas, " may rectify abuses."  Importunum, " a
</p>
<p>perilous task." Literally, " without a harbour," or place of safety
</p>
<p>from the storm.
</p>
<p>10. Fatigando. " After all one's exertions." Understand se s
</p>
<p>which in some editions is expressed.
</p>
<p>11. Quern. For aliquem.  Lubido, an archaism for libido.
</p>
<p>12. Gratifcari. " Of sacrificing." i. e. Tanquam rem gratam
</p>
<p>devovere.  More usual Latinity would require gratificandi ; but Sal
</p>
<p>lust is fond of unusual forms of expression.

</p>
<p>own profession," i. e. of an historian. Before extollere understand mi.

<p>2 17. Certe, &c, Supply the ellipsis as follows: " Ii certe hot,
</p>
<p>facient, quibus," &c.
</p>
<p>18. Salutare plebem. " To court the favour of the populace.'
</p>
<p>Referring to the acts of candidates in electioneering for office, going
</p>
<p>around, addressing in a friendly manner, shaking hands with voters,
</p>
<p>&c.
</p>
<p>19. Quibus temporibus. Sallust obtained the office of quaestor,
</p>
<p>which entitled him to a seat in the senate, at the age of twenty-
</p>
<p>seven, a few years after the conspiracy of Catiline, and while the
</p>
<p>state was thrown into the greatest confusion by the acts of Clodius
</p>
<p>and his followers. He was made tribune of the commons six year3
</p>
<p>after, on which occasion, according to some authorities, Cato was
</p>
<p>his competitor, but, according to others, when he was made praetor.
</p>
<p>To his success over Cato the historian alludes in the words quotes
</p>
<p>viri, &c. If this competition occurred for the office of praetor, he
</p>
<p>had no great reason to be proud of his success, since he obtained
</p>
<p>that magistracy entirely through the interest of Caesar.
</p>
<p>20. Merito. " On good grounds."  Judicium animi mutavisse.
</p>
<p>"Have altered my determination."  Aliorum negotiis. "The
</p>
<p>active employment of others."
</p>
<p>21. Q. Maximum. Quintus Fabius Maxrmus, the well-known op-
</p>
<p>ponent of Hannibal.  P. Scipionem. The elder Africanus, who con-
</p>
<p>quered Hannibal in the battle of Zama.  Solitos. Understand esse.
</p>
<p>q 1. Imagines. Among the Romans, those whose ancestors, or
</p>
<p>** who themselves had borne any curule office, that is, had been consul,
</p>
<p>praetor, censor, or curule aedile, were called nobiles, and had the
</p>
<p>right of making images of themselves, which were kept with great
</p>
<p>care by their posterity, and exhibited only at funerals or on solemn
</p>
<p>occasions. These images were nothing more than the busts or
</p>
<p>effigies of the individuals, down to the shoulders, made of wax, and
</p>
<p>painted. They were placed in the atrium, or hall, of the Roman
</p>
<p>house, enclosed in wooden cases.
</p>
<p>2. Scilicet non ceram illam, &c. We must here resolve scilicet

</p>
<p>into its component members (scire licet,) and construe as follows .
</p>
<p>Scire licet non ceram illam, &c. habere. " We may well suppose
</p>
<p>that neither the mere wax of which they were made, nor the form
</p>
<p>it had assumed, possessed such power in themselves."
</p>
<p>3. Eorum. " Of the former." Referring to their ancestors, and
</p>
<p>depending in construction on famam and gloriam. With virtus
</p>
<p>supply sua ipsorum, " their own merit." Sallust here argues in fa-
</p>
<p>vour of history, as a means of exciting to noble and praiseworthy
</p>
<p>actions, by its recounting the deeds of former days.
</p>
<p>4. His moribus. " Amid the corruption of the day." i. e Amid
</p>
<p>JUGURTHINE WAR. 12?
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>hese manners that are now prevalent.  Quin contendat, " who does Q
</p>
<p>not seek to vie." Quin is here equivalent to qui non.
</p>
<p>5. Homines novi. "Men of humble origin." Literally, "new
</p>
<p>men." Those who were the first of their family that had raised
</p>
<p>themselves to any curule office, were called among the Romans,
</p>
<p>homines novi, in allusion to their recent admission among the no-
</p>
<p>bility.
</p>
<p>6. Furtim et per latrocinia. " By private intrigue and open
</p>
<p>fraud." The acts of peculation, and official plunder, of which the
</p>
<p>Roman magistrates were so frequently guilty, are here stigmatized,
</p>
<p>and they are spoken of as actually affording the means for farther ad-
</p>
<p>vancement in the state. Sallust himself is open to this charge.  Af-
</p>
<p>ter potius we have rejected from the text, with some of the best edi-
</p>
<p>tions, the words quam bonis artibus, as the idea is sufficiently ex
</p>
<p>pressed by per virtutem which precedes.
</p>
<p>7. Ac non perinde habeantur. " And are not to be estima-
</p>
<p>ted according to the merit of those who fill them." Ac is more fre-
</p>
<p>quently employed after perinde than ut. But its occurrence at the
</p>
<p>beginning of the clause prevents its being again employed on the
</p>
<p>principle of euphony.
</p>
<p>8. Liberius altiusque. " Too freely and too far." Com
</p>
<p>pare remarks under note 1, page 1.  Redeo. Put here for eo,
</p>
<p>i. e. venio, the compound for the simple. " I now come to my subject."
</p>

</p>
<p>midia answers in some measure to the modern Algiers. Consult
</p>
<p>Geographical Index.
</p>
<p>10. Atrox. "Bloody."  Variaque victoria f wit. "And the sue
</p>
<p>cess was various," i. e. and marked by various turns of fortune ;
</p>
<p>victory mclining sometimes to the side of the Romans, and then
</p>
<p>again to that of Jugurtha.
</p>
<p>11. Obviam itum est. " Successful opposition was made."  Di-
</p>
<p>vina et humana cuncta. " All things religious and civil," i. e. the
</p>
<p>whole state.  Studiis civilibus, " to the dissensions of the state,"

<p>or simply, " civil dissensions." With faceret understand solum or
</p>
<p>tantum, " only."
</p>
<p>12. Pauca supra repetam. " I will take a brief review."
</p>
<p>13. Quo, ad cognoscendum, &c. "In order that all things may
</p>
<p>be clearer, and placed in a more distinct point of view, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of being thoroughly understood." Ad cognoscendum, literally,
</p>
<p>"for the knowing of them." The gerund, according to the gram-
</p>
<p>marians, is here taken in a passive sense. The change of meaning,
</p>
<p>nowever, is rather owing to the idiom of modern languages, as ap-
</p>
<p>pears from the literal force of ad cognoscendum.

<p>J 14. Bello Punico secundo. Consult Historical Index, for an ac-
</p>
<p>count of the Punic wars, and also for some mention of the Cartha-
</p>
<p>ginians, Hannibal, and Masinissa, under their respective heads. 
</p>
<p>Post magnitudinem nominis Romani. " Since the Roman name
</p>
<p>became illustrious. "
</p>
<p>15. Cui postea Africano, &c. The term Africano is here put in
</p>
<p>the dative by attraction to the dative of the person. In rendering
</p>
<p>the clause, Africano must be taken as equivalent to Africani or Af-
</p>
<p>ricanus. Thus, Est mihi nomen Joanni, " my name is John ;" for
</p>
<p>Est mihi nomen Joannis, (or Joannes.)
</p>
<p>16. Praeclara rei militaris facinora. " Brilliant military exploits."
</p>
<p>Consult note 4, page 2.  Syphace. Consult Historical Index
</p>
<p>The proper name Syphax is said to have the penult of the genitive
</p>
<p>common. It is on the contrary always long, for the line in Clau-
</p>
<p>dian (Bell. Gild. 91.) where the short quantity occurs, " Compuli-
</p>
<p>mus dirum Syphacem, fractumque Metello," is now altered in the
</p>
<p>best editions, after a conjecture of Barth's, and we read Hanibalem
</p>
<p>for Syphacem.
</p>
<p>17. Regi. Referring to Masinissa.
</p>
<p>18. Imperii vitaeque ejus, &c. The grant of the Romans ceased
</p>
<p>with the life of Masinissa. His son Micipsa reigned merely over
</p>
<p>that part of Numidia which had originally belonged to his parent.
</p>
<p>Cirta, and the portion of Numidia which Syphax had possessed, were
</p>
<p>formed into a Roman province. Hence imperii in the text refers to
</p>
<p>the empire of Masinissa in its full extent, embracing what he had
</p>
<p>received from the Romans.
</p>
<p>4 1. Absumtis. " Being carried off."
</p>
<p>2. Eodem cultu, &c. " He reared at home in the same way as
</p>
<p>he did his own children." Cultus here has reference to every thing
</p>
<p>connected with the rearing of youth. It may be rendered more
</p>
<p>literally by the term "education." Thus, "he kept at his court,
</p>
<p>and trained up by the same system of education," &c.
</p>
<p>3. Luxu. The old dative for luxui.  Corrumpendum. "To be

</p>
<p>them." Understand illis in the ablative, and consult note 13,
</p>
<p>page 3.
</p>
<p>4. Equitare, jaculari, &c. " He engaged in feats of horseman-
</p>
<p>ship, he learned to throw the lance," &c. The infinitive is here
</p>
<p>put for the imperfect of the indicative, a practice of which Sallust is
</p>
<p>perhaps fonder than any other writer. Grammarians term it the
</p>
<p>historical infinitive, as being principally used in historical narratives,
</p>
<p>in order to give an air of rapidity and animation to the sentence.
</p>
<p>This construction is usually explained by an ellipsis of coepit or coa-

<p>will not accord with the sense.

</p>
<p>all in reputation." Omnis is put for omnes. Consult note 9, page

</p>
<p>sentence, agere for agebat, ferire for feriebat, facer e for faciebat, and
</p>
<p>loqui for loquebatur.
</p>
<p>6. Hominem adolescentem. " The young man." Sallust, by a
</p>
<p>species of archaism (note 9, p. 1.) here uses adolescens, with homo
</p>
<p>expressed, as a verbal adjective. Adolescens is, strictly speaking,
</p>
<p>a verbal, and means " one growing up."  Ezactasua aetate. " His
</p>
<p>own age being far advanced."
</p>
<p>7. Magis magisque crescere. " Increased more and more in
</p>
<p>reputation." Crescere is here the ordinary infinitive, preceded in
</p>
<p>construction by hominem adolescentem.
</p>
<p>8. Avida imperii, &c. " Eager after power, and hurried head-
</p>
<p>long to the gratification of its ruling propensity." Animi cupidinem
</p>
<p>is an archaism for cupidinem alone.  Opportunitas suaeque, &c.
</p>
<p>" The favourable opportunity afforded by his own and the age of his
</p>
<p>children, a circumstance which leads even moderate men astray by
</p>

<p>5. Non mediocrem animum. " The ambitious spirit."
</p>
<p>6. Romae omnia venalia esse. Meaning that he could purchase, if
</p>
<p>he pleased, the kingdom of Numidia from the Romans, after the
</p>
<p>death of Micipsa. The power of Jugurtha's bribes will be seen in
</p>
<p>the course of the narrative.
</p>
<p>7. Revorti. An archaism for reverti.  Praetorium. " The gene-
</p>
<p>ral's tent.," i. e. his own (Scipio's) tent. The name of praetor was
</p>
<p>anciently common to all the Roman magistrates, and, in its primi-
</p>
<p>tive acceptation, means a commander, or general. (Is qui praeit
</p>
<p>jure et exercitu. Varro.) The term praetorium is often used to de-
</p>
<p>note not only the tent of the commander, but also the space around
</p>
<p>for his retinue and body-guard ; not, however, in this passage.
</p>
<p>8. Publice, quam privatim. " Publicly rather than privately,"
</p>
<p>i. e. by public services, rather than by private interest.  Quibus
</p>
<p>for aliquibus.  Periculose a paucis emi, &c. Implying that the
</p>
<p>kingdom of Numidia belonged to the whole Roman people, and not
</p>
<p>to a few of the nobility. That if he sought to obtain it from the latter
</p>
<p>by bribery, he would only be exposing himself to danger.
</p>
<p>9. In suis artibus. " In the exercise of those abilities which he
</p>
<p>possessed."  Vitro. " Of their own accord," i. e. without any ex-
</p>
<p>ertion on his part.  Properantius . "Too eagerly," i. e. should
</p>
<p>attempt to expedite his elevation to the throne by bribery.
</p>
<p>10. Pro nostra amicitia. " As a friend." Literally, u in considera-
</p>
<p>tion of our mutual friendship."
</p>
<p>11. Igitur rex, &c. " The king, therefore, when he learned from
</p>
<p>the general's letter, that the things which he had heard from rumour
</p>
<p>were true." Ita esse, equivalent to ita esse uti acceperat. " Were
</p>
<p>so as he had heard."  Cum virtuteviri, &c. " Strongly influenced
</p>
<p>both by the merit of the man, and his popularity with the Romans."
</p>
<p>S 1. Cum Jugurtha. The presence of the preposition marks the
</p>
<p>'^miliar nature of the address to Jugurtha, which approached in fact

<p>io a conversation.
</p>
<p>2. In meum regnum. " Into my kingdom," i. e. as one of m}
</p>
<p>heirs. In this assertion of Micipsa there was evidently no truth,
</p>
<p>and Jugurtha himself, as appears from the beginning of the next
</p>
<p>chapter, viewed it in this light.  Existumans non minus, &c.
</p>
<p>" Thinking that I would be no less dear to you, than to my own
</p>
<p>children, in case I should become the father of any." According to
</p>
<p>this declaration of Micipsa, he adopted Jugurtha before he had any
</p>
<p>offspring of his own The want of truth in this assertion speaks foi
</p>
<p>itself.

<p>3. Neque eares falsum habuit. Understand me. "Nor did that 6
</p>
<p>expectation deceive me." Falsum habuit is equivalent to fefellit.

<p>Tua. Understand facta, in the sense of-" exploits."

<p>4. Gloria honor axis ti. " Thou hast decked with glory."  No-

<p>of Massinissa.

</p>
<p>luding to his adoption, and the obligation he was consequently un

<p>kindness towards you." Alluding to his having adopted him. 
</p>
<p>Alienos. " Strangers."

</p>
<p>8. Ne aliter quid eveniat. " That nothing may happen contrary
</p>
<p>to my wishes," i. e. literally, " otherwise than I could wish."  Opu-

<p>lentior. " The more powerful." This term literally means, " pow-
</p>
<p>erful in resources," pollens opibus.  Oolite, observate. " Cherish,
</p>
<p>respect."  Hunc. The pronoun indicates the proximity of Jugurtha
</p>
<p>to the couch of the dying monarch.  Sumsisse. " To have adopt*
</p>
<p>ed." The more usual, but less accurate, form, is sumpsisse.
</p>
<p>9. Ficta. "Insincerely." Literally, "mere fictions."  Pro tern
</p>
<p>pore, &c. " Gave an affectionate answer, suited to the occasion."
</p>
<p>Pro tempore, literally, in consideration of the occasion.

<p>properly " a petty monarch."  Minumus. " The youngest." Un

<p>derstand natu.
</p>
<p>2. Ferox. "Violent."  IgnobilitatemJugurthae. "The ignoble

<p>oirth of Jugurtha." Quia materno genere impar erat. " Because his
</p>
<p>origin was base on the mother's side." Literally, "because he was
</p>
<p>unequal, or inferior," &c. The allusion is to Jugurtha's having
</p>
<p>been born of a concubine.

</p>
<p>Adherbal." The accusative Adherbalem is governed by ad in com-

</p>
<p>In partem alteram. M To the opposite side."

<p>Jacit. " Throws out the remark," i. e. proposes.  Rescindi. " Should

<p>Maturius. "First." Literally, "sooner."  Loca propinqua the-

<p>sauris. It seems to have been the custom with the monarchs of
</p>
<p>that land to keep the royal treasures in several strongholds. Thus,
</p>
<p>in the 37th chapter of this history, the town Suthul is mentioned, as
</p>
<p>having been employed for that purpose ; in the 75th chapter, Thala ;
</p>
<p>in the 92d chapter, a castle is spoken of ; and Strabo finally calls
</p>
<p>Capsa, to ya$o<pv\a.Kiov tov 'lovyovpda.

<p>7. Proxumus lictor. " Chief lictor." i. e. chief attendant. The
</p>
<p>lictors went before those whom they attended, one by one, in a
</p>
<p>regular line. The foremost was called lictor primus, and the hind-
</p>
<p>most, who immediately preceded the magistrate, was called lictor
</p>
<p>proximus, or postremus, and used to receive and execute the com-
</p>
<p>mands of the individual on whom he attended. Masinissa had been
</p>
<p>allowed by the Roman senate to assume the badges of curule ma-
</p>
<p>gistracy, in consideration of his valuable services. In this way,
</p>
<p>lictors became a part of the retinue of the Numidian monarchs.
</p>
<p>Some, however, suppose that Sallust merely uses the term lictor on
</p>
<p>nis occasion in accordance with the custom of other Roman writers,

<p>num is here employed to denote a mean or pooi apartment, such *7
</p>
<p>as slaves were lodged in. With regard to the expression mulieris
</p>
<p>ancillae, it may be remarked, that ancilla, strictly speaking, is an
</p>
<p>adjective, and is so used by the older writers, whom Sallust here
</p>
<p>imitates : not, however, by those of a later age.
</p>
<p>1. Omnisque. F 'or omnesque.  In duas partis discedunt. "They fc
</p>
<p>separate into two parties." Partis for partes.  Blum alterum.
</p>
<p>" The other," i. e. Jugurtha. The pronoun Me here represents, by
</p>
<p>a species of archaism, the definite article, which the Latin language
</p>
<p>wants.
</p>
<p>2. Partim vi, &c. " Some by force, others of their own ccsisent."
</p>
<p>Partim, here used in the sense of alias, and elsewhere in Sallust jt
</p>
<p>an adverb, is in fact the old accusative of pars, for the later form
</p>
<p>partem, and governed by quod ad, or secundum, understood.
</p>
<p>3. Tamen etsi. An archaism for tametsi.
</p>
<p>4. In provinciam. "Into the Roman province." i. e. the terri-
</p>
<p>tory of Carthage, which the Romans, after the death of Massinissa.,
</p>
<p>on whom they had bestowed it for the period of his life, formed into
</p>
<p>a province.
</p>
<p>5. Jugurtha, patratis consiliis. After this in some editions we
</p>
<p>have postquam omni Numidiapotiebatur. This, however, is entirely
</p>
<p>superfluous, and is already implied in patratis consiliis.
</p>
<p>6. Quis. For quibus.  Uti expleant. "To satisfy fully." 
</p>
<p>Quemcumque possint, &c. "To gain over whomsoever they can by
</p>
<p>dint of bribery," Some editions read quaecunque, &c. "To ac-
</p>
<p>complish whatever they can," &c. The reading in the text, how
</p>
<p>ever, is more animated and forcible.
</p>
<p>7. Aliisque. "And to others," namely, of the nobility.  Auclo-
</p>
<p>ritas. " Influence" in the senate.  Invidia. " Odium."  In
</p>
<p>gratiam et favor em. " Into the good graces and favour."
</p>
<p>8. Singulos ex senatu ambiundo. " By going around to each

<p>9 however, is more forcible, and carries with it an air of greater cer*

<p>tainty.  Cum agitarem. " While I was zealously acting in ac-
</p>
<p>cordance with." The student will note the peculiar force of th
</p>
<p>frequentative.  Et jam ab stripe, &c. "And even by my very
</p>
<p>lineage the ally and friend," &c. i. e. the hereditary ally and friend.
</p>
<p>3. Atqwe ego, &c. The ^general idea, intended to be conveyed
</p>
<p>by this whole passage, is as follows : I could have wished, conscript
</p>
<p>fathers, since I was destined to be plunged into this misery, that
</p>
<p>I might have been able to implore your aid, rather on account of my
</p>
<p>own services, than those of my ancestors ; and above all, that I
</p>
<p>might have merited the gratitude of Rome, without needing her pro-
</p>
<p>tection ; or that, in case I did stand in need of it, I might have
</p>
<p>received it as my due. As, however, innocence is of itself but a
</p>
<p>weak defence, &c.
</p>
<p>4. Vellem. To be rendered as if voluissem.  Mea. " Services that
</p>
<p>I might have rendered."  Ob majorum beneficia. " On account of
</p>
<p>any rendered by my ancestors."  Ac maxume. " And above all." 
</p>
<p>Deberi mihi. " That favours might have been owing to me. " 
</p>
<p>Secundum ea. "Next to this," or, more freely, "in the next place."
</p>
<p>Equivalent to secundo loco quibus. Some editions read secundum
</p>
<p>With a comma after it, separating it from ea. Secundum will then
</p>
<p>mean " in the next place," and ea be joined in construction with
</p>
<p>desideranda essent.
</p>
<p>5. Neque mihi in manu fuit, &c. " Nor was it in my power to
</p>
<p>form the character of Jugurtha." Literally, " to effect what kind
</p>
<p>of person Jugurtha should be." After foret the verb efficere may
</p>
<p>be understood, although this is not necessary, since the clause,
</p>
<p>qualis foret Jugurtha, may be regarded as the subject nominative to
</p>
<p>fuit.
</p>
<p>6. Quo tempore, &c. This refers to the Romans, who were, at the
</p>
<p>time to which the prince alludes, engaged in an important and diffi-
</p>
<p>cult war with the Carthaginians, and might be faithful, but could

</p>
<p>not, when their resources were thus pre-occupied, prove very efficient
</p>
<p>allies. Ejus refers to populo Romano.
</p>
<p>7. Quorum progeniem. Supply me. Quorum refers to familia,
</p>
<p>a collective noun, and to the idea of majores implied in it.  Nihil
</p>
<p>eausae. " No other plea."  Deformatus aerumnis. " Forlorn and
</p>
<p>wretched."
</p>
<p>8. Tam,en erat. " Still it were." Erat is here used instead of
</p>
<p>esset, to denote more of certainty by means of th% indicative.  JSequs
</p>
<p>cujusquam, &c. " And that the kingdom of no one should increase
</p>
<p>in power, by the commission of crime." There is no need of un-
</p>
<p>derstanding, as some do, the verb pati after neque.
</p>

</p>
<p>9. Vos in mea injuria, &c. " You are treated with contempt in Q
</p>
<p>the injustice that is done me." Despicere always implies that the
</p>
<p>person despising thinks meanly of the person despised, as compared
</p>
<p>with himself. Contemnere denotes the absolute vileness of an
</p>
<p>object.
</p>
<p>10. Potissumum. " Of all others."
</p>
<p>11. Semperne in sanguine, &c. " Shall we always be exposed
</p>
<p>to the horrors of bloodshed, to the sword, to exile 1"  Incolumes
</p>
<p>M Powerful." Literally, " safe," i. e. from Roman power and do
</p>
<p>minion.  Jure. "As a matter of course." Equivalent to jure
</p>
<p>necessitatis.
</p>
<p>1. Ulapestis. " That plague." Referring to the Carthaginians. 10
</p>
<p> Pacem agitabamus. The frequentative is frequently employed
</p>
<p>by Sallust for the simple verb to give more fulness to the style.
</p>
<p>Agitabamus is here put for agebamus.  Quis for quibus.  Quern
</p>
<p>jussissetis. " Him, whom vou might have ordered us to regard as
</p>
<p>such."
</p>
<p>2. Sese ecferens. An archaism for sese efferens, and this equiva-
</p>
<p>lent to elatus, "hurried away."  Atque eodem. "And who was at
</p>
<p>the same time."
</p>
<p>3. Isdem. An archaism for iisdem.  Nihil minus, quam, &c. " Ex
</p>
<p>pecting nothing so little as violence or war, in a country subjected
</p>
<p>to your authority."
</p>
<p>4. Extorrem patria, &c. The student will note the imitation of
</p>
<p>the Greek idiom, in which Sallust here indulges. Effecit me extor-
</p>
<p>rem, &c., ut essem, instead of effecit uti ego nihil minus quam, &c.
</p>
<p>exspectans, sicuti videtis, extorris patria, domo, inops, coopertus
</p>
<p>miseriis, ubivis tutius quam in regno meo essem.
</p>
<p>5. Multum laborem suscipere. " Undertook an arduous task."
</p>
<p>The prince now enters on the following argument :  If my ancestors
</p>
<p>embraced the friendship and alliance of Rome, not from motives of
</p>
<p>indolence, nor from a wish to lead an easy and inactive life, but
</p>
<p>well knowing, on the contrary, how many arduous labours they

<p>would have to perform, and how much would be expected from
</p>
<p>them by the Roman state as a proof of their fidelity ; and if they
</p>
<p>rendered all these services, and gave all these proofs of their sincerity
</p>
<p>and attachment ; surely I, their descendant, have some right to
</p>
<p>expect both commiseration and aid at your hands.
</p>
<p>6. Quod in familia nostra fuit, &c. "What was in the power
</p>
<p>of our family to perform, it did ; that it might aid you, namely, in all
</p>
<p>your wars." Our idiom requires the past tense of the indicative ;
</p>
<p>" it aided you in all your wars."

<p>Referring to Jugurtha. Some editions have alter, referring of course
</p>
<p>to the speaker.
</p>
<p>8. Generis praesidia, &c. " All the supports of my family are
</p>
<p>cut off."  Naturae concessit. " Has paid the debt of nature."
</p>
<p>Literally, "has yielded to nature," i. e. to the universal law of
</p>
<p>nature.
</p>
<p>9. Quern minume decuit. " Whom such a deed least of all be-
</p>
<p>came," i. e. who should have been the last to do it. The clause
</p>
<p>refers to propinquus, not to fratri.
</p>
<p>10. Adftnes, amicos, &c. " One disaster has crushed crce,
</p>
<p>another has crushed another, of my relatives, my friends, the rest of
</p>
<p>those who were near to me." Sallust is very fond of the construction
</p>
<p>with alius. It must be repeated in translating.
</p>
<p>11. Pars .... acti. An instance of the figure which gram-
</p>
<p>marians call synesis, where the adjective, participle, &c. refer to
</p>
<p>the person or persons implied by a word, and do not agree in gendei
</p>
<p>with the word itself. Acti, in this clause, and objecti, in the next,
</p>
<p>refer to adfines, amid, and propinqui } and agree with them in
</p>
<p>gender.
</p>
<p>12. Exigunt. "Drag out."  Necessariis. "Friendly." Ne-
</p>
<p>cessaria are here opposed to adversa, and denote those acts of kind-
</p>
<p>ness and affection which we are necessarily led to expect from those
</p>
<p>who are connected with us by the ties of consanguinity. And hence
</p>
<p>the term necessitudo is used for relationship or any intimate con-
</p>
<p>nexion. Adherbal expected from Jugurtha the kindness and affec-
</p>
<p>tion of a brother, but only met with acts of hostility.
</p>
<p>13. Nunc vero, &c. This is an instance of what the logicians
</p>
<p>call the argument a fortiori. Even though I had not been stripped
</p>
<p>of my kingdom and all my resources, remarks Adherbal, still, if any
</p>
<p>unexpected injury had been done me, I would have implored your

<p>fathers," i. e. committed by them against the neighbouring nations

<p>in furtherance of the Roman power.

</p>
<p>any aid from other powers ; and even if I could, the injunctions of

</p>
<p>of quod before many conjunctions, &c, merely as a copulative, ap-

<p>connexion by means of relatives.

</p>
<p>1 1 The reason ol this appellation is more apparent, however, in Greek
</p>
<p>from its taking the prepositive article before it in all cases ; as rd
</p>
<p>ypa<peiv, rov yp&Qeiv, tc5 yp&Qetv. The same construction is not un-
</p>
<p>known in English. Thus Spenser : 
</p>
<p>"For not to have been dipped in Lethe lake,
</p>
<p>Could save the son of Thetis from to die."
</p>
<p>11. Ncu jure contemtus, &c. " And that I might not appear a
</p>
<p>just object of contempt." Cortius reads vivere instead of jure, and
</p>
<p>makes it equivalent to viverem, regarding viderer as a mere appen-
</p>
<p>dage to the sentence, in imitation of the Greek idiom, where words
</p>
<p>that refer literally to what appears to be the case, are sometimes
</p>
<p>taken in the sense of reality, and refer to what is actually the case ;
</p>
<p>such as <paivw, Sokeo, &c. Other editions have vere.

<p>12. Neque vivere lubet. " Life neither possesses any charms," 
</p>
<p>Ite obviam. injuriae. " Set your faces against injustice."-^ Tabes-
</p>
<p>cere. " To fall by degrees to ruin." A metaphor borrowed from
</p>
<p>the effects of a wasting malady on the human frame. The guilt of
</p>
<p>Jugurtha is to prove, if unchecked by Roman power, a corroding
</p>
<p>canker, that will consume by degrees all the prosperity of Nu-
</p>

</p>
<p>fide. Some editions read fama, an old form for famae, the dative.
</p>
<p>We have given the regular form for the dative at once. Fide is by

<p>account.  Asperitatem. " The difficulty of travelling." Literally,
</p>
<p>"the wildness or ruggedness of the country."  Minus frequentata
</p>
<p>sunt. "Are less frequented." Cortius takes frequentata sunt in the
</p>
<p>sense of habitata sunt. The other meaning, however, appears, upon
</p>
<p>a careful examination of the passage, to agree better with the context.
</p>
<p>1. De is haud facile, &c. " Of these I cannot easily speak with J*J

<p>part." Literally, " have set down Africa for a third part." Some
</p>
<p>read in parte tertia. But the best manuscripts are in favour of the

<p>other lection, and the literal translation we have given shows its
</p>
<p>propriety.  Fauci tantummodo, &c. Understand xoluerunt, or

<p>4. Fretum nostri maris et oceani. " The strait connecting our sea
</p>
<p>with the ocean." The straits of Gibraltar are here meant, called
</p>
<p>by the Romans fretum Gaditanum or Herculeum. The Mediter-
</p>
<p>ranean was styled mare nostrum by the Latin writers, from the

<p>circumstance of the Italian peninsula projecting into it.

<p>importuosum apparently contradicts the expression portuosior, ap-
</p>
<p>plied at the close of the preceding chapter to the part of Numidia
</p>
<p>assigned by the Roman commissioners to Adherbal : there, however,
</p>
<p>it only means "better provided with harbours" than the part given
</p>
<p>to Jugurtha, without meaning to convey the idea that they were ma-
</p>
<p>ny in number.

<p>6. Arbori infecundus. Understand ferendae or some equivalent

<p>term. Arbori is put for arboribus.  Coelo, terra, &c. " From the

<p>falls, and the rivers and springs are few in number.  Genus homi-

</p>
<p>sible. The truth of the narrative, however, shall rest with the au-

<p>hostilities any very rapid increase of national strength. It will be
</p>
<p>perceived that Sallust, in the course of this history, makes the

<p>7. Eo processum. " That matters had come to such a pass." 
</p>
<p>Necessario. Equivalent to necessitate coactus, and implying that
</p>
<p>Adherbal only took up arms because absolutely forced so to do. The
</p>
<p>term necessario, therefore, does not appear superfluous in this pas-
</p>
<p>sage, as some contend.  Die extremum. We have here the old
</p>
<p>form of the genitive singular of dies, instead of diei. Compare the
</p>
<p>words of Priscian :  " Veteres frequentissime mveniuntur similem

<p>| Q day) being still as yet obscure."  Partim. " Some.''  Togatorum
</p>
<p>" Of Romans." Referring to the Romans (whether natives of Rome
</p>
<p>or provincials enjoying the rights of citizenship) who were dwelling
</p>
<p>at Cirta for commercial or other purposes. The Romans, from their
</p>
<p>use of the toga, were called gens togata, or 3imply togati. The
</p>
<p>Greeks, from their wearing the pallium, were denominated by the
</p>
<p>Romans, palliati, or gens palliata ; and the Gauls, from their use of
</p>
<p>the braccae, a species of striped under-garments^g-ercs braccata.
</p>
<p>2. Vineis. The vineae were machines in the form of sheds, and
</p>
<p>constructed of wood and hurdles, covered with earth or raw hides,
</p>
<p>or any materials which could not easily be set on fire. They were
</p>
<p>pushed forward by wheels below. "Under them the besiegers either
</p>
<p>worked the ram, or tried to undermine the walls.  Turribusque.
</p>
<p>The turves, or towers, were of two kinds ; fixed and moveable. The
</p>
<p>fixed towers were raised on the agger, or mound, and consisted of
</p>
<p>different stories, from which showers of darts and stones were dis-
</p>
<p>charged by means of engines called catapultae, balistae, and
</p>
<p>scorpiones. The moveable towers were pushed forward and brought
</p>
<p>back on wheels, fixed below, on the inside of the planks. To
</p>
<p>prevent them from being set on fire by the enemy, the towers,
</p>
<p>both fixed and moveable, but more particularly the latter, were
</p>
<p>covered with raw hides, and pieces of coarse cloth, and mattresses.
</p>
<p>3. Tempus legatorum antecapere. " To anticipate the return of
</p>
<p>the ambassadors."  Tres adolescentes. Cortius thinks that these
</p>
<p>words are a mere gloss, and ought to be removed from the text.
</p>
<p>The opinion does not seem very probable, as a copyist would in all
</p>
<p>likelihood have added any thing else rather than these particular
</p>
<p>words. Compare also chapter 25, where it is stated that majores
</p>
<p>natu, nobiles, amplis honoribus, were sent as ambassadors. Tres
</p>
<p>adolescentes, therefore, is in the manner of Sallust.
</p>
<p>4. Telle et censer e. " That it was their wish and determination."

</p>

</p>
<p>his former meritorious conduct.  Ob easdem artis. " That, from
</p>
<p>he exercise of the same good qualities."  Non penuria. "No'.
</p>
<p>from any want."  Adoptatum. This remark of Jugurtha appa-

<p>De remembered that Jugurtha, although taken into Micipsa's family

</p>
<p>death, when the latter had sons who were grown up.

<p>6. Neque recte, nequc pro bono. " Neither justly nor for their

</p>
<p>if a second subject be introduced, se refers to that subject, and is
</p>
<p>should be used for the first. This rule is neglected, however, in
</p>
<p>some instances, where no ambiguity can arise. Thus, in the present
</p>
<p>case, sese can only refer to Jugurtha, and in no way to the Romans.
</p>
<p>7. Utrique digrediuntur. " They each separate," i. e. the am-

<p>bassadors and Jugurtha.  Copia nonfuit. The ambassadors had
</p>
<p>no opportunity afforded them."
</p>
<p>1. Vallo. In besieging a place, the Roman mode, which Ju- 1*J
</p>
<p>gurtha here imitates, was to draw lines composed of a rampart and
</p>
<p>ditch, and sometimes a solid wall of considerable height -and thick
</p>
<p>ness, flanked with towers, at proper distances, around the whole. 
</p>
<p>Turns. Fixed towers are here meant. Consult note 2, page 16

<p>2. Formidinem. " What was calculated to alarm."  Prorsus
</p>
<p>intentus. " Wholly bent on the object he had in view."
</p>
<p>3. Hostem infestum. " That his enemy was implacable against
</p>
<p>him," i. e. was bent on his ruin.  Miserando casum suum. " By

<p>4. Recitatae. "Was read aloud." Legere, "to read," to
</p>
<p>pause with the eyes without uttering any sound. Recitare, "to

<p>read aloud," that others may hear.
</p>
<p>5. Neque vos, &c. This is skilfully framed to excite the indig-
</p>
<p>nation of the Romans against Jugurtha.  In animo habeat. " He
</p>
<p>cares for," i. e. allows to occupy his thoughts.  Quam, Malit,

<p>being equivalent to magis velit, supersedes the necessity of insert-

<p>elegantly used in the sense of haec: "These, I allow, may ha^e
</p>
<p>been our own private wrongs ; they may have been of no concerr.
</p>
<p>to you." The construction ofquisjust alluded to, as also the analo-
</p>
<p>gous usage of the relative for et is, or et ille, take place when no
</p>
<p>particular stress is to be laid on the relative clause.

<p>thing now remains by which he can be shaken from his wicked pur-

</p>
<p>the state."  Senati princeps. Sallust uses senatus as of two declen-
</p>
<p>sions, the second and fourth. The office of princeps senatus, called
</p>
<p>principatus, conferred no command or emolument, but yet was
</p>

<p>much to perspicuity, as well as precision.  Omnis puberes " All
</p>
<p>the young men."  Negotiatores. Referring to the Italian traders.
</p>
<p>Obvius. " Came in contact with."
</p>
<p>2. Ministri. " Tools." Sallust here purposely employs the
</p>
<p>term ministri, to convey to the reader a just idea of the degrading
</p>
<p>conduct of the Roman nobility.  Inter pellando. " By interrupting
</p>
<p>the course of public business."  Gratia. " By their influence with
</p>
<p>individual senators."  Leniebant. " Strove to soften down."
</p>
<p>3. Tribunus plebis. The tribunes of the commons were the famous
</p>
<p>popular magistrates, who, by repeated attacks on the nobility, event-
</p>
<p>ually brought over the government of Rome from an aristocratic to
</p>
<p>a democratical form. They were created originally A. U. C. 260,
</p>
<p>at the time of the secession to the sacred mount, for the purpose
</p>
<p>}f protecting the rights of the people. Their power was almost
</p>
<p>destroyed by Sylla, but was subsequently re-established in the time
</p>
<p>of Pompey and Crassus. They then became mere tools in the
</p>
<p>:iands of the leading men.

</p>
<p>of the nobility."  Potentia. This term generally refers to power of
</p>
<p>our own acquiring ; potestas, to delegated authority. The former
</p>
<p>answers to the Greek term diva^is, the latter to egovaia. Here the
</p>
<p>power of the nobility is called potentia, from its being of a usurped
</p>
<p>character.  Id agi. " That this was in agitation," or more freely

</p>
<p>nation to which the affair had given rise, would have died graduaLy
</p>
<p>away, in consequence of the frequent postponements of their delib-
</p>
<p>erations." The indicative dilapsa erai is here used in place of the
</p>
<p>potential, to give more liveliness to the representation.
</p>
<p>6. Lege Sempronia. Originally their provinces used to be de-
</p>
<p>creed to the consuls by the senate after the election, or when they

</p>
<p>5. Praes6nti consilio. " In presence of the council of war." gO
</p>
<p>The Roman military council was composed of the lieutenant-gene-
</p>
<p>rals, and the tribunes of the soldiers, together with the oldest cen-
</p>
<p>Diron in the legion, the commander-in-chief presiding.  De invidia
</p>
<p>f'acti. " Concerning the odium to which his conduct had given
</p>
<p>rise," i. e. for the purpose of exculpating himself from the odium to
</p>
<p>which, &c.
</p>
<p>6. Quasi per saturam, &c. " The opinions of the council being
</p>
<p>asked in a hasty and confused manner as it were." More literally,
</p>
<p>though less elegantly, "having been taken as it were by the gross
</p>
<p>or lump." We have nothing in English that can answer as a close
</p>
<p>and exact translation of the phrase per saturam. The term satura
</p>
<p>is properly an adjective with lanx understood, and signifies, literally,
</p>
<p>the dish or platter, annually filled with all sorts of fruits, and offered
</p>
<p>to the gods as the first-fruits of the season. From this medley, the
</p>
<p>term is figuratively used in our text to denote a confused and pro-
</p>
<p>miscuous collecting of the votes. In like manner, a lex satura
</p>
<p>(where satura is again merely an adjective, agreeing with lex,) was
</p>
<p>one that embraced many topics unconnected with each other ; and
</p>
<p>it was a rule of the Roman code, that no existing law be abrogated
</p>
<p>by a lex satura, on account of the unfairness of such a mode of pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding, and the facilities which it afforded for taking by surprise.
</p>
<p>So, again, the Latin term satira, takes its name from this source,
</p>
<p>in consequence of the medley of verses of different metres, and
</p>
<p>topics of various natures, which the earlier writers of satire were
</p>
<p>accustomed to employ. Varro even mixed prose with poetry, and
</p>
<p>called these pieces satirae.
</p>
<p>7. Pro consilio. " Before the council." This signification of
</p>
<p>fro is derived immediately from that of the Greek -od.  Ad magis-
</p>
<p>tratus rogandos. " To hold the election for magistrates." More
</p>
<p>literally, " to preside at," &c. The usual beginning of all applica-
</p>
<p>tions to the people was Velitis, jubeatis, Quirites ; and thus the
</p>
<p>people were said to be consulted or asked, (consuli sive rogari,) and

<p>.he presiding magistrate to consult or ask them. Hence rogare
</p>
<p>magistratus, "to create magistrates," or, as here, to preside at theii
</p>
<p>election ; rogare quaesitores, " to appoint commissioners." And
</p>
<p>nence also, rogatio is a " bill," while the matter is still pending,
</p>
<p>Dut lex, " a law," when it has been favourably received by the
</p>
<p>people.
</p>
<p>1. De facto consults agitari. " The conduct of the consul was a 2 1
</p>
<p>theme of conversation."  Gravis invidia. " Deep indignation." 
</p>
<p>Tatres probarentne," &c. In translating this clause, the emphasis

</p>
<p>of an accusative, (as if governed by quod ad understood,) though in
</p>
<p>fact the nominative to probarent. " As to the senate, it was uncer-
</p>
<p>tain whether they would approve of so disnonourable a course of

<p>is the mere production of the historian.  Ac potissumum. Under-
</p>
<p>stand earn orationem.
</p>
<p>3. Dehortantur. The indicative is used here, in the place of the
</p>
<p>subjunctive dehortentur, to impart more force and certainty to the
</p>
<p>sentence. Render the whole clause as follows : " Did not, Ro-
</p>
<p>mans, my zeal for the public welfare overcome every other consid-
</p>
<p>eration, many things would dissuade me from espousing your cause."
</p>
<p>If dehor tar entur and superarent had been employed, the meaning
</p>
<p>would have been : " Had not a regard, &c. overcome every other
</p>
<p>consideration, many thmgs would have dissuaded me," &c

<p>since the death of Tiberius Gracchus, and ten since that of his

</p>
<p>middle period between the two dates.  Quam ludibrio fueritis
</p>
<p>"What a sport you have been," i. e. with what insolent scorn
</p>
<p>you have been treated.  Vestri defensores. Alluding particularly
</p>
<p>to the Gracchi.

<p>is this : If I cannot break the power of the opposite faction, I still wilj
</p>
<p>try to preserve my own freedom. That freedom is the inheritance I
</p>
<p>received from my fathers ; it is my own property, and I will enjoy it

<p>nature of the enterprise. There will be no need of arms, no need 2 J
</p>
<p>of a secession, &c. When he speaks of asserting his own freedom,
</p>
<p>he means of course theirs also, only this way of expressing himself
</p>
<p>is more calculated to arouse their feelings.
</p>
<p>10. Secessione. Three secessions of the people are recorded in
</p>
<p>Roman history. The first took place, A. U. C. 260, on account of
</p>
<p>the severity of creditors, and was made to the sacred mount. The
</p>
<p>second was occasioned by the conduct of Appius Claudius, the
</p>
<p>decemvir, and was made first to the Aventine, and afterwards to
</p>
<p>the sacred mount. It happened, A. U. C. 305. The third was pro
</p>
<p>duced by the same cause as the first, and was made to the Janicu-
</p>
<p>lum, A. U. C. 466.
</p>
<p>11. Suomet more. " In their own way," i. e. by the natural con-
</p>
<p>sequences of their vices and crimes.
</p>
<p>12. Quaestiones habitae sunt. " Severe investigations were in-
</p>
<p>stituted." Velleius Paterculus (2, 6.) informs us, that after the
</p>
<p>murder of Tiberius Gracchus, the consuls Rutilius and Popilius
</p>
<p>pursued very cruel and vigorous measures against the partisans of
</p>
<p>that individual.  Post C. Gracchi et M. Fulvii caedem, &c. Con-

<p>13. Utriusque cladis. " Of either massacre."

<p>14. Sed sanefuerit, &c. " But let it indeed have been an aim-
</p>

</p>
<p>restoration of their rights to the people. Let whatever cannot
</p>
<p>be punished without shedding the blood of Roman citizens, have
</p>
<p>been justly done."  Ulcisci is here used passively, and nequitur is
</p>
<p>the passive form put, by an archaism, for nequit. The passage be-
</p>
<p>fore us is an ironical concession on the part of Memmius, and the
</p>
<p>train of ideas is as follows : I admit that the Gracchi, in seeking to
</p>
<p>restore the rights of the Roman people, were in fact only aiming at
</p>
<p>sovereign power. I am willing to allow, that the nobility, in punish-
</p>
<p>ing with death the attempts of the Gracchi and their partisans, acted
</p>
<p>with strict justice, since these attempts could have been punished

<p>civil and military preferments.  Parum habuere. " They have es-
</p>

</p>
<p>2. Incedunt per or a vestra magnifice. " They move with an air of
</p>
<p>grandeur before your very faces."  Ostentantes. " Displaying with
</p>
<p>insulting parade."  Perinde quasi. " Just as if."
</p>
<p>3. fynperio nati. " Born fcr empire." The dative is here ised
</p>
<p>150 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>OO to denote continuance. The common, but less emphatic form,
</p>
<p>would be, ad imperandum nah.
</p>
<p>4. Occidisse iribunos plebis. " The having put to death tri-
</p>
<p>bunes of the commons." The infinitive is here employed in its
</p>
<p>original force of a verbal noun, governing the case of its verb. So
</p>
<p>caedem in vosfecisse, a little after. The allusion is to the Gracchi.
</p>
<p>The persons of the tribunes were sacred, and whoever injured one
</p>
<p>of these magistrates in word or deed was held accursed, and his
</p>
<p>property was confiscated.
</p>
<p>5. Quaestioncsmiquas. " Iniquitous prosecutions."  Pessumt.
</p>
<p>The adverbs pessume and maxume have here the force of compara-
</p>
<p>tives. The comparative is often used for the superlative in Latin ;
</p>
<p>the construction of the superlative for the comparative is much more
</p>
<p>rare.
</p>
<p>6. Metum a scelere suo, &c. The meaning intended to be con-
</p>
<p>veyed is this : the fear which the nobility ought to entertain on ac-
</p>
<p>count of their crimes, they have made you feel, because you are too
</p>
<p>spiritless to oppose them.  Inter malos f actio. " It is faction when
</p>
<p>found among the wicked."
</p>
<p>7. Quod si tarn libertatis, &c. " But if you had as strong a re-
</p>
<p>gard for the preservation of your own freedom, as they are inflamed
</p>
<p>with the desire of tyrannising over you." Tarn, quam, equivalent
</p>
<p>here to tantam, quantum.  Beneficia vestra. "Your favours. ' The
</p>
<p>consulship, praetorship, priesthood, &c.

<p>8. Bis, per secessionem. Consult note 10, page 21.  Aventinum.
</p>
<p>The Aventine was the most extensive of all the hills on which Rome
</p>
<p>was built. It received its name from an Alban king, who was
</p>
<p>buried on it, and was the spot which Remus chose to take the
</p>
<p>omens. On this last account it was generally regarded as a place
</p>
<p>of evil omen ; and, therefore, according to Aulus Gellius, was not
</p>
<p>included within the Pomaerium. But other and better authorities
</p>
<p>make it to have been joined to the city by Ancus Martius. Com-
</p>

<p>11. Qui si dediticius est, &c. A dilemma. The surrender in 22
</p>
<p>auestion is either real or unreal. If real, the Niimidian will como
</p>
<p>in obedience to your command ; if unreal, he will not come ; but
</p>
<p>then his absence will form the strongest testimony against those
</p>
<p>whom we wish to convict by his evidence when present.
</p>
<p>1. I2a. By ilia temporahe means the period immediately sub- 2^1
</p>
<p>sequent to the slaughter of the Gracchi, when every thing was in
</p>
<p>the hands of the aristocracy. By haec tempora he designates the
</p>
<p>present moment, when the people are beginning to be aroused to an
</p>
<p>asserting of their rights.
</p>
<p>2. Leges, jura. " Laws, justice." The term leges here em-
</p>
<p>braces every thing relating to the admimstration of the state  and
</p>
<p>jura, on the other hand, the rights and privileges of private
</p>
<p>citizens, which rely for support on the impartial dispensing of jus
</p>
<p>tice  Bella, paces. The control of war and peace is here meant.
</p>
<p>Paces, in the plural number, is not very frequent in its occurrence,
</p>
<p>though used, notwithstanding, by some of the best writers. Compare
</p>
<p>Horace, (Ep. 1, 3, 8.) "Bella quis et paces longum diffundit in
</p>
<p>aevum."
</p>
<p>3. Vos autem, &c. He addresses the plebeians merely, but, in
</p>
<p>order to animate them the more, he speaks to them as if they formed
</p>
<p>the true and the whole Roman people, u populus Romanus."
</p>
<p>4. Atque ego. A transition to the danger which threatens unless
</p>
<p>the guilty be punished.  Casura esset. " "Would be likely to end."
</p>
<p>5. Quantum importunitatis habent. Complete the construction
</p>
<p>as follows : Pro tanta importunitate quantum importunitatis habent.
</p>
<p>" Such is their overbearing insolence." Precisely analogous to this
</p>
<p>is the use of the relative in such phrases as the following : " Quae
</p>
<p>tua est virtus expugnabis," i. e. ea virtute, quae virtus tua est,
</p>
<p>expugnabis. " Such is your valour," &c. So again, " cujus est,
</p>
<p>lenitatis Galba promisit." " Galba, with his usual lenity, pro
</p>
<p>mised," i. e. ea lenitate cujus est lenitatis.
</p>

</p>
<p>remain slaves."  Per manus. " By force."
</p>
<p>7. In tarn divorsis mentibus. " Between minds actuated by such
</p>
<p>opposite sentiments."  Peculatus acrarn. " Embezzlement of the
</p>
<p>public money." The speaker is endeavouring to show the full
</p>
<p>enormity of the conduct of Bestia and Scaurus, by comparing it
</p>
<p>with acts of a flagrant nature on the part of others, but which sink,
</p>
<p>by the side of the former, into comparative insignificance.

<p>wood in construction before esse, i. e. eum esse regem. Th term
</p>
<p>rex is here equivalent to " tyrant."
</p>
<p>10. Ad hoc, &c. The idea intended to be conveyed is this : If
</p>
<p>you punish the bad, you deter from the commission of offences ;
</p>
<p>and, if offences be not committed, you will seldom need the aid of
</p>
<p>the good for your protection, and will consequently be under no

</p>
<p>2. Quos pecuniae captae arcessebant. " Whom they accused of
</p>
<p>having taken money," i. e. who were then under accusation of
</p>
<p>bribery. Arcesso, strictly speaking, signifies " to send for," " to
</p>
<p>summon," and has here the force of in jus vocare. We must un
</p>
<p>derstand after it, in construction, the word crimine, which is some-
</p>
<p>times expressed, as veneni crimine arcessi. Suet. Tib. 53.

<p> Veluti tabes. " Like some infection." The primitive meaning

<p>of tabes is " a wasting malady." The term is here employed figu-

</p>
<p>disorder.

<p>clause might be rendered more freely, " With an exterior that was

</p>
<p>was wont to change his dress, lay aside every kind of ornament, let
</p>
<p>his hair and beard grow, and go round in this state to solicit the

<p>favour of tha people.
</p>
<p>6. Magna vis animi. " Great intrepidity," i. e. great firmness
</p>
<p>ofpirpose.  Confirmatus. "Being encouraged." Sallust wishes
</p>
<p>to convey the idea, that Jugurtha not only displayed an intrepid
</p>
<p>spirit on this occasion, but was moreover encouraged by assurances
</p>
<p>of aid from his partisans and friends.  Par at. " He secures the
</p>
<p>assistance of." Literally, " he procures," or makes his own. The

<p>7. De hoste supplicium sumi. " That punishment be inflicted
</p>
<p>upon him as a public enemy."  Dignitati. Some refer this to the

<p>Roman people, others to Memmius. It relates in fact to both, and
</p>
<p>must be rendered, " for honour."  Confirmare. " Assured them."
</p>
<p> Per se. " As far as he could effect this."

<p>8. Verba facit. "He addresses him."  Romae Numidiaque.
</p>
<p>Some editions have Numidiae, in the genitive, which, although re-

<p>ferring to a country, they construe by the rule of names of towns.
</p>
<p>There are not wanting examples of this construction in other Latin

<p>being ordered or requested so to do. Sileo, on the contrary,

<p>is to say nothing, to continue silent, after having been so pre-

<p>1. Terrebat eum. " Sought to terrify him." Eum here refers O^

</p>
<p>tercession, thwart the proceedings of his colleagues, and oppose an

<p>effectual barrier to the wishes of the people. Those who did so,

<p>however, might afterwards be brought to trial by their colleagues

<p>Tiberius Gracchus, when his colleague Octavius opposed the pas-

<p>publicly deposing him by the suffrages of the people.

</p>
<p>154 NOTES TO THE

<p>25 Literally, " which anger loves to be put in operation." An imitation
</p>
<p>of the Greek idiom $i\ti yiyvsadai.
</p>
<p>3. Proxumo anno, &c. The year meant is A. U. C. 644.  Stirpe.
</p>
<p>The term stirps properly denotes that part of the trunk of a tree

<p>where the roots begin to branch out. Hence it is applied figu-
</p>
<p>ratively to the stock or lineage of a family, &c.  Jugurtham oh

<p>4. Belli gerundi. " Of carrying on some war." Of having soma
</p>
<p>war to carry on, in which he might signalize himself.  The consul
</p>
<p>was well aware, that Massiva could not be established on the Numi-
</p>
<p>dian throne without a war.
</p>
<p>5. Movere. Some editions have moveri, but the manuscripts m
</p>
<p>general favour the active form. The construction, though a harsh
</p>
<p>one, is characteristic of Sallust. Movere governs omnia under-
</p>
<p>stood, and omnia expressed is the accusative before senescere. The
</p>
<p>meaning is, that the consul " wished to throw all things into confu-
</p>
<p>sion, than that all should begin to grow torpid" in the arms of re-
</p>
<p>pose.

<p>egressusque, &c. " Carefully ascertains his accustomed routes, his
</p>
<p>hours for leaving home ; in fine, all his places of resort, and his entire

</p>
<p>reason.  Quam ex jure gentium. By the law of nations, the retinue

<p>27 Vid. Geographical Index. The cohort, when full, consisted of 600
</p>
<p>men. The usual number, however, about the time of Polybius,
</p>
<p>was 420.
</p>
<p>3. Centurio primi pili. " The chief centurion." Each Roman
</p>
<p>legion was divided into ten cohorts ; each cohort into three maniples,
</p>
<p>and each maniple into two centuries. So that there were thirty
</p>
<p>maniples and sixty centuries in a legion. There were two centu-
</p>
<p>rions in each maniple, called by the same name, but distinguished
</p>
<p>by the title prior, " former," and posterior, " latter," because the
</p>
<p>one was chosen and ranked before the other. The centurion of the
</p>
<p>first century of the first maniple of the Triarii, was called centurio
</p>
<p>primi pili, or primus pilus, or primopilus, &c. He presided over
</p>
<p>all the other centurions, and had the charge of the eagle (aguila) or
</p>
<p>chief standard of the legion ; whereby he obtained both profit and
</p>
<p>dignity, being ranked among the equites, and having a place in the
</p>
<p>council of war with the consul and tribunes of the soldiers. The
</p>
<p>centurion of the second century of the first maniple of the Triarii
</p>
<p>was called primipilus posterior. So the two centurions of the second
</p>
<p>maniple of the Triarii were called prior centurio, and posterior cen-
</p>
<p>turio, secundipili ; and so on to the tenth, the two centurions of which
</p>
<p>were styled centurio decimipili prior, and posterior. In like manner
</p>
<p>primus princeps prior, and posterior; secundus princeps prior,
</p>
<p>and posterior, in speaking of the principes or second rani 1 ; and
</p>
<p>primus hastatus, &c, in reference to the hastati or first rank.
</p>
<p>Thus there was a large field for promotion in the Roman irmy :
</p>
<p>from a common soldier to a centurion ; and from being the towest
</p>
<p>centurion of the tenth maniple of the hastati (decimus hastatus pos-
</p>
<p>terior) to the rank of primipilus.
</p>
<p>4. Hostes, quo minus, &c. " Prevented the enemy from ma ing
</p>
<p>an advantageous use of their victory."  Sub jugum. " Under the
</p>
<p>yoke." Two spears stuck in the ground, and crossed by another
</p>
<p>at the top, like a gallows, received the name of jugum. Under thij
</p>

<p>5. Quia mortis metu mutabantur. " Because they were received

<p>m exchange for the fear of death." Metu is put in the ablative, as
</p>
<p>marking the instrument, or means which effected the exchange, the
</p>
<p>fear of death compelling the Roman soldiery to this disgraceful step.
</p>
<p>Some editions have nutabant, " they wavered/ or " were irreso-

</p>
<p>general name of Latins. The Latins constituted the chief strength
</p>
<p>cf the Roman armies. They were not, however, embodied in the
</p>
<p>legions, and were treated with more severity than Roman citizens,
</p>
<p>being punished with stripes, and also capitally, from which citizens
</p>
<p>were exempted by the Porcian law.  The Socii mentioned in the
</p>
<p>text, were the other Italian allies. Their general treatment was the
</p>
<p>same as that of the Latins.
</p>
<p>2. Provincia. The Roman province is here meant, which has
</p>
<p>already been alluded to in the 19th chapter.  Mederi fralzrnae
</p>
<p>invidiae. " To allay the odium to which his brother's misconduct

<p>employed by the historian to denote, by their almost synonymous

<p>28 caprice. " In the absence of positive proof, mere idle rumours and

<p>popular feeling were made to supply its place.
</p>
<p>oq I. Mos partium popularium, &c. " The custom of having a
</p>
<p>popular party, and another in the senate," i. e. the existence of a
</p>
<p>popular and an aristocratic party. The plural is here employed
</p>
<p>(partium  factionum) not for the purpose of showing that there were
</p>
<p>several distinct parties among the people and senate, but that from
</p>
<p>this tune the people and senate respectively formed themselves into
</p>
<p>parties against each other. As the words mos partium would alone
</p>
<p>suffice to convey the meaning of Sallust, some editors reject the
</p>
<p>remainder of the clause popularium, et senati factionum.
</p>
<p>2. Malarum artium. " Evil practices."  Paucis ante annis.
</p>
<p>Carthage had been destroyed thirty-five years before the breaking
</p>
<p>out of the Jugurthine war.  Metus hostilis. " Fear of their
</p>
<p>enemies." Put for metus hostium.  Scilicet. Used here as an
</p>
<p>explanatory particle. Hence the clause may be rendered as follows :
</p>
<p>" Those effects which prosperity is accustomed to produce, licen-
</p>
<p>tiousness, namely, and pride, came naturally upon them," "i. e.
</p>
<p>licentiousness and pride, the usual attendants of prosperity, natu-
</p>
<p>rally made their appearance.
</p>
<p>3. Asperius acerliusque fuit. Understand quam ipsae res
</p>
<p>adversae fuerant. " Proved a harsher and more galling visitation
</p>
<p>than adversity itself had been." The res adversae allude to the
</p>
<p>reverses in the second Punic war.
</p>
<p>4. Dignitatem, &c. What grammarians call a zeugma takes
</p>
<p>place in lubidinem, which has one meaning when connected with
</p>
<p>dignitatem, and another with libertatem. Render the whole clause
</p>
<p>as follows : " For the nobility began to convert their high rank into
</p>
<p>an instrument of tyranny, the people to degrade their freedom into
</p>
<p>licentiousness."
</p>
<p>5. Ducere, trahere, rapere. " Dishonestly acquired, dragged
</p>
<p>away, made plunder of, every thing." These words, arranged as
</p>
<p>they are in the text, are employed to express the progress of corrup-

<p>8. Ex nobilitate. Alluding to the two Gracchi, who were of the

<p>gens Cornelia. Cortius regards these words as a mere gloss, in-
</p>
<p>correctly, as we conceive.  Permixtio civilis, &c. "A civil com-
</p>
<p>motion, like a parting asunder of the earth."

<p>9. Quorum majores. Tiberius and Caius Gracchus were grand-
</p>
<p>sons, on the side of their mother Cornelia, of the elder Afric anus. 
</p>
<p>Vindicare plebem in liber tatem. " To assert the freedom of the

<p>commons."  Societatis.' The equites, placed between the patri
</p>
<p>cians and plebeians, as a kind of connecting link, were in general
</p>
<p>dissatisfied with this intermediate rank, and had a strong inclination
</p>
<p>for an alliance with the nobility and admission to senatorian honours.

<p>passage of an agrarian law.  Coloniis deducendis. " For planting
</p>
<p>colonies." Colonies were commonly led out and planted by three
</p>
<p>commissioners, (triumviri). Sometimes five, ten, or more were
</p>
<p>appointed. The people determined in what way the lands were to
</p>
<p>be divided, and to whom they were to be assigned. The new co

<p>lony marched to its destined place in the form of an army, with

<p>3Q hardly required by the idiom of the language. Sallast does nrt

<p>mean that Metellus neglected the other duties of the consulship, in

<p>order to give his whole attention to the war, supposing that his col-
</p>
<p>league would attend to every thing else : but that he foresaw he
</p>
<p>could not expect much assistance from him, in these warlike prepa-
</p>
<p>rations, and therefore paid more attention to them himself, though
</p>
<p>without neglecting, at the same time, his general duties as a consul.
</p>
<p>6. Bello vario. " In a war, exposed to various contingencies."
</p>
<p>The nature of the country, which was to be the scene of operations,

<p>and the character of the foe, are here alluded to. Ad ea patranda,

<p>their preparing the food of the soldiers. Independently of its refer-
</p>
<p>ring to the soldiers' servants and to the sutlers, the name appears
</p>
<p>to have been occasionally also applied to buffoons. This last mean

<p>ing of the word rests on a passage in Justin, (38, 10,) where, un-
</p>
<p>der the general name of lixae, are comprehended coqui, pistores,

<p>and scenici, Justin is speaking of the army which Antiochus led

<p>Q 1 place. The form of the samp was square. In later ages, in imita
</p>
<p>tion of the Greeks, they sometimes made it circular, or adapted it .
</p>
<p>to the nature of the ground. The ditch was usually nine feet deep,
</p>
<p>and twelve feet broad. The vallum was composed of the earth
</p>
<p>dug from the ditch, and secured and kept firm by stakes.
</p>
<p>8. Circumire. " He went the rounds. " In general, certain per
</p>
<p>sons were appointed every night to go round the watches, hence
</p>
<p>called circuitores or circitores. This seems to have been at first
</p>
<p>done by the equites and tribuni ; on extraordinary occasions, as in
</p>
<p>the present instance, by the commander in person, attended by his
</p>
<p>legati. Subsequently, regular persons were chosen for that pur
</p>
<p>pose by the tribuni. (Vegetius, 3, 8.)

<p>32 * Conjirmavit. " He restored to its former efficiency."
</p>
<p>2. Innocentia. " His incorruptible integrity."  Cum supplicus.
</p>
<p>" With the emblems of submission." By supplicia, in this sense
</p>
<p>are usually meant branches of olive. The customs, however, of
</p>
<p>different nations varied in this respect. According to the scholiast
</p>
<p>on Sophocles, (Oed. T. 3,) petitioners among the Greeks, usually
</p>
<p>carried boughs wrapped around with fillets of wool. Sometimes
</p>
<p>the hands were covered with these fillets, not only among the
</p>
<p>Greeks, but also among the Romans. Hence in Plautus, (Amph.
</p>
<p>1, 1, 101,) we have the expression " velatis manibus"
</p>
<p>3. Experiments. " By actual trials," i. e. by experience.  Infi-
</p>
<p>dum, " as faithless."  Legates alium ab alio, &c. " He addresses
</p>
<p>himself to each of the ambassadors apart from the others."  Ten-
</p>
<p>tando. " By tampering with them."  Opportunos. " Fit for his
</p>
<p>purpose."  Maxume. " By all means."  Necatum. " After they
</p>
<p>had assassinated him."

<p>4. Contra belli faciem. " Contrary to the appearance which
</p>
<p>war usually presents."  Mapalibus. In the 18th chapter of this
</p>
<p>narrative, Sallust uses the term mapaha to designate huts. Here,
</p>
<p>however, tuguria evidently has that meaning, and mapalia de-
</p>
<p>notes "villages." Compare note 2, page 14.  Commeatum par-

<p>tare. " To carry his provisions," i. e. to furnish v c the
</p>
<p>transportation of his provisions. The advantage r to Me-
</p>
<p>tellus from this offer, would be the releasing the soldi from a
</p>
<p>part of the heavy loads they were accustomed carry. The
</p>
<p>strict rule was, that each soldier should carry provisions for fifteen
</p>
<p>days. The whole load of a Roman soldier was sixty pounds, ex-
</p>
<p>clusive of his arms. These last he was taught by active and severe
</p>
<p>exercise to consider a part of himself.

<p>an ambuscade was sought by the enemy," i. e. that the enemy were QJJ
</p>
<p>oniv seeking a spot where they might entrap him, when thrown off
</p>
<p>his guard by these marks of submission. Most editions read ten-
</p>
<p>tare. Cortius understands before this last homines quosdam, or
</p>
<p>something equivalent. Others make tentare the historical infinitive,
</p>
<p>and refer it to Metellus. According to both these explanations,
</p>
<p>however, the reading tentare would seem to want spirit.
</p>
<p>6. V elites. " The light-armed troops." They were first insti-
</p>
<p>tuted in the second Punic war, according to Livy (26, 4). They
</p>
<p>did not form part of the legion, and had no certain post assigned
</p>
<p>them, but fought in scattered parties where occasion required,
</p>
<p>usually before the lines.  Perniciosior. " More mischievous," or
</p>
<p>" hurtful."
</p>
<p>7. Forum rerum venalium, &c. " The most frequented mart,
</p>
<p>for buying and selling commodities, in the whole kingdom." Sal-
</p>
<p>lust here, by his use of the term forum, imitates the Roman way of
</p>
<p>speaking. The word forum, when applied to towns, meant places
</p>
<p>where markets were held, and where justice also was administered.
</p>
<p>The reference in the text is to the first part of this meaning, namely
</p>
<p>Vaga's being a market-town and place of trade.
</p>
<p>1. Huic consul, &c. We have here followed the reading of the JJJJ
</p>
<p>Bipont edition, which alone appears to afford an intelligible meaning
</p>
<p>for this much-contested passage. The phrase huic praesidium im~
</p>
<p>posuit is the true Latin idiom, though, in translating it into our own,
</p>
<p>we are compelled to give huic the force of an ablative. The mean-
</p>
<p>ing of the passage will be as follows : " In this place, the consul
</p>
<p>stationed a garrison, as well for the sake of trying Jugurtha, as
</p>
<p>of watching the result of his own plans, in case the advantages
</p>
<p>which the place afforded should allow this to be done," i. e. for the
</p>
<p>sake of sounding the real intentions of Jugurtha, and of ascertaining
</p>
<p>whether he actually desired peace or was only seeking to lay an
</p>
<p>ambuscade, and also of w T atching the result of his own plans for the
</p>
<p>assassination or seizure of Jugurtha by the ambassadors ; if, upon

<p>trial, the place should prove as advantageous for these two objects
</p>
<p>as he expected it would.
</p>
<p>2. Frequentiam negotiatorum, &c. " That the great number of
</p>
<p>merchants residing there, would both aid his army with supplies
</p>
<p>and be a means of security to the conquests he had already made,'
</p>
<p>i. e, would both readily procure supplies for his army, and, when
</p>
<p>once they had brought their property into the town for that purpose,
</p>
<p>would be willing to defend it with him against Jugurtha. We have

<p>manner of Sallust.  Turmas atque manipulos. The expressions
</p>
<p>turmae and manipuli are here employed by Sallust, either to denote
</p>
<p>that Jugurtha had introduced the Roman discipline among his troops,
</p>
<p>or else in accordance with the general custom of Roman writers,
</p>
<p>who apply to other nations terms and modes of expressions which

<p>only suit themselves.

</p>
<p>the enemy. 3. Ne pauciores cum pluribus. No inferiority of num-

<p>bers. 4. Aut rudes cum hello melioribus. No want of discipline.
</p>
<p> Render prudences, " they, acquainted with the country before
</p>
<p>hand."
</p>
<p>2. Ut quemque, &c. "As he had distinguished any one, on ac-
</p>
<p>count of some military exploit, with a gift of money or with promo
</p>
<p>tion in the army."
</p>
<p>3. Conspicatur. Thus far Salltist has shown us Jugurtha, ac-
</p>
<p>ively employed among his followers. He now changes the picture,
</p>
<p>si presents us with Metellus, ignorant of the position of the foe,
</p>
<p>descending the mountain, and merely observing something that
</p>
<p>wore an unusual appearance on the neighbouring hill. Hence we see
</p>
<p>the propriety of conspicatur (" espies something" on the hill) as a
</p>
<p>reading, instead of the common lection, conspicitur (" is seen" by the
</p>
<p>enemy). Metellus saw something on the hill, but it was too unde-
</p>
<p>fined to enable him to ascertain its nature with any kind of certainty
</p>
<p>until he came nearer.
</p>
<p>4. Quidnam insolita facies ostenderet. " What the strange ap-
</p>
<p>pearance meant."  Equi Numidaeque. " The Numidians, both
</p>
<p>horse and foot." Thus equi virique signifies both horsemen and
</p>
<p>infantry.
</p>
<p>5. Incerti, quidnam esset. " Leaving it uncertain what the thing
</p>
<p>actually was," i. e. not entirely discernible. The term incerti refers
</p>
<p>of course to the Numidians. The adjective certus is derived from
</p>
<p>cerno and res incerta is nothing more than res non bene et distincte
</p>
<p>visa. The primitive meaning therefore oiincertus is " about which
</p>
<p>there is no certainty," "undefined," "not clearly discernible." And
</p>
<p>it is used so in the present instance. Compare the Greek form of
</p>
<p>expression, aSrjXoi ri ttots tovt av eirj.
</p>
<p>6. Agmen constitit. " He halted his army." Consisto, although
</p>
<p>apparently a neuter verb in most cases, is in reality active ; thus
</p>
<p>cousnrit, " he stopped," understand se. In the present instance, the

<p>accusative agmen is expressed, and the common reading constituit
</p>
<p>is not needed. Compare Caes. B. C. 1, 51. li Afranius copias
</p>
<p>eductt, et in medio colle sub castris constitit."
</p>
<p>7. Commutatis ordinibus. " Having altered the arrangement of
</p>
<p>his troops." Jugurtha, it will be recollected, had drawn up his
</p>
<p>forces on the hill, which extended in the direction of the river, and
</p>
<p>at right angles to the mountain. Metellus was descending this
</p>
<p>mountain in order to reach the river, and consequently had Jugur-
</p>
<p>tha's ambuscade on his right flank. Thus far the Roman army would
</p>
<p>appear, from chapter 46, to have been marching in a single column,
</p>
<p>66 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>34 each legion composing that column being divided, in the usual man-
</p>
<p>ner, into three raiiks of hastati, principes, and triarii. The moment
</p>
<p>Metellus perceives his danger, he converts his flank into a front, by
</p>
<p>wheeling the legions out of column into line on the right, and by
</p>
<p>bringing all the hastati of the several legions into one line ; all the
</p>
<p>principes into a second line, and all the triarii into a third. The
</p>
<p>army is then drawn up in three lines, (triplicibus sulsidiis,) with its
</p>
<p>front facing the enemy. But how is it to reach the plain 1 Evi-
</p>
<p>dently by a flank march on the left, and in this flank march the
</p>
<p>three ranks become so many files. Each soldier, therefore, when
</p>
<p>the word is given to continue the march down the mountain, faces
</p>
<p>to the left and moves on in file. If the enemy attacks them on
</p>
<p>their march, they face again to the front and oppose them. Compare,
</p>
<p>in furthsr explanation of this movement, Polybius, (Lips, de Milit.
</p>
<p>Rom. lib. 5, dial. 12). 'ILirsiSav Trpoci:i7rTri ri rZyv Ssivoov, irorl plv -nap*

</p>
<p>8. Triplicibus subsidiis. " In three lines." The term subsidta,
</p>
<p>which properly denotes " bodies of reserve," is here applied to the
</p>
<p>several lines, with reference to the mutual support which they afford
</p>
<p>to each other.
</p>
<p>9. Inter manipulos. " In the vacant spaces between the mani-

<p>" Would try the effects of weariness and thirst on his men."
</p>
<p>11. Sicuti monte descender at. " In the same order in which he
</p>
<p>had descended from the mountain."  Post principia. " In the cen-
</p>
<p>tre." Literally, " after the van." By the new movement of Me
</p>
<p>tellus, the cavalry of the left wing became the leading division on the
</p>
<p>march, and are hence called principes. The station of Marius
</p>
<p>was after the cavalry and the heads of the columns of infantry,
</p>
<p>and consequently about the centre of the line of march.  Prin-

<p>right wing, who are called the rear in reference to the direction of
</p>
<p>the Roman march by files.  Pars a sinistra ac dexter a tentare

</p>
<p>These words refer to a state of things immediately following a new JJg
</p>
<p>movement on the part of the Romans, and of which movement Sal-
</p>
<p>lust says nothing, leaving it to be inferred by the reader. When
</p>
<p>the Romans were first attacked by the enemy, they were proceeding
</p>
<p>in a long column down to the plain, having wheeled into that order
</p>
<p>from the previous line of march. Hence by primi, in this new
</p>
<p>arrangement, are meant those who formed the left wing in the old
</p>
<p>order of things, and by postremi, those who composed the old right.
</p>
<p>The primi of Jugurtha's men, on the other hand, are the left wing
</p>
<p>of the Numidians as they lie in ambuscade. The Numidians attack
</p>
<p>the postremi of Metellus, (postremos caedere,) and the moment this
</p>
<p>attack is made on the Roman flank, it faces to the right and forms
</p>
<p>a front against the enemy. This is the movement of which Sal-
</p>
<p>lust says nothing. When it is made, the head and rear of the Ro-
</p>
<p>man column become respectively a new left and right wing, and
</p>
<p>the Numidians attack them on each of these new flanks, (pars a
</p>
<p>sinistra acdextera tentare.)
</p>
<p>3. Ludificati incerto praelio. " Baffled by this irregular mode of
</p>
<p>fighting."  Ipsi modo eminus sauciabantur. " Were themselves
</p>
<p>alone wounded from a distance," i. e. they could not wound the
</p>
<p>enemy in return.
</p>
<p>4. Numero prior es. "Being superior in number." Referring
</p>
<p>to the Numidians.  Disjectos ab tergo aut lateribus. The terms
</p>
<p>tergum and latus are here applied not to the entire Roman
</p>
<p>army, but merely to the parties or bands which pursued the Nu-
</p>
<p>midians.
</p>
<p>5. Ea. The ablative. Understand fuga, and render as follows :

</p>
<p>meaning intended to be conveyed by Sallust appears to be this.
</p>
<p>The Romans were fatigued by a long march, and the throwing up
</p>
<p>the works of a camp, as well as by their exertions in the fight,
</p>
<p>and were at the same time rejoiced at their victory. But although
</p>
<p>in this state, and desirous, under the influence of these feelings, ol
</p>
<p>sitting down and enjoying their triumph quietly, rather than com-
</p>
<p>mence a new march, with the chance of a second battle, they never-
</p>
<p>theless moved forth to meet Metellus, because he delayed longer
</p>
<p>than they thought he should. The whole passage, therefore, may
</p>
<p>be rendered as follows : " The Romans, however, though they

</p>
<p>abouts.  Ut sese victus gereret. "How he conducted himself

<p>and pasturage, rather than with war," i. e. composed of husbandmen
</p>
<p>and herdsmen rather than of soldiers.
</p>

<p>More literally, "so the habits of the nation have themselves." This
</p>
<p>custom of abandoning their general after a defeat is always charac-
</p>
<p>teristic of a semi-barbarous nation, and was of constant occurrence
</p>
<p>among the uncivilized communities of antiquity.
</p>
<p>9. Ferocem. "Unsubdued."  Ex illius lubidine. "According
</p>
<p>to his pleasure." Jugurtha was enabled, by retreating rapidly to

<p>parts of the country, known to himself, and not to the Romans,
</p>
<p>to give the enemy an opportunity of fighting only when he himself

<p>2. Plerumque. Agreeing with exercitum. This adjective is
</p>
<p>rarely used in the singular. In early Latinity, plerus,  a,  um,
</p>
<p>were often employed without any syllabic adjection, and hence the

<p>victorious by his valour ; was becoming master of the enerny'e

</p>
<p>5. Supplicia. "A thanksgiving." When a general had obtained
</p>
<p>an important victory, a thanksgiving was decreed by the senate to
</p>
<p>be made in the various temples. What was called a Lectisternium
</p>
<p>then took place, when couches were spread for the gods, as if about .
</p>
<p>to feast, and their statues were taken down from their pedestals,
</p>
<p>and placed upon these couches around the altars, which were loaded
</p>
<p>with the richest dishes.
</p>
<p>6. Laeta agere. " Gave loose to joy," i. e. agebat laetanegotia,
</p>
<p>equivalent in fact to laeta erat. The term gaudium denotes prop-
</p>
<p>erly the feeling of joy, or joy of a comparatively moderate kind.
</p>
<p>Laetitia refers to the expression of joy, by words and gestures, and
</p>
<p>hence is much stronger in meaning than gaudium. A similar dif-
</p>
<p>ference exists between gaudere and laetari.
</p>
<p>7. Praeclara esse. For praeclara erat.  Victoriam. " A de-
</p>
<p>cisive victory."  Necubi. Equivalent to tie alicubi. So ne quis
</p>
<p>for ne aliquis.  Opportunus. " Exposed." Open to attack.
</p>
<p>8. Effuso exercitu. " With his army scattered over the country."
</p>
<p> Cohortes. Referring to the cohorts of the allies. If the legionary
</p>
<p>troops had been meant, the term legiones, or the expression cohortes
</p>
<p>legionariae would have been employed.  Praesidium agitabant.
</p>
<p>" Acted as a convoy." Formed a convoy or guard. Equivalent
</p>
<p>to praesidio erant.

<p>taken as an adverb.

<p>2. Perfugis. The term perfuga denotes a deserter from our
</p>
<p>enemies to us, and trans fuga, one from us to our enemies. Com-
</p>
<p>pare the remark of Popma : " Trans fuga suos r&xnqutt et ad alios

</p>
<p>who were either crucified or beheaded by the elder Africanus ; of
</p>
<p>others who were exposed to wild beasts by the younger Africanus ,
</p>
<p>and of others whom Paulus Aemilius ordered to be trampled under
</p>
<p>foot by elephants, (2, 7). Hence it follows, that the punishment
</p>
<p>of deserters was left to the pleasure of the commander.

</p>
<p>tained by Jugurtha as mentioned in chapter 52.
</p>
<p>5. In porta. " In the very gate of the city." Referring to Sicca.
</p>
<p> Casum. "An opportunity."  Sese. Alluding to himself, Ju-
</p>
<p>gurtha.  Bios. The people of Sicca.  Inferre signa. " To ad-

<p>vance." To move straight onward. Referre signa, " to retreat."
</p>
<p>Convertere signa, " to face about." Conferre signa, " to engage."
</p>
<p>6. Fidem mutavissent. " Would have changed sides." Would
</p>
<p>have broken the faith they had pledged to the Romans, after the
</p>
<p>defeat of Jugurtha, and gone over to their former master.
</p>
<p>7. Infensi intentique. " Full of hostile ardour and on the alert."
</p>
<p> Alii. Opposed to pars. Some editions have evadere alii before
</p>
<p>alii succedere, but this is very properly rejected by others. The
</p>
<p>assailants were only of two classes, those who fought from a dis-
</p>
<p>tance (eminus), and those who advanced to the ramparts (succedere),
</p>
<p>and attempted at one time to undermine, at another to scale, *be
</p>
<p>walls.
</p>
<p>1. Pice et sulphur e taedam mixtam. " Torches besmeared with AQ
</p>

</p>
<p>and ardentia (" all on fire") is put in the neuter gender as .referring
</p>
<p>to sudes, pila and taedam, things without life. The pila had com-
</p>
<p>bustibles attached to them.  The reading we have adopted, is that
</p>
<p>of Gruter. Cortius, however, gives the following : sudes, pila, prae-
</p>
<p>terea picem sulphur e et taeda mixtam, ardentia mittere.

<p>3. Castra hostium. This is one of the very few passages where

<p>Sallust applies the term hostes to his own countrymen, in contradis-

<p>tinction to the Numidians.
</p>
<p>4. Quisque pro moribus. " Each, according to his character."

</p>
<p>they were his own men." Literally, "his countrymen."  Statim,.
</p>
<p>This adverb is not redundant here as some imagine. Metellus first

<p>quickly despatched the cavalry, and, immediately after, Marius with

<p>the allied cohorts.

<p>7. Inultos. " Unpunished." Without taking ample vengeance

<p>Roman line, they gave the enemy, now almost conquered, into the
</p>
<p>hands of their light-armed infantry, who were intermingled with

<p>the horse. The Romans, it will be perceived, are here again called

</p>
<p>have 10 singular, or are used in a different sense in that number ;
</p>
<p>or e.se, whose singular is of rare occurrence. Thus, una moenia,
</p>
<p>ina castra, unae liter ae, &c. In the present instance the singular
</p>
<p>lumber of scala is rarely, if ever, met with, and hence the plural
</p>
<p>Orm is employed. Charisius, Diomedes, and other grammarians,
</p>
<p>naintain that the singular of this word is never used. Compare
</p>
<p>Quintilian, 1, 5, 16 :  " Scala tamen et scopa, contraque hordea et
</p>
<p>mulsa, licet liter arum mutationem, detr -actionem, adjectionem non
</p>
<p>habeant, non alio vitiosa sunt quam quod pluralia singulariter, et
</p>
<p>singularia pluraliter efferuntur." Celsus, however, (8. 15,) uses
</p>
<p>ehe singular of scala : thus, " Sic brachium deligatum super scalae
</p>
<p>gallinariae gradum trajicitur ;" and also Caius, (Dig. lib. 46. tit
</p>
<p>2. leg. 56,) " Qui scalam commodaverit ad ascendendum."

<p>174 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>43 1. Ad imperandum. The gerund is here used, according to (he
</p>
<p>grammarians, in the passive sense, " for the purpose of being or-
</p>
<p>dered," i. e. " of receiving orders." A few other passages occor,
</p>
<p>in the Latin writers now extant, in which the gerund is similarly
</p>
<p>employed. In the present instance, however, an active meaning,
</p>
<p>though not a very elegant one, may be given to imperandum, " for
</p>
<p>the purpose of an ordering of him on the part of Metellus," i. e.
</p>
<p>"for the purpose of Metellus's ordering him." In this same way,
</p>
<p>perhaps, the other instances may be explained. Thus, Nep. Att. 9,
</p>
<p>" Spes restituendi nulla erat." " There was no hope of his being
</p>
<p>restored," i. e. " of a restoring of him ;" and again, Justin, 17, 5,
</p>
<p>" Athenas erudiendi gratia missus." " He was sent to Athens, for
</p>
<p>the sake of being instructed," i. e. for an instructing of himself.
</p>
<p>2. Flectere animum suum. "To change his resolve." To
</p>
<p>waver.
</p>
<p>3. Multis magnisque praesidiis. "Many and great resources "
</p>
<p>Money, horses, arms, elephants.
</p>
<p>4. Numidiam Metello decreverat. Metellus's consulship having
</p>
<p>expired, he was continued in command another year, as proconsul,
</p>
<p>and the province of Numidia was voted to him by the senate. The
</p>
<p>consuls for this year (A. U. C. 646.) were Servius Sulpicius Galba
</p>
<p>and Q. Hortensius, in the place of which latter M. Aurelius
</p>
<p>Scaurus was afterwards chosen.
</p>
<p>5. C. Mario. Marius was a complete slave to superstition, as
</p>
<p>might well be expected in an ignorant and uneducated man. Plu-
</p>
<p>tarch and Frontinus both make mention of a Syrian woman, named
</p>
<p>Martha, whom he carried about with him, and who, as he pretended,
</p>
<p>and very likely believed, was possessed of the gift of prophecy.
</p>
<p>6. Agitabat. " He was meditating."  Cuncta prosper a even-
</p>
<p>tura. The adjective prosper a is here used adverbially. Compare
</p>
<p>Catiline, chap. 26. "Quae occulte tentaverat, aspera foedaque
</p>
<p>evenerant."
</p>
<p>7. Praeter vetustatem familiae. " Except antiquity of family."

<p>13. In potestatibus. " In the exercise of authority."  Ampliore
</p>
<p>M Of a higher office."
</p>
<p>14. Ad id locorum. " Up to that time." Locus is here used
</p>
<p>for tempus. Compare chapter 72. " Post id locorum" i. e. postea.
</p>
<p>So Terence uses inter ea loci for interea, and Plautus interibi.

</p>
<p>2. Jure. "With good reason." On account of his low birth,
</p>
<p>and want of proper education.

</p>
<p>this, by the state of public affairs," i. e. as soon as he, Marius,
</p>
<p>could be spared from the army.
</p>
<p>4. Satis mature. " Soon enough."  Cum filio suo. With his

</p>
<p>5. Annos natus, &c. As the strictly legal age for obtaining the
</p>
<p>consulship was 43 years, Marius, according to the ironical advice
</p>
<p>of Metellus, would have to wait 23 years longer : and as we may
</p>
<p>suppose Marius to have been, at the time here alluded to, at least
</p>
<p>43 years, (since he entertained thoughts of then standing for the
</p>
<p>consulship,) he would have to delay his suit until he was 66 years
</p>
<p>old. Compare Plutarch's account of this same matter, at the con-
</p>
<p>elusion of note 3, page 47, of this narrative.

</p>
<p>ambition."
</p>
<p>7. Ambitiosum. " Calculated to gain popularity."  Laxiore im-
</p>
<p>perio. "Under a more relaxed discipline. "  Negotiator es. The
</p>
<p>negotiator es, especially under the republic, were they who remained
</p>
<p>for some considerable time in one particular place, whether at Re me
</p>
<p>or in the provinces. The mercatores, on the contrary, remained a
</p>
<p>very short time in any place ; they visited many countries, and
</p>
<p>were almost constantly occupied with importing or exporting arti-
</p>
<p>cles of merchandise.

<p>11. Secundum heredem. By haeres secundus (next or second
</p>
<p>heir) among the Romans, was meant the individual to whom the
</p>
<p>inheritance descended, if the heir or heirs who were first appointed
</p>
<p>did not choose to accept, or died under the age of puberty.

</p>
<p>when he presided in a council of war, or in judgment, or gave audi-
</p>
<p>ence to ambassadors. His lieutenants, or legati, and other person?
</p>
<p>of distinction, took places around him ; and if a king happened to be
</p>
<p>in the army, he sat next to the general on his right hand. The

<p>and the dies festi were the same with the dies nefasti, or days on

<p>passing, which would have been expressed by quae agebantur.
</p>
<p>46 1- Trepidare ad arc em oppidi. " Hurried in great confusion to

<p>Infirmissumo generi. " The feeblest portion of the human race,"

<p>i. e. women and boys.

<p>testabilisque. " Infamous," or, " detestable." The word properly
</p>
<p>denotes one who can neither make a will, be a witness, nor receive
</p>
<p>a testamentary bequest. Sallust, in his account of the conduct of
</p>
<p>Turpilius, does not agree with Plutarch, who makes the accusation

<p>to have been a false one, and Turpilius to have been condemned

<p>through the agency of Marius. Compare note 3, page 47. '

<p>Romans divided the natural day, or the space from sunrise to sunset,
</p>
<p>into twelve hours, which were of course shorter in winter and longer
</p>
<p>in summer. At the equinoxes, the third hour would exactly coin-
</p>
<p>cide with our ninth. The night was divided into four watches, each
</p>
<p>consisting of three hours, which were likewise of a different length
</p>
<p>at different times of the year. Thus hora sextanoctis, " midnight."
</p>
<p> Septima, " one o'clock in the morning," &c.
</p>
<p>6. Abnuentis omnia. "Entirely averse to any farther exertion."
</p>
<p>Sallust does not mean that the troops now openly refused obedience
</p>
<p>to orders, but that, by their looks and gestures, they plainly expressed
</p>
<p>ItTGURTHINE WAR. 179
</p>
<p>Page,
</p>
<p>their unwillingness to proceed. This is extremely well indicated by fi
</p>
<p>abnuentis.
</p>
<p>7. Mille passuum. " A mile." Literally, " a thousand paces."
</p>
<p>The Roman passus, or, "pace," was equal to one yard, 1.85375
</p>
<p>feet of English measure, and, consequently, the Roman mile was
</p>
<p>1617 yards, 2.75 feet.
</p>
<p>8. Praedam benigne ostentat. " He generously offers them the
</p>
<p>booty of the place."  Inprimo. Understand agmine.  Late. The
</p>
<p>object of this arrangement was that the cavalry might conceal from
</p>
<p>view the infantry behind them.
</p>
<p>9. Numidas equites. It is now seen why these were stationed
</p>
<p>m front.  Rursum. Referring to their change of opinion. Render
</p>
<p>the clause, " having changed their opinion, and thought it was
</p>
<p>Jugurtha."
</p>
<p>1. Volgum. The ancient writers generally prefer volgum or A^
</p>
<p>vulgum, in the accusative, to volgus or vulgus.  Effusum. " That
</p>
<p>had poured out in great numbers."
</p>
<p>2. Ex perfidia. "After their treachery."  Poenae cuncta, &c.
</p>
<p>* Was entirely given up to punishment or plunder." Poenae fuit
</p>
<p>is an unusual form of expression, but does not offend when placed
</p>
<p>in the same sentence with the more usual construction praedae fuit.
</p>
<p>3. Capite poenas solvit. According to Plutarch, Turpilius and
</p>
<p>his family had long been retainers to that of Metellus, and he
</p>
<p>attended him in this war in the character of master of the artificers.
</p>
<p>Marius, who was one of the council of war that tried him, was not
</p>
<p>only himself severe against him, but stirred up most of the other
</p>
<p>judges ; so that it was carried against the opinion of Metellus, and
</p>
<p>it was much against his will that he passed upon him sentence of
</p>
<p>death. A short time afterwards, according to Plutarch, the accusa
</p>
<p>tion appeared a false one, and all the other officers sympathized
</p>
<p>with Metellus, who was overwhelmed with sorrow ; while Marius
</p>
<p>with joy declared that the thing was all his own doing, and was not
</p>
<p>ashamed to acknowledge, in all companies, that he had lodged an

<p>avenging fury in the breast of Metellus, w T hich would not fail to
</p>
<p>punish him for having put to death the hereditary friend of his family.
</p>
<p>Plutarch spates, that after this they became more open enemies, and
</p>
<p>that the conversation between Metellus and Marius, of which
</p>
<p>Sallust makes mention in the 64th chapter of this narrative, took
</p>
<p>place subsequently to this event. According to the biographer, one
</p>
<p>day, when Marius was standing by, Metellus said by way of insult,
</p>
<p>k< You are thinking, then, my good friend, of leaving us, and going
</p>
<p>home to solicit the consulship : would yo a not be contented to stay,
</p>
<p>and be consul with this son of mine] " The son of Metellus, adds

<p>180 flOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page
</p>
<p>4fj[ Plutarch, was then very young. {Plut. Vit. Mar. c. 8.  ed. HuHm
</p>
<p>vol. 3, p. 68.)
</p>
<p>4. Nam is civis ex Latio erat. It was enacted by the Porciaii
</p>
<p>law, that no one should bind, scourge, or kill, a Roman citizen ; and,
</p>
<p>by the Sempronian law, that sentence should not be passed upon the
</p>
<p>life of a Roman citizen without the order of the people. It still
</p>
<p>remains a disputed point whether the operation of these laws was
</p>
<p>suspended or not in the Roman camp. The present passage of
</p>
<p>Sallust goes to prove, that the laws in question were not superseded
</p>
<p>by the military power of the consul, but remained in full force, since
</p>
<p>the words of our author fairly imply that Turpilius would not have
</p>
<p>lost his life had he been a citizen of Rome. In the days of Polybius,
</p>
<p>however, before the period of which Sallust treats, it would appear
</p>
<p>that the punishment of delinquents in the camp was not impeded by
</p>
<p>the laws mentioned above. The subject is discussed by Lipsius,
</p>
<p>(De Mil. Rom. 5. dial. 18,) though without being brought to any
</p>
<p>definite conclusion.
</p>
<p>5. Eum suspiciens. " Suspecting him." An unusual meaning
</p>
<p>for the verb suspicio, which commonly denotes, " to look upward,"
</p>
<p>" to admire," &c. It derives its peculiar force, in the present in-
</p>
<p>stance, from its opposition to suspectus, both suspectus and suspi-
</p>
<p>ciens coming from the same verb. The common form is suspectans.
</p>
<p>6. Fatigare animum. " He wearied his invention."  Popularibus
</p>
<p>suis. " To his countrymen."  Superavcrant. " Had remained
</p>
<p>undone." More literally, " had remained over." To complete the
</p>
<p>construction we may understand agendae, but this is not necessary.
</p>
<p>7. Inter hiberna. In chapter 61 we are informed, that Metellus
</p>
<p>had fixed the winter quarters of his army in that part of the Roman
</p>
<p>province which was nearest to Numidia, and that he had besides
</p>
<p>stationed garrisons in several cities of Numidia. Hence the pro-
</p>
<p>priety of the phrase inter hiberna.
</p>
<p>8. Metusque rem impediebat. These words are added in order
</p>
<p>to explain the force of per culsus, and are not therefore superfluous,

</p>
<p>this alone was the question."
</p>
<p>11. Aegrum animum. "A mind burdened with care." Ill at
</p>
<p>ease.  Negotiorum curator. " The manager of his private affairs."
</p>
<p>Some of the French editors make this office the same as that of
</p>
<p>private secretary. It is rather that of confidential agent and adviser.

</p>
<p>speaking, the singular is here the proper form on account of the dis-
</p>
<p>junctive aut. which precedes. Similar deviations, however, some-
</p>
<p>times occur in the best writers. Thus Cicero, (Or. 2, 4, 16,) " Ne

<p>antur." So Longinus, (c. 14, ed. Weiske,) v&s av ILXdroiv j)
</p>
<p>AriiioadevTjs vxpoxrav, r} iv laropia QovKvdicrig. The aim of the

<p>different objects to the mind in such a way as that they may operate
</p>
<p>with combined force upon it, and at the same time not lose their
</p>
<p>individuality.

<p>3. Decreverat. " Had decreed this," i. e. the management of
</p>
<p>this war. Some editions have Numidiam expressed, which is equiva-
</p>
<p>lent. The determination of the consular provinces properly belonged
</p>
<p>to the senate. Sometimes, however, the people, as in the present
</p>
<p>instance, reversed what the senate had decreed respecting the pro-
</p>
<p>vinces. So the attempt of "Marius, by means of the tribune Sul-
</p>
<p>picius, to get the command of the war against Mithridates transferred
</p>
<p>from Sylla to himself by the suffrages of the people, gave occasion
</p>
<p>to the first civil war at Rome.
</p>
<p>4. Bocchum. Bocchus was king of Mauritania. Compare chap. 19.
</p>
<p>5. Varius incertusque agitabat. Understand sese. " Was dis-
</p>
<p>tracted by a variety of schemes, and uncertain which to put in ope-
</p>
<p>ration."  Neque Mi res, &c. " Neither any result, nor any plan
</p>
<p>of operations, nor any individual fully pleased him." Res is here
</p>
<p>equivalent to facta, and consilium to facienda.
</p>
<p>6. Quocumque intenderat. Understand animum. " Whitherso-
</p>
<p>ever he directed his thoughts."
</p>
<p>7. Pro tempore. "As well as the occasion would admit."
</p>
<p>Ejus milites. These words have very much the appearance of a
</p>
<p>useless gloss, though they are given in all the manuscripts.
</p>
<p>8. Tuta sunt. For tuita sunt, from tueor. The primitive form
</p>
<p>was tuor, tuitus sum, tui. Compare Catullus, 20, 5. Stat. Achill.
</p>
<p>1, 131, ap. Prise. 8, 17. Plaut. Asin: 2, 3, 23, &c.
</p>
<p>9. Impensius modo, &c. " Now more than ever distrusting the
</p>
<p>success of his affairs."
</p>
<p>10. Filiorumque ejus, &c. " And where many things had been
</p>
<p>provided for the educating and rearing of his offspring." Filiorum
</p>
<p>appears to be here used both for sons and daughters. Compare the
</p>
<p>remark of Quintilian, (9, 3,) " Jungit autem et diversos sexus, ut

<p>cum marem feminamque jilios dicimus." So also, Cortius, (ad. loc.)
</p>
<p>" Filiorum credo etiam adfilias Jugurthae spectat. A potiore enim
</p>
<p>sexu denominationem sumunt, et filios, fratres, soceros, patres, avos,
</p>
<p>reges, dicunt, qui sunt ex utroque sexu."
</p>
<p>11. Flumenque proxumum. Referring to the last river that would
</p>
<p>be met with before coming to Thala.  Patrandi. In the sense of
</p>
<p>conficiendi, " bring to a close."  Naturam etiam. Referring to
</p>
<p>the difficulties presented by the arid country which intervened.
</p>
<p>KQ 1. Vasa. In the singular vas, vasis, in the plural vasa, vasorum-

<p>The old nominative vamem occurs in Plaut. True. 1, 1, 33

</p>
<p>2. Ub% praesto forent. We have adopted the reading of all the gQ
</p>
<p>old editions, forent, instead of fuerint, which latter is given by
</p>
<p>Cortius and others. The sense requires for ent, "where they should
</p>
<p>be ready."
</p>
<p>3. Ea modo. " It alone."  Officio, intenderant. " Had overdone
</p>
<p>tneir duty," i. e. had exceeded their instructions. Intendere has
</p>
<p>here the force of " augere" " in magnitudinem extendcre." Com-
</p>
<p>pare Suetonius, {Tib. 62,) " Auxit intenditque saevitiam."
</p>
<p>4. Religione. " From a religious feeling." They ascribed the
</p>
<p>rain to the manifest interposition of the gods.  Animis eorum.
</p>
<p>" To their courage." The more usual form would be the singular
</p>
<p>animo.
</p>
<p>5. Locorum asperitate. " By the difficulties which the country
</p>
<p>presented."
</p>
<p>6. Infectum. " Impracticable."  Arma, tela. These terms must
</p>
<p>be translated generally, " calculated for defence, for offence." 
</p>
<p>Ceteris imperitantem. " Giving laws to the rest of men." Imperito
</p>
<p>denotes the frequent exercise of unlimited authority, and is well
</p>
<p>calculated to express the superiority of nature over the efforts of
</p>
<p>man.  Industna. " By persevering efforts."
</p>
<p>7. Per otium, &c. " In time of leisure, and in consequence of
</p>
<p>opportunity."
</p>
<p>8. Praelio intentos. " Determined to defend themselves."
</p>
<p>Equivalent to " ad strenue pugnandum paratos"
</p>
<p>9. Ex copia. " Out of the whole number," which the situation
</p>
<p>of the place afforded. Sallust does not mean, out of a large num-
</p>
<p>ber, but out of as many as the place presented for selection.
</p>
<p>10. Et super aggerem, &c. We have given the reading of
</p>
<p>Cortius. The Bipont edition has, insuper aggere, turribus, opus
</p>
<p>et administros tutari.
</p>
<p>11. Multo ante labor e, &c. In construing, we must render ante
</p>
<p>as if it were an adjective qualifying labor e and praeliis. "At

</p>
<p>fact, to antequam urbem ceperint.
</p>
<p>12. Post dies quadraginta, quam, &c. Equivalent to die quad-
</p>
<p>ragesimo postquam eo ventum erat. Consult note 3, page 68. 
</p>
<p>Oppido modo potiti. " Made themselves masters of the town alone."
</p>
<p> Corrupta. " Was destroyed."
</p>
<p>1. Arietibus. The most formidable machine made use of by the pr 
</p>
<p>Romans for the taking of cities was the aries, or " battering ram ;"
</p>
<p>a long beam, like the mast of a ship, and armed at one end with iron
</p>
<p>in the form of a ram's head ; whence it had its name. It was aus-

</p>
<p>lay across two posts, and, hanging thus equally balanced, it was by
</p>
<p>a hundred men, more or less, (who were frequently changed,)
</p>
<p>violently thrust forward, drawn back, again pushed forward, till by
</p>
<p>repeated strokes it had shaken and broken down the wall with its
</p>
<p>iron head. The ram was covered with sheds or mantlets, called
</p>
<p>vineae, which have already been described.
</p>
<p>2. Adflictas. " Completely ruined." Literally, " dashed to the
</p>
<p>ground."  Prima. " Most valuable." Compare Catiline, chapter
</p>
<p>36.  Eas ipsi volentes pependere. " This (punishment) they suf-
</p>
<p>fered voluntarily from their own hands." Literally, '-' these (atone -
</p>
<p>ments) they of themselves voluntarily paid." They had nothing to
</p>
<p>expect from the Roman commander, in case they fell into his hands,
</p>
<p>but the cruelest punishment.
</p>
<p>3. Pariter cum capta Thala. The same as Eodem tempore quo
</p>
<p>Thala capta fuit.  Praefectumque. "And governor."  Ni id
</p>
<p>festinaret. "That unless he should hasten to do this," i. e. to
</p>
<p>afford them aid.
</p>
<p>4. Suam salutem, &c. Elorum in this passage refers to the
</p>
<p>Romans, and it is the same as if Sallust had said, suam, qui
</p>
<p>illorum socii essent, salutem. The passage may hence be para-
</p>
<p>phrased as follows : " they, the allies of the Romans, would be
</p>
<p>involved in the greatest danger." Or, we may render more literally,
</p>
<p>though less in accordance with the English idiom, " their safety,
</p>
<p>who were the allies of the Romans, would be in the greatest danger."
</p>
<p>5. Navi fecerant. "They had executed with promptness." The
</p>
<p>more usual form, and, we may add, the earlier one, would seem to
</p>
<p>have been gnavus, not navus. The term appears to be derived
</p>
<p>from, or analogous to, the Greek yewaXog, by contraction yvaTos, and
</p>
<p>with the insertion of the digamma, dropping at the same time the i
</p>
<p>we have yvaFog, in Latin gnavus.

<p>6. Situm inter duas Syrtis. Of course, Leptis Magna is meant.

</p>
<p>Consult Geographical Index, under the article Syrtes.

<p>7. Extrema Africa. The extremity of Africa towards the east
</p>
<p>is here meant, according to the ancient division of it, by which
</p>
<p>Egypt was excluded from it and made part of Asia.  Proxuma.
</p>
<p>Understand loca.
</p>
<p>8. Uti fors tulit. "As chance has brought it about."  Alta;
</p>
<p>alia in tempestate vadosa. " Are at one time deep, at another shal-
</p>
<p>low." Some very erroneously explain this as if alia agreed with loca
</p>
<p>understood, and in tempestate meant " during tempestuous weather. "

<p>y. Leges, cultusque, &c. " Their laws and the principal features g|

<p>in their mode of life were Sidonian." Cultus is here the genitive
</p>
<p>depending upon pleraque the plural neuter.
</p>
<p>10. Frequen.tem Numidiam. " The thickly-settled part of Nu-
</p>
<p>inidia."  Multi vastique loci. " A large tract of desert country."
</p>
<p>11. Indignum. " Unsuitable."  Facinus. "Achievement,"
</p>
<p>1. Pleraeque Africae. Compare chapter 54. " Plerumque ex- 52
</p>
<p>crcitum" and consult note 2, page 38.  Ager in medio arenosus,
</p>
<p>&c. " A sandy region intervened, of one uniform appearance," i. e.
</p>
<p>a naked, open plain."
</p>
<p>2. Legiones. " Armies." Sallust here speaks " more Romano,' 11
</p>
<p>and applies to other nations terms which can only suit his own.
</p>
<p>3. Per inducias. " During a truce."  Legati. " Deputies."
</p>
<p>4. Quibus nomen Philaenis erat. " Whose name was Philaeni."
</p>
<p>An elegant construction, the dative Philaenis being attracted, as
</p>
<p>the grammarians term it, to the dative of the person. The plain
</p>
<p>syntax would be, quibus nomen Philaeni (or Philaenorum) erat.
</p>
<p>Compare Livy, (3, 17,) " Consules leges decemvir ales, quibus

<p>tabulis duodecim est nomen, in aes incisas in publico proposuerunt."
</p>
<p>5. Nuda gignenhum. " Bare of vegetation." Compare chapter

</p>
<p>fending on morari.

<p>7. Ob rem corruptam. " For their mismanagement."  Criminart.
</p>
<p>" Alleged." The primitive meaning of crimen is a charge, or accu-

<p>null and void.

</p>
<p>5*-J 4. Opportunissumam. " Most advantageous." Promising to to
</p>
<p>productive of the most important aid.
</p>
<p>5. Bocchi. Many of the old editions read Boccho, in the dative
</p>
<p>making Bocchus to have been Jugurtha's son-in-law. The Abbfc
</p>
<p>Brotier, relying upon this reading and some of Sylla's medals, pro-
</p>
<p>poses to substitute, in Plutarch's life of Marius, where mention is
</p>
<p>made of the Moorish king, the term son-in-law (yapfipos), for father-
</p>
<p>in-law (irsudsp6s). But M. Vauvilliers more judiciously contends,,
</p>
<p>from six manuscripts of Sallust, and in conformity with Floras (3,
</p>
<p>1) for the term father-in-law. In this Larcher concurs. Cortius,
</p>
<p>the Bipont editor, Burnouf, Planche, Kunhardt, &c. read Bocchi.
</p>
<p>6. Ea necessitudo. " This connexion."  Denas. " Ten a piece."
</p>
<p>7. Animus multitudine distrahitur. " Affection is weakened by
</p>
<p>the large number that have claims upon the heart." Literally,
</p>
<p>" the heart is distracted amid a large number."  Nulla pro socia
</p>
<p>obtinet. " No one of them enjoys the rank of consort."
</p>
<p>8. Profunda avaritia. " Of insatiable cupidity." A metaphor
</p>
<p>borrowed from a deep engulfing whirlpool. Compare Livy (29,
</p>
<p>17,) " Si avaritiam solus ipse exercere satis haberet, unam pro-
</p>
<p>iundam quidem voraginem tamen patientia nostra expleremus."
</p>
<p>9. Quis omnia regna, &c. " That all monarchies were to them
</p>
<p>objects of hostile regard." Quis for quibus, and, as it begins a
</p>
<p>clause, to be rendered by illis.
</p>
<p>10. Turn sese, &c. " That, at present, he himself was ; that, a
</p>
<p>short time previous, the Carthaginians, and also king Perses, had
</p>
<p>been ; that, for the time to come, as each one appeared very power-
</p>
<p>ful, so he would be regarded as, an enemy by the Romans." Perses
</p>
<p>had been king of Macedonia, and was vanquished and led in triumph
</p>
<p>by Paulus Aemilius.

<p>Alienam rem. " The interests of another." Referring to Marius,
</p>
<p>the new consul.

<p>5. Magnam copiam. " A great opportunity."
</p>
<p>6. Omne helium, &c. " That every war was easy to be under-
</p>
<p>taken, but ended with the greatest difficulty." Sumi is here used
</p>
<p>in the sense of incipi.  Deponi cum victores velint. Compare Cati

<p>same offer were extended to Jugurtha.

<p>Bocchus.  Bellum intactum trahi. " The w T ar was protracted,

<p>without any thing of importance being done."
</p>
<p>10. Cupientissuma plche. " In full accordance with the wishes
</p>
<p>of the populace." Literally, "by the very eagerly desiring com-
</p>
<p>mons."  Jussit. The accusative provinciam is generally thought
</p>
<p>to be dependant here on jussit. The simpler construction, however,
</p>
<p>would be jussit Numidiam esse provinciam ei.
</p>
<p>11. Multus atque ferox instare. " Was frequent and violent in
</p>
<p>his attacks on that order." The adjectives multus and ferox are
</p>
<p>here elegantly employed instead of the adverbs multum and
</p>
<p>ferociter.
</p>
<p>12. Sese consuhtum, &c. Compare the account given by
</p>
<p>Plutarch : "He (Marius) scrupled not to say, that he had taken the
</p>
<p>consulship, as so much booty, from the effeminacy of the high born

</p>
<p>with him." Veterans, who were exempt from any farther military
</p>
<p>duty, were sometimes induced to serve again by special request
</p>
<p>from a commander. If they did so, they were freed from all the
</p>
<p>drudgery of the camp, such as going for water, wood, forage, stand-
</p>
<p>ing guard, &c. and were generally marshalled by themselves under
</p>
<p>a standard of their own. The military age with the Romans began
</p>
<p>at seventeen, and ended generally with the forty-fifth year, after
</p>
<p>which period they were exempt, and only served if they pleased, as
</p>
<p>has just been stated. They were then called emeriti stipendiis t
</p>
<p>and, from their being invited to serve a second time, evocati.
</p>
<p>3. Ceterum etiam. " Nay they even."  Quia neque plebi, &c.

<p>We have here an imitation of the Greek construction alluded to in

</p>
<p>agreeable to the common people, and Marius to be likely to lose the

<p>of the signal favour you have conferred upon me." More literally,
</p>
<p>" how heavy a task, &c. together with your very great act of kind-

<p>10. Opinione, Quirites, asperius est. "Is more difficult, Ro-
</p>
<p>mans, than is generally supposed."
</p>
<p>11. Ad hoc. From this to the end of the sentence, nam aha
</p>
<p>irfirma sunt, Marius seeks to show, how absolutely necessary it is
</p>
<p>for him to be possessed of integrity and principle, since he wants
</p>
<p>all those adventitious aids on which the nobility rely for impunity
</p>
<p>in their guilty career.  Nam alia infirma sunt. " For my other
</p>
<p>supports are weak."
</p>
<p>12. Et illud intellego. A new argument is here advanced, to
</p>
<p>show why he must labour strenuously and faithfully in his new
</p>
<p>office. In order, namely, that he may fulfil the hopes of the good,
</p>
<p>and disappoint the expectations of the bad.
</p>
<p>13. Aequos bonosque. " That the just and the upright." These
</p>
<p>are flattering epithets purposely applied to the commons.  Quippe
</p>
<p>benefacta, &c. " Since the correct discharge of duty, on my part,
</p>
<p>proves of service to my country."
</p>
<p>14. Invadendi. " Of attack." Some understand me, it is better,
</p>
<p>however, to take the verb here absolutely, without any special
</p>
<p>reference to a case. The nobility may be considered, according to
</p>
<p>the idea of Marius, as watching for an opportunity of attacking both
</p>
<p>the commons and himself.
</p>
<p>15. Ut neque vos capiamini, &c. "That you may not be
</p>
<p>ensnared, and that they may be disappointed." A thing est frustra,
</p>
<p>when it is attended with no advantage ; a person est frustra when
</p>
<p>disappointed in his hopes.
</p>
<p>1. Itafui. " I have so lived." Fui is here used in an uncom- ;r/
</p>
<p>mon sense for aetatem egi.  Consueta. " Familiar to me."
</p>
<p>2. Ante vestra benefxia. " Before I received any favours at
</p>
<p>your hands."  Accepta mercede. Alluding to the consulship. 
</p>
<p>Deseram. " To discontinue." Or, perhaps, the verb is susceptible
</p>
<p>of a still stronger meaning : u Basely to abandon."

</p>
<p>ship, though posterior, in point of time, to the being elected consul,
</p>
<p>is in reality prior to it, as regards the truth itself and the advantages

<p>resulting to the state." The idea intended to be conveyed is this :
</p>
<p>In strictness of language, no one can be said to hold a station, the
</p>
<p>consulship, for example, until he is appointed to it by the suffrages
</p>
<p>of the people. And yet, if we take into consideration the faithful
</p>
<p>discharge of official duties, and the advantages thence resulting to
</p>
<p>the state, we must admit that qualifications and experience are prior
</p>
<p>in the scale of importance to the mere formal appointment to office
</p>
<p>In a word, they alone are true consuls, who are qualified to dis-
</p>
<p>charge correctly the duties of the consulship, when they present
</p>
<p>themselves before the people as candidates for that high station ;

<p>head, and hence called hasia pura. The vexillum was a streamer
</p>
<p>on the end of a lance or spear, of different colours, with or without

<p>Greek, nor would ever make use of that language upon any serious
</p>
<p>occasion : thinking it ridiculous to bestow time on lefirning a

<p>language of which the teachers were slaves. And when, after his
</p>
<p>second triumph, at the dedication of a temple, he exhibited shows
</p>
<p>to the people in the Grecian manner, he barely entered the theatre
</p>
<p>and sat down, and then immediately departed." Plutarch justly

<p>he excesses which stained the character of Marius.

</p>
<p>^^ 15 Praesidia agitare. "To guard." Compare the remark of
</p>
<p>Cortius : " Pratsidium agitare nihil aliud est quam praes?dio esse,
</p>
<p>vel frumentantibus, vel impedimentis, vel urbi oppugnatae."
</p>
<p>gg 1. Neque illos arte colam, &c. " Nor will I treat them with
</p>
<p>severity of discipline, myself with indulgence. "
</p>
<p>2. Hoc est utile, &c. " This is an exercise of authority produc-
</p>
<p>tive of benefit to the state ; this, such as one citizen should put in
</p>
<p>practice towards another." In explanation of the peculiar meaning
</p>
<p>of civile in this passage, compare Livy 6. 40 ":  " Sermo est minime
</p>
<p>civilis ;" and Crevier's note :-  " Sermo est qui minime deceat cives
</p>
<p>memores se cum civibus agere, qui pari jure libertatis fruuntur, in
</p>
<p>quos minime liceat imperioso genere sermonis uti."
</p>
<p>3. Tute. The pronoun. " When you yourself live in luxurious
</p>
<p>indulgence, to compel your army to the performance of their duty
</p>
<p>by severity of punishment, this is to be a tyrant, not a commander "
</p>
<p>With esse understand te, so that dominwa and imperatorem may be
</p>
<p>accusatives after the verb.
</p>
<p>4. Quia parum scite, &c. " Because I furnish out an entertain-
</p>
<p>ment with little elegance, and keep no buffoon nor cook of higher
</p>
<p>price than my steward : charges which I am perfectly willing to ad-
</p>
<p>mit." The term histrio, which here denotes a buffoon kept for the
</p>
<p>amusement of the company, is a general appellation, among other
</p>
<p>Roman writers, for an actor. Livy makes the word of Etrurian
</p>
<p>origin : " Quia hister Tusco verbo ludio vocabatur, nomen histrioni-
</p>
<p>bus inditum." (Liv. 7. 2.) Festus is undoubtedly wrong in sup
</p>
<p>posing that they were so called because they came originally from
</p>
<p>Histria :  " Histricnes dicti quodprimum ex Histria venerint" In
</p>
<p>relation to the inroads of luxury among the Romans, compare Livy,
</p>

<p>three commanders are designated. Avaritia refers to Bestia, impe-

</p>
<p>5. Ex classibus. By the institution of Servius Tullius, the Ro-
</p>
<p>man people were divided into six classes, according to the valuation
</p>
<p>of their property. The richest were placed in the first class, from
</p>
<p>which there was a regular progression, as respected wealth and dig-
</p>
<p>nity, down to the lowest or sixth class. The members of this class
</p>
<p>formed the great bulk of poorer citizens, and were denominated
</p>
<p>capite censi, from having no fortune, but being " rated by the
</p>
<p>head." At first, none of the lowest class were enlisted as soldiers,
</p>
<p>except in dangerous emergencies. The alteration introduced by
</p>
<p>Marius may be regarded as one of the chief causes of the rain of
</p>
<p>the republic.

<p>he mentions second in order, as born of the Nile, and surnamed

<p>go tne remarks of Cortius, (ad loc.) and Perizonms, (ad Sanctii Min.
</p>
<p>1, 15). Still, however, the whole clause is very suspicious. If
</p>
<p>coercitum be taken as the simple participle of the passive voice,
</p>
<p>with the preteritive meaning (" kept in subjection,") it may well be
</p>
<p>asked, when had the inhabitants of the place proved faithless to the
</p>
<p>Romans 1 If, on the other hand, coercitum be taken for coercendum,
</p>
<p>the Capsensians are punished on anticipation merely ! For the
</p>
<p>Romans as yet know nothing about them. The only way to obviate
</p>
<p>the difficulty, is by supposing that the allusion in genus hominum,
</p>
<p>&c, is to the race of Numidians generally.

</p>
<p>consulta in virtutem trahebantur. Our lection, however, appears
</p>
<p>decidedly preferable, if we only take virtutem in its more extended

<p>great accomplishments and respectability, he still continued his

</p>
<p>have been too strong.

<p>7. Non acie. " Not in regular array." Equivalent to non tur-

<p>the reading of some editions.

<p>10. Novique, et ob ea, &c. "And the new levies along with
</p>
<p>them, rendered even in this way more familiar with warfare." If
</p>
<p>the text be correct, Sallust means to convey the idea, that the new
</p>
<p>levies, being accustomed to be united with the veterans, (chap. 87,)
</p>
<p>had learned the art of war by practice and example, and displayed then-
</p>
<p>military experience very effectually on the present occasion, being
</p>
<p>encouraged by the presence and support of the older troops. Hence,
</p>
<p>ob ea will refer to their having been in the habit of being united
</p>
<p>with the veterans on previous occasions, and their being again so
</p>
<p>united in the present instance. It is extremely doubtful, however,
</p>
<p>whether Sallust wrote what we have given in the text, and what all
</p>
<p>the editions follow. Cortius retains the common reading, but sug-
</p>
<p>gests the following, partly from a manuscript lection, and partly
</p>
<p>from conjecture :  Denique Romani veteres, belli scientes, si

</p>
<p>be in their favour."  Ex copia rerum consilium trahit. " Forms a

</p>
<p>3. Pauco munimento, &c. The singular of paucus is of rare
</p>
<p>occurrence. We meet with it in Horace, (A. P. 203,) " for amine
</p>
<p>pauco" and in Aulus Gellius, (20, 1,) " injurias pauco aere diluere."
</p>
<p>Cortius reads, pauca munimento quaerebat.
</p>
<p>4. Agitare. " To patrol." Better than agitare noctem, " to pass

<p>was at the rate of twenty miles in five hours, the quick step, (plenua

</p>
<p>2. Quadrato agmine. The agmen quadratum of the Romans
</p>
<p>was a right-angled parallelogram, not a square. Quadrato agmine
</p>
<p>may therefore be rendered, " with Ins army in column." Compare
</p>
<p>the words of Salmasius, (de Re Mil. Rom,, c. 10, p. 103, edit.
</p>
<p>Ludg. 1657,) " Quadratum agmen non dicitur, cujus latitudo

</p>
<p>vol. 1, p. 195,) u ha figure ressembloit a une parallelogramme
</p>

<p>3. Apud dextumos. " On the extreme right."  Praeterea cohortes
</p>
<p>Ligurum curabat. " Had charge also of the cohorts of the Ligu-

</p>
<p>here equivalent to sed tamen, and the meaning intended to be con-
</p>
<p>veyed, is : " But, whether he acted from ambitious motives, or from
</p>
<p>being himself accustomed to hardships, still one thing is certain, that

<p>11. Utique. We have adopted the conjectural emendation of
</p>
<p>Gronovius, in place of aeque as given by Cortius. The meaning
</p>
<p>of the whole clause will be, " having supposed, that, out of the whole
</p>
<p>number, some certainly, no matter who, would come in the rear of
</p>
<p>the enemy." (Compare Quarterly Journal of Education, No. 3,
</p>
<p>p. 151.) Cortius refers aeque to ah tergo, and translates it, " gerade
</p>
<p>von hinten zu" " directly in the rear." The Bipont editor explains
</p>
<p>aeque as follows : " Ex quadruplici agmine certe unum, quodcunque
</p>
<p>esset." This explanation suits, however, utique much better than

<p>in the plural, as if Bocchus cum peditibus were a double nominative.
</p>
<p>" We sometimes find," observes Scheller, " a plural verb after a
</p>
<p>single subject or person, which, however, is united to another subject
</p>
<p>by cum, since they are there regarded as two subjects or nomina-
</p>

</p>
<p>3. Ad pedites. It is a matter of some doubt among commen-
</p>
<p>tators, whether the infantry here meant are the Roman, or those
</p>
<p>which Voluxhad brought and with which Bocchus had attacked the

</p>
<p>Roman rear. It is more than probable that the former are alluded QQ
</p>
<p>to, especially as the words ibi Latine follow. Cortius, however,
</p>
<p>is in favour of the opposite opinion.
</p>
<p>4. Satis impigre. "With great quickness," i. e. with so much
</p>
<p>jelerity as to have escaped the observation of the Romans around.
</p>
<p>Some, however, render it " with great bravery." This is certainly
</p>
<p>inferior.
</p>
<p>5. Atrocitate rei. " With the dreadful nature of the thing."
</p>
<p>The meaning intended to be conveyed is this : The Romans were
</p>
<p>thrown into alarm, not so much from any confidence which they
</p>
<p>placed in the words of Jugurtha, as from the reflection, that there
</p>
<p>was indeed a possibility of their favourite commander's losing his
</p>
<p>life in the action.
</p>
<p>6. Adeptam. Used passively, adipiscor being a common, not a
</p>
<p>deponent, verb.  Vitabundus. "After making the most vigorous
</p>
<p>exertions to escape." Or, it may be rendered generally, " by a
</p>
<p>desperate effort." Consult note 10, page 61.
</p>
<p>7. Sequi, &c. A beautiful specimen of the figure Asyndeton,
</p>
<p>in imitation, very probably, of the celebrated passage in Xenophon,

<p>8. Niti modo. Supply surgere. " They merely made an effort

<p>to rise."  Qua visus erat. "As far as the eye could reach."
</p>
<p>Visus is a noun of the fourth declension; and the clause, rendered
</p>
<p>literally, is, " where there was a view."
</p>
<p>9. Postea loci. For the simple pes tea.
</p>
<p>10. Post diem quintum, quam, &c. " On the fifth day after the
</p>
<p>barbarians had met with their second defeat." The Latin language
</p>
<p>admits several variations of this construction. Thus we may either
</p>
<p>adopt the form used in the text, or quinto die postquam pugnaverant,
</p>
<p>or quinque diebus postquam pugnaverant, or post dies quintos quam
</p>
<p>pugnaverant ; or with the ablative alone, omitting post, die quinto

<p>assertion would seem to have been, to ingratiate himself with the

<p>206 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>Y2 h ere m efficicbant, that is, the verb has two meanings, to suit
</p>
<p>our idiom, one for each clause. " Caused the number to appear
</p>
<p>greater than the reality to Sylla and the rest of his party, and gave
</p>
<p>rise to apprehensions as of the approach of an enemy. "
</p>
<p>7. Expedire. " Got ready for battle." We may understand ai
</p>
<p>pugnam, which is expressed in Livy, (38, 21,) " Quos ubi Romani
</p>
<p>viderunt, expediunt sese ad pugnam."
</p>
<p>8. Tentare. "Each tried."  Intendere. This is commonly
</p>
<p>rendered, " they bent their bows," with an ellipsis of arcus. Such
</p>
<p>an interpretation, however, is decidedly pleonastic, since arma atque
</p>
<p>tela tentare precedes. The true meaning is, " directed his whole
</p>
<p>attention to the approaching engagement." Understand animum.
</p>
<p>9. Rem, uti erat, &c. " Bring back word, as was actually the
</p>
<p>case, that all was peaceful," i. e. that there was nothing to fear.
</p>
<p>10. Obviam Mis simul, et praesidio. " Both to receive them,
</p>
<p>and to act as an escort." Literally, " both to meet them, and for a
</p>
<p>guard."
</p>
<p>11. Incerto voltu. " With a troubled look."
</p>
<p>12. Animo ferocL " With stem resolution."  Certa pestis
</p>
<p>" Certain destruction."  Ab eodem. Referring to Volux.
</p>
<p>13. Coenatos esse. " To have their evening repast over." Some
</p>
<p>neuter verbs have participles which are passive in form, but active
</p>
<p>in meaning ; as coenatus, " one who has supped ;" pransus, " one
</p>
<p>who has dined ;" juratus, " one who has sworn," &c. The Roman
</p>
<p>soldiers took food twice a day, at dinner and at supper. The former
</p>
<p>was a slight meal, which they commonly took standing. They
</p>
<p>indulged themselves a little more at supper.
</p>
<p>14. Prima vigilia. The Romans, as has been observed in a
</p>
<p>previous note, divided the night into four watches of three hours
</p>
<p>each. The first watch commenced at sunset.
</p>
<p>>yQ 1. Ante. " In advance of them."

<p>4. Nudum et caecum corpus. " That part of the body which has

<p>no shield to protect it, and no eyes by which danger may be

</p>
<p>6. Ceterum, <fcc. " Besides, since he (Jugurtha) had not a large *7Q
</p>
<p>force with him, and his hopes and resources depended upon his
</p>
<p>(Volux's) father, that he (Jugurtha) would not dare to do any thing
</p>
<p>openly, while he himself, (Volux,) the son, was present as a witness
</p>
<p>Df his conduct."
</p>
<p>7. Per media ejus castra. Cortius thinks the meaning would be
</p>
<p>improved if media were omitted, and prae rendered by praeter. We
</p>
<p>cannot agree with him. Volux had stated, that Jugurtha would not
</p>
<p>dare to do any thing openly if he were present : in confirmation of
</p>
<p>this, he proposes that they march boldly through his very encamp-
</p>
<p>ment. Jugurtha probably had encamped his forces in two divisions,
</p>
<p>or else in scattered order.
</p>
<p>8. Acciderant. Some editions have accesserant. Cortius, how-
</p>
<p>ever, successfully defends the lection we have given in the text, and
</p>
<p>makes it signify " they had come ;" for accido frequently has this
</p>
<p>meaning when any person or thing chances to arrive unexpectedly.
</p>
<p>Compare Livy, (32, 30,) " Civitati fama incerta accidit ;" and
</p>
<p>Quintus Curtius, (4, 4, 6,) " Alexander classemlitori, e quo fremitus
</p>
<p>acciderat, admovit." So also Tacitus, {Hist. 4, 29, 4,) Unde
</p>
<p>clamor acciderat ;" and our own author, chapter 88 of this narrative, .
</p>
<p>" quo improvisus gramor accideret."
</p>
<p>9. Orator. "As his ambassador," or "agent." Compare
</p>
<p>Livy, (30, 16,) "Jam nullo auctore belli ultra audito, oratores ad
</p>
<p>pacem petendam mittunt." Observe also the change of construc-
</p>
<p>tion in our author, " praemissus orator ', et (praemissus) specu-
</p>
<p>latum."
</p>
<p>10. Quern Bocchus, &c. Cortius inserts Romanis after fidum ,
</p>
<p>but Bocchus had not been long acquainted with the Romans, and,
</p>
<p>therefore, fidum Roma?iis seems too harsh. Fidum here means
</p>
<p>simply, "worthy of reliance."
</p>
<p>11. Consulta sese omnia, &c. "That he was keeping every
</p>
<p>subject of consultation undetermined, until he could consider it

</p>
<p>in conjunction with him," i. e. that he had reserved every thing for
</p>
<p>their common consideration.
</p>
<p>1. Neu Jugurthae legatum pertimesceret, &c. The true read- 74
</p>
<p>ing here is extremely doubtful. Some have accitum esse quo res,
</p>
<p>&c. Others cautum esse. Cortius places a semicolon after perti-
</p>
<p>mesceret, and makes quo res communis, &c, follow immediately
</p>
<p>after, without either accitum esse or cautum esse. As accitum esse
</p>
<p>is wanting in most of the manuscripts, we have adopted the conjec-
</p>
<p>ture of Gronovius, by which quo is changed into quin, and the
</p>
<p>meaning of the passage then becomes, " Nor should he be disquieted
</p>
<p>at the presence of Jugurtha's ambassador, lest, in consequence of
</p>
<p>208 NOTES TO THE

<p>Page.
</p>
<p>y this, their common business might be carried on with less freedom
</p>
<p>than otherwise. "
</p>
<p>2. Nam ab insidiis ejus, &c. Bocchus means, that he has been
</p>
<p>compelled to allow Jugurtha to have an ambassador at his court,
</p>
<p>since otherwise that monarch would have been constantly annoying
</p>
<p>him by his intrigues ; whereas the presence of his ambassador
</p>
<p>would lead Jugurtha to think, that no scheme could be formed by
</p>
<p>Bocchus, unfriendly to his (Jugurtha's) interests, without that am-
</p>
<p>bassador's perceiving it, and hence the suspicions of the Numi&an
</p>
<p>monarch would not be so constantly excited.
</p>
<p>3. Tunica fide. " With a treacherous intent." The Roman
</p>
<p>writers used the expression Punica fides to denote bad faith, in
</p>
<p>allusion t< \ the frequent violation of compacts which were charged
</p>
<p>against tl e Carthaginians by their haughty rivals. The Carthaginians
</p>
<p>might ha ve returned the compliment without any great violation of
</p>
<p>the truth. Attica fides was a proverbial expression, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, to indicate good faith. Compare Velleius Paterculus,
</p>
<p>(2, 23, 4,) " Adeo enim certa Atheniensium in Romanos fides fuit,
</p>
<p>ut semper, et in omni re, quidquid sincerafide gereretur, id Romam
</p>
<p>Attica fieri praedicarent." Some writers extend this character for
</p>
<p>good faith to the whole nation, and make Graeca fides and Attica
</p>
<p>fides synonymous. This is altogether incorrect. The true expla-
</p>
<p>nation is given by Junius, (Adagia Veterum, ^. 577,) " Graeca
</p>
<p>fides pro dubia et vana accipitur, haud pro certa : quippe quae nulla
</p>
<p>prorsus esset, nisi praesente pecunia oculitus creditori satisdaretur.

<p>7. In sua castra. The reference here is to Sylla and Bocchus,
</p>
<p>not to Sylla and Aspar as Cortius maintains. " Sulla" observes

<p>Burnouf, " quamvis paucos milites haberet, eos videlicet alicuh
</p>
<p>habere necesse fuit. Ubi autem si non in castris 1 Et Bocchus,
</p>
<p>quum bellum gereret, cur non et ipse castra in proprio regno ha-

</p>
<p>the very next day was still at the court of Bocchus, which could not

</p>
<p>possibly have been the case if he had set out the day previous for ^A
</p>
<p>the camp of Jugurtha, since it took many days subsequently for him
</p>
<p>to go and come: "pr operate itinere, post diem octavum redit ad

<p>Thus, besides the example in the text, we have in Livy, egredi urbem,

</p>
<p>term for the gestures of the body, including also the expression ot
</p>
<p>the countenance, in short, any thing indicative of the will (vultus a
</p>
<p>volo). Compare chapter 34, terrebat eum clamore, voltu, &c, where

<p>the same usage occurs.

<p>and obscure condition now rose to general esteem, suffered his am-

<p>bition to carry him so far as to order a signet to be engraved with a
</p>
<p>representation of the capture of Jugurtha. This he constantly used

<p>in sealing his letters. The device was, Bocchus delivering uti

<p>Jugurtha, and Sylla receiving him.

<p>10. G alios. More correctly Germanos, for they were the Cim

<p>bri, Teutones, and Tigurini. Compare Florus, (3, 3,) " Cimbri,

</p>
<p>eorum inundasset Oceanus, novas sedes toto orbe quaerebant ; exclu-

</p>
<p>12. Cum Gallis, &c. Compare Cicero, (Off. 1, 12,) " Cum
</p>
<p>Cimbris, ut cum inimicis, gerebatur; uter esset, non uter imperaret."
</p>
<p>13. Jugurtham vinctum, &c. It may not be improper to add a
</p>
<p>few words relative to the fate of Jugurtha. " It is said," observes
</p>
<p>Plutarch, " that when he was led before the car of the conqueror,
</p>
<p>he lost his senses. After the triumph, he was thrown into prison,
</p>
<p>where, while they were in haste to strip him, some tore his robe off
</p>
<p>his back, and others, catching eagerly at his pendants, pulled off
</p>
<p>the tips of his ears along with them. When he was thrust down
</p>
<p>naked into the dungeon, all confused, he said with a frantic smile,
</p>
<p>" Heavens ! how cold is this bath of yours !" There, having strug-
</p>
<p>gled, for six days, with extreme hunger, and to the last hour labour-
</p>
<p>ing for the preservation of life, he came to such an end as his crimes
</p>
<p>deserved. There were carried (we are told) in his triumph, three
</p>
<p>thousand and seven pounds of gold, five thousand, seven hundred
</p>
<p>and seventy-five of silver bullion, and of silver coin, seventeen thou
</p>
<p>sand and twenty-eight drachmas."
</p>
<p>14. Absens. " Though absent." This was a violation of the law,
</p>
<p>since no person, strictly speaking, was allowed to stand candidate
</p>
<p>for the consulship, unless present at the time in Rome. The con-
</p>
<p>dition, however, was often violated.
</p>
<p>15. Kalendis Januariis. The first of January, the day when
</p>
<p>tr.e new consuls were inducted into office. Consult note 13,
</p>
<p>page 105. After the solemmty of the triumph was finished, Marius,
</p>
<p>as Plutarch informs us, assembled the senate in the capitol, where,
</p>
<p>either through inadvertence, or gross msolence, he entered in his
</p>
<p>triumphal robes ; but soon perceiving that the senate was offended,
</p>
<p>he went and put on his ordinary habit, and then returned to his

<p>NOTES
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE.
</p>
<p>Page
</p>
<p>1. Omnis. For omnes. The old form. (Jugurtha, note 9, "JJ)
</p>
<p>page 1,).  Sese student praestare. The insertion of the pronoun
</p>
<p>here is not a pleonasm, as some maintain, but in reality the older
</p>
<p>and fuller form of expression, and may be regarded as equivalent to
</p>
<p>ut ipsi praestent. Instances occur in other writers also. Thus,
</p>
<p>Cicero, (Off. 2. 20.) " Gratum se videri studct." So also after
</p>
<p>cupere, velle, and malle.
</p>
<p>2. Silentio. " In obscurity." The silence which the rest of man-
</p>
<p>kind preserve respecting us, when we have done nothing to render
</p>
<p>our names illustrious.
</p>
<p>3. Prona. " Stooping downward to the earth." Compare Ovid
</p>
<p>Met. 1, 84,) " Pranaque quum spectent animaliacaeteraterram."
</p>
<p>4. Animi imperio, &c. " We use more the empire of the mind, the
</p>
<p>obedience of the body." Sallust wishes to convey the idea, that it
</p>
<p>is the province of the mind to command, of the body to obey. Some
</p>
<p>very erroneously make imperio depend for its government on the
</p>
<p>comparative magis. " We make more use of the empire of the
</p>
<p>mind, than of the obedience of the body."
</p>
<p>5. Quo. " On which account."  Rectius. " More consistent
</p>
<p>with reason."  Opibus. " By the resources."
</p>
<p>6. Memoriam nostri. " The remembrance of oursekes." Me-
</p>
<p>moriam nostram would mean " our faculty of memory."
</p>
<p>7. Habetur. The force of this verb, in the present passage, js
</p>
<p>6est seen by a paraphrase : " The endowments of mind form the
</p>
<p>only illustrious and lasting. possession."
</p>
<p>8. Sed. Elegantly used in the sense of continuation, like Se'
</p>
<p>in Greek, and to be rendered " Now."  Vine corporis, &c.
</p>
<p>" Whether a warlike enterprise depended more for its success on
</p>
<p>strength of body, or energy of mind." Literally, " whether a war-
</p>
<p>like operation proceeded more from strength of body," &c.
</p>
<p>9. Consulto. " Of deliberation."  Mature facto. " Of speedy

</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>79 f 0,010 are ^ ere e l e g am % used in place of nouns. The literal trans-
</p>
<p>lation would be, " of a thing's being deliberated upon," and " of its
</p>
<p>being performed in proper season."
</p>
<p>10. Imperii. " Of authority."  Diversi. "Differing in their views."
</p>
<p> Agitabatur. The frequentative for the simple verb, as in Jugurtha.
</p>
<p>11. Cyrus. The elder of the name.
</p>
<p>12. Lubidinem dominandi. " A lust of dominion."  Maxumam
</p>
<p>gloriam. Understand sitam esse, or something equivalent.
</p>
<p>13. Periculo atque negotiis. "From actual experience, and
</p>
<p>from affairs themselves," i. e. from the experience which affairs
</p>
<p>themselves bestowed.
</p>
<p>g0 1. Quod si regum, &c. "But if the mental qualities of kings
</p>
<p>and of those who command were exercised to the same degree in
</p>
<p>peace that they are in war."  Aequabilius atque constantius, &c.
</p>
<p>" Human affairs would proceed with more regularity and steadi-
</p>
<p>ness." This usage of the verb Tidbeo with the pronoun is analo-
</p>
<p>gous to the Greek idiom : sv %x u " ne * s well," * e - & *X l ( (  avT  v )
</p>
<p>"he has himself well." (Compare Vigefs Greek Idioms, p. 84.
</p>
<p>Seager's transl.)
</p>
<p>2. Aliud alio , &c. Alius, as has already been remarked in the
</p>
<p>Notes to the Jugurthine War, is frequently used by Sallust, and
</p>
<p>also by the best writers, with one of its own cases, or an adverb
</p>
<p>derived from it, to denote what in English requires two separate
</p>
<p>expressions. Thus we may render the passage in the text, " neither
</p>
<p>would you behold one thing carried in one direction, another in
</p>
<p>another," &c.  Artibus. "Means."
</p>
<p>3. Pro labore. " In the stead of active exertion." Labor has
</p>
<p>here a special reference to military operations.  Pro continentia et
</p>
<p>acquitate* &c. " In the stead of moderation and a regard for natu-
</p>
<p>ral equality, cupidity, and a tyrannical spirit," &c. As Sallust here
</p>
<p>contrasts virtues and vices, continentia will be opposed to lubido,
</p>
<p>and aequitas to superbia ; which removes, we conceive, all diffi-

</p>
<p>culty as to the meaning of the individual terms. Burnouf makes
</p>
<p>lubido in this passage signify " caprice," an opinion in which we
</p>
<p>cannot concur.  Fortuna. Understand principum.
</p>
<p>4. Optumum quemque. "The most deserving.'' Literally
</p>
<p>" each most deserving person."  Arant, &c. Equivalent to arando,
</p>
<p>navigando, aedificando efficiunt : hence quae homines arant, &c,
</p>
<p>may be rendered by nouns, " agriculture, navigation, architecture,''
</p>
<p> Virtuti omni parent. " Depend all upon the energies of mind foi
</p>
<p>their successful employment."
</p>
<p>5. Peregrinantes. A beautiful expression, by which the sen-
</p>
<p>sualist and the sluggard are compared to  " travellers in a foreign
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE. 21^

</p>
<p>land." Cortius, cites in explanation, a passage from Zeno of Ye- Qf%
</p>
<p>rona (Serm. 32,) " Sed qui sunt praetereuntes, nisi qui per egrinan
</p>
<p>tes corporate vitae saeculum transeunt."
</p>
<p>6. Quibus, profecto, &c. " Unto whom, certainly in opposition
</p>
<p>to the views of nature,'' &c.  Juxta. " Alike," i. e. as equally
</p>
<p>unimportant.  Quoniam de utraque siletur. " Since silence is pre-
</p>
<p>served respecting each," i. e. since they leave no memorial of their
</p>
<p>having ever existed.
</p>
<p>7. Frui anima. " To enjoy his rational nature, i. e. to answer the
</p>
<p>end of his existence.  Qui, aliquo negotio intentus, &c. " Who,
</p>
<p>in whatever employment he may be engaged, seeks for the reputa-
</p>
<p>tion attendant on some praiseworthy deed or the exercise of some
</p>
<p>useful talent."
</p>
<p>8. In magna copia rerum. " In the great variety of employ
</p>
<p>ments."  Aliud alii. Compare note 2.
</p>
<p>9. Bene dicere. Equivalent to eloquentiam exercere. Eloquence
</p>
<p>was one of the surest passports to office among the Romans.  Ab-
</p>
<p>surdum. This term was originally applied to any harsh and disa-
</p>
<p>greeable sornd, ("Vox qua' surdis auribus audiri dignaest") and
</p>
<p>subsequently to any thing devoid of merit and unworthy of notice.
</p>
<p>Haud absurdum est may therefore be rendered, " is no contemptible
</p>
<p>acquirement." ,
</p>
<p>10. Et quifecere, &c. Supply eorum before qui.
</p>
<p>11. Auctorem rerum. "The actor." Some editions have acto-
</p>
<p>rem rerum : both lections occur in manuscripts. Compare Velleius
</p>
<p>Paterculus, (2, 120, 6,) " Praeclari facinoris auctor fuit Caldvs
</p>
<p>Coelius" &c.  Res gestas. " An historical narrative."  Dictis.
</p>
<p>u By the style." Livy has an expression similar to that in the text,
</p>
<p>in which, however, dicta is used in its original meaning ; "facta
</p>
<p>dictis aequando^ (6. 20.)
</p>
<p>12. Putant. The manuscripts vary, some inserting dicta be-
</p>
<p>fore putant, others ducta, &c. We have foAowed the reading of

<p>Cortius. The ellipsis is to be supplied by reprekendisse, which is
</p>
<p>in fact expressed in one of the manuscripts. Sallust appears to have
</p>
<p>borrowed the idea in the text from Thucydides, (2, 35).
</p>
<p>13. Ubi de magna virtutc, &c. "When you make mention of
</p>
<p>the distinguished merit and glory of illustrious men," &c.
</p>
<p>14. Supra ea. u Whatever things go beyond this," or, "all
</p>
<p>btyond this."
</p>
<p>15. Studio ad rempublicam, &c. "Was led by the ardour of
</p>
<p>youth to turn my attention to public affairs," i. e. to become a can-
</p>
<p>didate for public office.  Ibique. " And in this career."  Nam pro

</p>
<p>Q0 nentia, and largitic w virtus.  Insolens n alarum arttum. M Unac-
</p>
<p>customed to evil practices."
</p>
<p>16. Rehquorum, &c. We have followed the reading of Haver-
</p>
<p>camp and Burnouf. The Bipont text has reliquis and qua cde-
</p>
<p>ros, by which eadem fama and invidia become ablatives. In
</p>
<p>our lection fama and invidia are likewise ablatives, but eadem
</p>
<p>is in the nominative agreeing with cupido. The whole passage may
</p>
<p>be rendered as follows :  " And though I was uncontaminated by the
</p>
<p>evil principles of others, nevertheless the same desire of advance-
</p>
<p>ment disquieted me, by reason of the obloquy and odium that ac-
</p>
<p>companied it, which disquieted the rest," i. e. standing forth as a
</p>
<p>candidate for public honours, I shared the fate of others : my char-
</p>
<p>acter was assailed with obloquy, and an attempt was made by my
</p>
<p>political opponents to render me an object of popular odium.  De
</p>
<p>Brosses thinks that Sallust here endeavours to offer a plausible excuse
</p>
<p>for his recent and disgraceful expulsion from the senate.
</p>
<p>82 1. Ex multis miseriisy &c. " From the many miseries and dan-
</p>
<p>gers by which it had been encompassed."
</p>
<p>2. Bonumotium. "Valuable leisure."  Servilibus qfficiis. "Mere
</p>
<p>coporeal employments." The phrase is here used in allusion to the
</p>
<p>expression in the first chapter, " animi imperio, coporis servitio ma-
</p>
<p>gis utimur." The charge therefore which some bring against Sal-
</p>
<p>lust, of his stigmatizing agriculture and hunting as employments fit
</p>
<p>only for slaves, rests on an entirely erroneous acceptation of the epi
</p>
<p>thet servilibus.
</p>
<p>3. Studio. Cortius considers studio as having reference to his-
</p>
<p>torical labours. We would rather, with Dahl, extend the term to
</p>
<p>" liberal studies" generally, so as to embrace the literature both of
</p>
<p>Greece and Rome, especially the former.
</p>
<p>4. Carptim. " In detached portions." Compare Pliny, {Ep. 8,
</p>
<p>4, 7,) " Respondebis, non posse perinde carptim, ut y contexta, per-
</p>
<p>inde inchoata placer e, ut effecta" and Tacitus, (Hist. 4, 46, extr.)

</p>
<p>The term is sometin.es used in the sense of breviter, as in Pliny,
</p>
<p>(Ep. 6, 22, 2, ) " egit autem carptim et Kara *(pa\aia" (i. e. breviter et
</p>
<p>summatim.)  Some editions of Sallust have strictim, " cursorily,"
</p>
<p>in place of carptim ; but this reading carries with it its own refuta
</p>
<p>tion. From this passage of Sallust, it appears that the history of
</p>
<p>Catiline's conspiracy was his first literary production.
</p>
<p>5. Partibus reipublicae. " The factions which agitated the re-
</p>
<p>public." Dahl is of opinion, that, from the language of the text,
</p>
<p>Sallust must have composed this narrative after his return from the
</p>
<p>government of Numidia ; since, to suppose with some commenta-
</p>

<p>8. Sed ingenio malo pravoque. " But of a wicked and depraved
</p>
<p>Bpirit." The term ingenium appears to denote quicquid est ingeni-
</p>
<p>tum, and is applied to the native qualities of the whole soul, those
</p>
<p>of the heart, as well as those of the head. ( Crombie, Gymn. vol.
</p>
<p>2, p. 73.)
</p>
<p>9. Ibique. " And in these." Ibi is here elegantly used for in
</p>
<p>iis rebus.  Juventutem. By the Romans, generally speaking,
</p>
<p>human life was divided into four stages of fifteen years each : thus
</p>
<p>puentia was within 15 : adolescentia within 30 ; juventus within
</p>
<p>45 ; and senectus comprised the remaining period of life. Compare
</p>
<p>Classical Journal, vol. 1, p. 473. Crombie' s Gymnasium, vol. 1.
</p>
<p>p. 160.
</p>
<p>10. Patiens. The verbal adjective, distinguished from the par-
</p>
<p>ticiple by its particular government ; thus, patiens inediae, " able to
</p>
<p>endure want of food," referring to a habit ; patiens inediam, " suf-
</p>
<p>fering want of food," referring to a particular point of time. So
</p>
<p>aio doctus linguam Latinam, " one who has been taught the Latin
</p>
<p>language ;" doctus linguae Latinae, " one skilled in Latin."
</p>
<p>11. Varius. " Capable of assuming any shape." Compare the
</p>
<p>picture drawn by Cicero, (pro Coel. 6,) " Ula vero in Mo nomine
</p>
<p>(sc. Catilina) mirabilia fuerunt versare suam naturam, et
</p>

<p>12. Simulator. The verb simulare, whence this noun is formed,
</p>
<p>means " to pretend to be what we are not ;" but dis simulare, " to
</p>
<p>dissemble, or conceal what we are." It is the character of hypocrisy
</p>
<p>to pretend to virtues which it has not, (simulare,) and to dissemble
</p>
<p>the vices which it has, (dis simulare.)
</p>
<p>13o Satis loquentiae. " Possessing fluency of speech enough."
</p>
<p>Several editions have eloquenf-iae, but this would be too strong here,

<p>Nam eloquentia vix uni, aut alteri ; haec vero quam Candidus

</p>
<p>habentur. " As is the case, for the most part, with human affairs."

</p>
<p>historical infinitives, that is, the infinitive is used for the imperfect.
</p>
<p>Compare Jugurtha, note 4, page 4.
</p>
<p>8. Perculsi. Other editions have percussi, which is inferior.
</p>
<p>Bentley (ad. Horat. Epod. 11, 3) correctly lays down the distinc-
</p>
<p>tion between percellere and percutere, as follows : " Vtrumque de
</p>

</p>
<p>magis quid quam percutere significat ; tanta scilicet vi percutere,
</p>
<p>ut evertas et solo prosternas. Ergo in re graviore perculsus aptius
</p>

<p>9 Imperium legitimum. " A government regulated by laws."

<p>10. Vel aetate, &c. " In the cities of all the civilized nations
</p>
<p>around the Mediterranean," observes Niebuhr, " a senate was no
</p>
<p>less essential and indispensable than a popular assembly. It was
</p>
<p>a select body of the elder citizens : such a council, says Aristotle,
</p>
<p>there always is, whether the constitution be aristocratic al or demo-
</p>

<p>11. Conservandae libertatis. " For the preservation of freedom."
</p>
<p>Some understand causa, which actually appears in a few manu-
</p>
<p>scripts and editions. Scheller, however, from a review of this and
</p>
<p>similar passages, inclines to the opinion that it will be better to

<p>supply negotium, or, when the context requires it, negotia. Thus

<p>12. Dominationemque. " And tyranny." The Romans always
</p>
<p>attached an improper meaning to the term dorninus, the root of
</p>
<p>dominatio, using it in the sense of " tyrant," " a master of slaves,"
</p>
<p>&c. On this account Augustus refused the name.
</p>
<p>13. Convertit. Understand sese. " Changed."  Annua imperia,
</p>
<p>&c. " Annual offices of magistracy, and two chief magistrates."
</p>
<p>The term imperium, in its stricter acceptation, accords better with
</p>
<p>the character of the early consulship, than with the form it assumed
</p>
<p>after the successive encroachments of the plebeian power. From
</p>
<p>the law given by Cicero, in his own plan of a well-ordered state,
</p>
<p>and which is taken with some slight alteration from one of the old

<p>2 l aws f Rome, an idea may be formed of what he considered the
</p>
<p>genuine definition of the consular power. " Regio imperio duo
</p>
<p>sunto : iique praeeundo, judicando, consulendo, praetores, judices,
</p>
<p>consules appellantor. Militiae summumjms habento, nemini parento.
</p>
<p>Ollis salus populi suprema lex esto." (Cic. de leg. 3, 3, 8, ed.
</p>
<p>Goerenz.)
</p>
<p>14. Insolescere. " Grow haughty." Compare Floru3, (1, 9,)
</p>
<p>' Ex perpetuo annuum (imperium) placuit ; ex singulari duplex,-
</p>
<p>ne potestas solitudine vel mora corrumperetur."
</p>
<p>15. Sed. The connexion between the commencement of this
</p>
<p>chapter and what precedes, is as follows : Dum reges imperium
</p>
<p>habebant, nemo se extollere audebat et laborabat. Sed postquam
</p>
<p>libertas populo restituta, quisque gloriam quaerere et ingenium
</p>
<p>prompte agendo ostendere coepit.  Ea tempestate. " At that par-
</p>
<p>ticular period." Tempestas and tempus very often differ like
</p>
<p>KaipSs and yoovoq in Greek, the former being limited to a more
</p>
<p>definite and particular period of time than the latter. <0 plv

</p>
<p>with redoubled energy, and to display more openly the abilities
</p>
<p>which he possessed." The common text has magis before extollere,
</p>
<p>which we have rejected with Cortius as savouring of a gloss. 
</p>
<p>Boni. " The talented." Mali. " Those of inferior intellects."

<p>17. Adepta libertate. Adipiscor, being a common verb, admits
</p>
<p>both this construction, as well as adepta libertatem with adepta in
</p>
<p>the nominative. It remains to be seen whether the Latin deponents
</p>
<p>be not in fact middle verbs, and whether the existence of common
</p>
<p>verbs be not a strong collateral proof of this.

</p>
<p>tarists equis. "War steeds."

<p>r acmus " Such an exploit." Facinus, as has already been remarked Q3
</p>
<p>in the Notes to the Jugurthine War, denotes " a bold or daring ac-
</p>
<p>tion," and, unless it be joined with a favourable epithet, or the
</p>
<p>action be previously described as commendable, the term is always
</p>
<p>to be understood in a vituperative sense. In the present case, the
</p>
<p>previous description of the action fixes its character. ( Vid. Crombie's
</p>
<p>Gymnasium, vol. 2, p. 159.)
</p>
<p>3. Eos divitias, &c. " These they considered riches, this an
</p>
<p>honourable fame," &c.  Divitias honestas. " Moderate wealth."
</p>
<p>The expression divitias honestas is the same as divitias bonis
</p>
<p>artibus partas, adeoque mediocres.
</p>
<p>4. Ni ea res, &c. " Were it not that such a detail might draw
</p>
<p>me off too far from my subject." Ea res is regarded by some as
</p>
<p>an archaism for id ; but this mode of expression occurs in the best
</p>
<p>writers, though Sallust uses it more frequently than others.
</p>
<p>b. Res cunctas. For cuncta. Consult preceding note.  Cele-
</p>
<p>brat obscuratque. "Raises to eminence, and, again, buries in
</p>
<p>oblivion."
</p>
<p>6. Scriptorum magna ingenia. More elegant than scriptores
</p>
<p>magni ingenii, which is, however, the meaning of the phrase :
</p>
<p>"writers of great talent." Compare Curtius (3, 2, 13,) robora
</p>
<p>virorum, for viri robusiissimi, and Catullus, (64, 4,) robora pubis,
</p>
<p>for adolescentes robusti. The writers to whom Sallust alludes are,
</p>
<p>without doubt, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, &c. Some
</p>
<p>critics have regarded scriptorum in this passage as a mere gloss,
</p>
<p>especially as some manuscripts omit it, and others place it after
</p>
<p>ingenia, but its presence is necessary to the sense.
</p>
<p>7. Earn. Referring to virtutem understood. Some editors read
</p>
<p>ea, understanding facta.  Ea copia. " That advantage." Kuhn-
</p>
<p>hardt thinks copia equivalent to multitudo, but incorrectly we con-
</p>
<p>ceive. If his explanation, however, should be preferred, ea copia,
</p>
<p>may be rendered, " the same number cf able historians."

<p>11. In suppliciis. " In the worship." Supplicium signifies botn
</p>
<p>"punishment" and "supplication," "worship," or "sacrifice."
</p>
<p>Scheller's explanation is perfectly satisfactory. He makes the
</p>
<p>primitive import of the term, " a kneeling down." This may be
</p>
<p>done either to supplicate the Deity, whence we have the kindred
</p>
<p>meaning of " religious worship ;" or it may be for the purpose of
</p>
<p>being beheaded, whence we deduce the meaning of " punishment."

<p>(Scheller, Lateinisch-Deutsches Worterb. s. v.)
</p>
<p>12. Ubi pax evenerat. Sallust uses this moie of expression and
</p>
<p>not in pace, for the purpose of showing that the Romans neither
</p>
<p>avoided war nor courted peace ; but, whenever the latter chanced
</p>
<p>to arrive, proved themselves not unworthy of enjoying it, by the
</p>
<p>justice and moderation of their conduct.  Seque remque publi-

</p>
<p>ministration of the republic."
</p>

<p>saepius. We have rejected it with Cortius as being sufficiently

<p>implied from the context.

<p>tabant, the frequentative is here used for the simple agebant.

</p>
<p> Neglegere. The old form for negligere. The infinitives neglegere

</p>
<p>Dy Cortius, making contagio an ablative from the old form conta- QA
</p>
<p>gium: {Contagio quasi, "by a sort of moral contagion.") The
</p>
<p>Bipont edition removes the comma after quasi, placing one after
</p>
<p>contagio, and another after pestilentia. Contagio then becomes the
</p>
<p>nominative to invasit. In either reading, contagio has vitiorum
</p>
<p>understood.
</p>
<p>11. Propius virtutem erat. Sailust means, that ambition, though
</p>
<p>a vice, has some affinity to virtue, which cupidity has not. Virtutem
</p>
<p>is governed by ad understood. We find the preposition supplied in
</p>
<p>Plautus, (Mil. Glor. 4, 6, 55,) " Si accesserit prope ad te ;" and
</p>
<p>again, (Mostell. 2, 2, 30,) " Fuge ad me propius."
</p>
<p>12. Bonus, ignavus. " The man who has merit and he who is
</p>
<p>devoid of it."  Vera via. "By the true path," i. e. by fair and
</p>
<p>honourable means.
</p>
<p>13. Studium habet. " Implies the desire."
</p>
<p>14. Venenis malis. "With poisons." Venenum, like f acinus ^
</p>
<p>&c, is what the grammarians call medium nomen. It properly
</p>
<p>signifies " that which by its penetrating influence changes the natural
</p>
<p>qualities of any thing." As this may be either beneficial or injurious,
</p>
<p>venenum hence may indicate in the latter case " a poison," and in
</p>
<p>the former " a drug," " a medicine," " a colouring matter." In this
</p>
<p>passage Sailust uses the term in its strict acceptation, and therefore
</p>
<p>adds the qualifying adjective ; so that venenis malis, when literally
</p>
<p>rendered, will signify " with pernicious (or poisonous) drugs," i. e.
</p>
<p>poisons. This, after all, however, is somewhat of an affected
</p>
<p>archaism on the part of our historian, since the purest Latin writers
</p>
<p>are accustomed to use the word venenum, when standing alone, in a
</p>
<p>bad sense, without employing any adjective. The old form of ex-
</p>
<p>pression occurs in a law cited by Cicero, (pro Cluent. 54,) " Qui
</p>
<p>venenum malum fecit," &c. (Compare Ernesti and Schiitz, Index
</p>
<p>hat. Cic. s. v.) The term (pappaKov is another well known instance

<p>of a medium nomen. Herodotus uses it to express colours, (1, 98,)

<p>15. Neque copia, &c. The idea intended to be conveyed is this :
</p>
<p>He who possesses much is as strongly influenced by the desire of
</p>
<p>having more, as he whose present resources are scanty ; and while
</p>
<p>want urges on the latter, the possession of abundant means does not
</p>
<p>quench the thirst for gain in the former. The desire of wealth makes
</p>
<p>both of them its slaves.

<p>hands of his opponents." Alluding to Sylla's final overthrow of the

<p>^ to be succeeded by an evil issue." The first acts of SyJla, upon his
</p>
<p>attaining to the unlimited control of the state, argued well for its
</p>
<p>interests. He favoured the party of the nobility, which Marius,
</p>
<p>plebeian in origin, had always sought to depress, and he seemed on
</p>
<p>the point also of reviving the ancient constitution. The mask,
</p>
<p>however, was soon dropped, and the most horrid excesses ensued.
</p>
<p>Compare Velleius Paterculus, (2, 25,) " Putares Sullam venisse in
</p>
<p>Italiam, non belli vindicem, sed pads auctorem," &c, and also
</p>
<p>Cicero, (de Off. 2, 8,) " Secuta est honestam causam non honesta
</p>
<p>victoria."
</p>
<p>17. Neque modum, &c. " The victors knew no limit, and prac-
</p>
<p>tised no self-restraint."-  In civibus. "Among their fellow-
</p>
<p>citizens," or " in the case of their fellow-citizens." The common
</p>
<p>text has in cives. The present reading was first given by Wasse,
</p>
<p>from a manuscript. " Pereleganter" observes the critic in speak-
</p>
<p>ing of this lection, "nescioanvere, certe supra, captum librariorum.
</p>
<p>He then refers in support of it to Virgil Aen 2, 541. Ovid. Met.
</p>
<p>1, 442. Cic. N. D. 1, 42, &c. He gives also in amicis, in the 9th
</p>
<p>chapter of the present narrative.  Quern in Asia ductaverat. Cor-
</p>
<p>tius reads Asiam, giving in the force of intra.
</p>
<p>QJ 1. Amoena. Amoenus most commonly denotes what is pleasing
</p>
<p>to the eye, while voluptarius properly refers to the senses. The!
</p>
<p>expressions in the text may be rendered as follows : " A delightful
</p>
<p>country, the abode of pleasure."  Amare, potare. " To indulge
</p>
<p>in the excesses of licentiousness and intoxication." Potare is " to
</p>
<p>drink to excess," " to be addicted to drinking." " Bibunt sobrii, ad
</p>
<p>naturae necessitatem ; potani ebriosi affluenter, et ad ebrietatem."
</p>
<p>(Popma.) As Sallust means to say that the Roman soldiers had
</p>
<p>acquired in Asia the habit of drinking to excess, bibere would evi-
</p>
<p>dently have been inadmissible in the text.

</p>
<p>{Lex. Antibarb.) defines it, " Aedicula, in qua stat Dei cu jus dam
</p>
<p>simulacrum; parvum templum, vel pars templi." The capitol was
</p>
<p>called Templum, in which there were three Delubra inclosed by a
</p>
<p>common wall, namely Jupiter's, Juno's, and Minerva's. In this
</p>
<p>passage of Sallust, the word may be rendered " shrines."

<p>4. Innocentia, &c. " A life of innocence in another was regarded }?%
</p>
<p>*s the mere offspring of a malevolent feeling," i. e. they gave him
</p>
<p>who led a virtuous life no credit for sincerity, but supposed him to
</p>
<p>be actuated merely by a spirit of malevolence and opposition, and a
</p>
<p>wish to set his own mode of life in direct contrast with that of the
</p>
<p>profligate, in order that it might carry with it a tacit censure on the
</p>
<p>conduct of the latter.
</p>
<p>5. Kapere, consumere. " They plundered, they wasted."
</p>
<p>6. Pudorem, pudicitiam, &c. " Modesty, chastity, things divine
</p>
<p>and human without distinction, they utterly disregarded, and in their
</p>
<p>violation of them acted without the least compunction or self-
</p>
<p>restraint." Seneca (de Benef. 1, 9) has borrowed some of his
</p>
<p>ideas and expressions from this and the preceding passages of
</p>
<p>Sallust. "Jam rapta sparger e, sparsa pari avaritia recolligere
</p>
<p>certant : nihil pensi habere, paupertatem alienam contemnere, suam
</p>
<p>timere, nullum alium vereri malum :" &c.
</p>
<p>7. Verum. This term is used here to denote strong indignation
</p>
<p>Compare the remarks of Drakenborch (ad. Lav. 45, 19) on the em-
</p>
<p>phatic vero.
</p>
<p>8. Praeter injuriae licentiam. " Except the power of injuring."
</p>
<p>9. Victor es. Some manuscripts have metis instead of victor xs,
</p>
<p>but the former is implied in the latter, and therefore need not be
</p>
<p>expressed. Other manuscripts give hostibus, but this again is
</p>
<p>already implied in the term sociis. " Quasi socios istos" observes
</p>
<p>Cortius, u non olim hostes fuisse per se constet."
</p>
<p>10. Constructa. " Built up," or " constructed." The historian
</p>
<p>refers to the piscinae, or fish-ponds, which the wealthy Romans
</p>
<p>caused to be formed, generally on the seashore, by the damming up
</p>
<p>of the waters, and which were commonly of such vast dimensions
</p>
<p>as almost to deserve the name of seas. Some editions, however,
</p>
<p>read constrata, " built upon," referring to the splendid residences of
</p>
<p>many of the Roman nobility, built on large artificial moles projecting

<p>into the sea. Contracta, whieh other manuscripts present, is pro
</p>
<p>bably a mere gloss. If otherwise considered, it may be supposed to
</p>
<p>allude to the encroachments made upon the limits of the ocean by
</p>
<p>these moles and marine palaces. Compare, as regards this last-

<p>reading, Horace, (Carm. 3, 1, 33,) " Contracta pisces aequora

</p>
<p>1 1 . Turpidinem. An old form for turpitudinem. The nomina-
</p>
<p>ive turpido occurs in Tertullian (decor, mil. c. 14.) Gesner thinks
</p>
<p>this an error for turpitudo, but without any necessity.

<p>14 Animus imbutus, &c. " The heart, once contaminated by
</p>
<p>evil inclinations, could not easily forego the gratification of its vicious

<p>propensities." By lubidinibus are here properly meant the ruling
</p>
<p>propensities and desires of the heart.

<p>JJ(> 1. In tantatamque corrupta civitate, &c. The student will ob-
</p>
<p>serve with what peculiar force the mention of Catiline's conspiracy
</p>
<p>is re-introduced, after the masterly picture of Roman corruption
</p>
<p>which has just preceded.
</p>
<p>2. Flagitiorum atque facinorum. For flagitiosorum atque faci-
</p>
<p>norosorum, the abstract for the concrete. " Of all kinds of profli-
</p>
<p>gate and daring spirits." Facinus, as w r e have already observed in
</p>
<p>a previous note, means a bold or daring action. Flagitium, though
</p>
<p>generally referring to lustful excess, denotes any fault, error, or
</p>
<p>crime, which reflects more or less disgrace on the offender ; and im
</p>
<p>plies a less degree of moral guilt than scelus. ( Crombie's Gymna
</p>

<p>impunity for some disgraceful or daring offence."
</p>
<p>4. Convicti judiciis. " Persons convicted on trial."
</p>
<p>5. Quos manus, &c. Manus refers to sanguine civili, lingua to
</p>
<p>perjurio. Compare Cicero, (2, in Cat 4,) " Quis tota Italia vene-
</p>
<p>ficus, quis gladiator, quis latro, quis sicarius, quis parricida, quis
</p>
<p>testamentorum subjector, quis circumscripta, quis ganeo, quis

<p>quis corruptus, quisperditus inveniri potest, qui se cum Catilinanon

<p>or net of the hunter.

<p>8. Par similisque ceteris. Par refers to internal resemblance,
</p>
<p>mtiilis to external, Hence the clause may be rendered, " as cor-
</p>
<p>rupt in principle, and as profligate in conduct as the rest."
</p>
<p>9. Aetate fluxi. " Pliant in consequence of their years."
</p>
<p>10. Modestiae suae. " His own honour." Modcxtia is here
</p>
<p>used hi the sense ofpudor, and marks the utter corruption of Catiline.
</p>
<p>11. Obnoxios. " Dependant upon." Obnoxius properly denotes
</p>
<p>a dependance founded upon a consciousness of crime, and a dread
</p>
<p>of being exposed to punishment in case we disobey him who is privy
</p>
<p>to our guilt.

<p>12. Cumvirgine nobili. Who the female here alluded to was gg
</p>
<p>s not clearly ascertained. It is generally thought that trie histo-
</p>
<p>nans of those times suppressed the name out of respect for the noble
</p>
<p>lineage to which she belonged. The daughter who was the offspring
</p>
<p>of this intercourse is spoken of by Plutarch, (pit. Cic. 10, ed. Hut'
</p>
<p>ten, vol. 5, p. 318,) and is referred to by Cicero, (frag, or at. in tog.
</p>
<p>cand. ed. Ernesti, vol. 7, p. 1052,) " Cum ex eodem stupro," &c.
</p>
<p>13. Sacerdote Vestae. The vestal of whom mention is hers
</p>
<p>made was Fabia Terentia. She was brought to trial by Clodius
</p>
<p>for a violation of her vow. Several of the most respectable citizens,
</p>
<p>however, either convinced of her innocence, or wishing to thwart the
</p>
<p>tribune, exerted themselves in her defence with such success, that
</p>
<p>she not only obtained sentence of acquittal, but her prosecutor was
</p>
<p>obliged to flee from Rome. Cato, Catulus, and Cicero, espoused
</p>
<p>her cause. She was the sister of Terentia, the wife of Cicero. In the
</p>
<p>picture w r hich Cicero draws of the scandalous misdeeds of Catiline,
</p>
<p>no mention is made by him of this incident, probably out of respect
</p>
<p>for his sister-in-law.  The Vestal virgins were introduced at Rome
</p>
<p>Dy Numa, in imitation of a similar priesthood existing at Alba.
</p>
<p>They were originally four in number. Two were subsequently
</p>
<p>added by Tarquinius Priscus, or by Servius Tullius, and six con
</p>
<p>tinued to be the number ever after. These priestesses had charge
</p>
<p>of the sacred fire, and were bound to inviolable chastity. When
</p>
<p>convicted of dishonour, they were buried alive in the campus scele
</p>
<p>ratus, and their paramours scourged to death in the forum. ( Vid.
</p>
<p>Lipsius de Vesta et Vestalibus, Antv. 1603.)
</p>
<p>14. Jus fasque. "Human and divine law." Thus Isidorus
</p>
<p>(Orig. 5, 11) remarks, " Fas lex divina est, jus lex humana."
</p>
<p>15. Aureliae Orestillae. The sister or daughter of Cneius An
</p>
<p>relius Orestis, who was praetor, A. U. C. 677.

<p>in marriage," is used when a man is the subject of discourse, or the
</p>
<p>nominative to the verb. Nubere, " to veil," or duci, " to be led," is
</p>
<p>used when a woman is the subject of discourse, or nominative to
</p>
<p>the verb. The ellipsis is supplied in the case of the former verb, by
</p>
<p>domum, in the latter by se. Thus, Ttane tandum uxor em (domum)
</p>
<p>duxit Antipho 1 because the husband led the bride to his own abode
</p>
<p>from her father's house. Tullio (se) nupsii, literally, " she has
</p>
<p>Tened herself for Tullius," because the brid was veiled during the
</p>
<p>ceremony of marriage. The same distinction holds good in Greek
</p>
<p>Detween ya^i, and yanioiiai, although depending on a different
</p>
<p>explanation. Thus ya^ioi. " I marry," is said of the rnsband, (tixo-

</p>
<p>cause myself to be led away in marriage by another," is said of the
</p>
<p>female, (nuho.) Compare Kuster de verbis mediis, p. 153.
</p>
<p>17. Privignum. " A son of his by a previous marriage."
</p>
<p>18. Necato jilio. Cicero alludes to this horrid deed in his first
</p>
<p>oration against Catiline, (c. 6.) Valerius Maximus is more explicit
</p>
<p>(9, 1,9.) He makes Catiline to have despatched his son with poi*
</p>
<p>son, (veneno sustulit.)
</p>
<p>19. Vacuam domum, &c. "He freed his home from every
</p>
<p>obstacle to this most wicked marriage. "
</p>
<p>20. Dis hominibusque infestus. " Obnoxious to the hatred of
</p>
<p>gods and men." Infestus is here used in what the grammarians
</p>
<p>denominate a passive sense.
</p>
<p>21. Ita conscientia, &c. A powerful expression. "To such a
</p>
<p>degree did conscience desolate his tortured spirit." Some editions
</p>
<p>read vexabat, others versabat. Both lections are inferior to the one
</p>
<p>which we have given.
</p>
<p>22. Colos exsanguis. " His complexion was deadly pale." 
</p>
<p>Foedi oculi. " His eyes had a ghastly look."  Facie vultuque. " In
</p>
<p>his features, and in the whole expression of his countenance."
</p>
<p>23. Sed jutentutem, &c. The commencement of this chapter is
</p>
<p>connected with the end of the 14th, and the 15th intervenes in the

</p>
<p>and taught them to do the same. The term fortunas, in this pas-
</p>
<p>sage, is generally rendered " fortunes," i. e., property. It may
</p>
<p>be doubted, however, whether this meaning will suit here. Nei-

</p>
<p>ignotos homines et obvios, non in compendium, sed occidendi causa
</p>
<p>occidunt."
</p>
<p>6. Quod aes alienum, &c. " Because debts were heavy through-
</p>
<p>out all lands," i. e. because many citizens as well as others were
</p>
<p>involved in heavy debts in every quarter of the Roman world. This
</p>
<p>was the natural consequence of wide-spread luxury.
</p>
<p>7. Rapinarum et victoriae, &c. Sylla, after the final success of
</p>
<p>his arms, had assigned large tracts of land in Italy to his armed fol-
</p>
<p>lowers, and also the possessions of many of the proscribed. Ex
</p>
<p>travagant and dissolute living, however, soon scattered this ill-got-
</p>
<p>ten wealth, and consequent poverty made them ripe for any new
</p>
<p>commotion in the state. " Hi sunt homines" observes Cicero, " ex
</p>
<p>its coloniis, quas Sulla constituit, coloni, qui se inspe-
</p>
<p>ratis repentinisque pecuniis sumtuosius insolentiusque jactarunt :
</p>
<p>hi dum aediftcant, tamquam beati, dum praediis, lecticis, familiis
</p>
<p>magnis, conviviis apparatis delectantur, in tantum aes alienum
</p>
<p>inciderunt, ut, si salvi esse velint, Sulla sit iis ab inferis exa
</p>
<p>tandus." (2, in Cat. 9.)
</p>
<p>8. Terris. Pontus and Armenia. Pompey held this important
</p>
<p>command by virtue of the Manilian law, which was proposed by
</p>
<p>the tribune Manilius, and advocated by Cicero in a speech that is
</p>
<p>still extant.
</p>
<p>9. Consulatumpetundi. Ursinus proposes petenti, which is the
</p>
<p>reading of three manuscripts, on the ground that Catiline was
</p>
<p>already a candidate for the consulship. Amid the various opinions
</p>
<p>which have been advanced, we consider that of Planche the most
</p>
<p>correct. The period referred to in the text is the beginning of the
</p>
<p>year of Rome 690 : not long previous to this, (A. U. C. 688,) Cati-
</p>
<p>line, returning from the government of Africa, was accused of ex-
</p>
<p>tortion, and prevented from suing for the consulship, in conse-

<p>quence of this charge pending at the time. He was acquitted
</p>
<p>X. U. C. 689, and might therefore entertain " the hope of standing
</p>
<p>candidate for the consulship" at the commencement of the ensuing
</p>
<p>year.
</p>
<p>10. Senatus nihil sane intentus. " The senate without any
</p>
<p>distrust," or, " entirely unapprehensive of danger."
</p>
<p>11. Kalendas Junias. The Roman Calendar agreed with our
</p>
<p>own, in the number of months, and of the days in each ; but instead
</p>
<p>of reckoning in an uninterrupted series, from the first to the thirty-
</p>
<p>first, they had three points from which their days were counted. 
</p>
<p>1. The Calends or Kalends, which were always the first day of the
</p>
<p>month. They received their name from the old verb calare, be-
</p>
<p>232 NOTES TO THE

<p>Page.
</p>
<p>g"y cause the priests, who had the charge of the Calendar, were required
</p>
<p>to proclaim the first day of the month publicly to the people, and to
</p>
<p>mention at the same time, the number of days between the Calends
</p>
<p>and the Nones. This last was done, because it behoved the people
</p>
<p>who lived in the country, to assemble in the city on the Nones of
</p>
<p>each month, in order to be informed by the rex sacrorum of the
</p>
<p>feasts and holidays, and to learn in general what they had to do, in
</p>
<p>regard to sacred matters, during that month.  2. The Nones were,
</p>
<p>in the months of March, May, July, and October, on the seventh ;
</p>
<p>in all other months on the fifth. They were so called because
</p>
<p>there were nine days, counting inclusively, between them and the
</p>
<p>Ides.  3. The Ides were on the fifteenth of March, May, July, and
</p>
<p>October, and on the thirteenth of the other months. They were so
</p>
<p>named from the old verb iduare, because they nearly divided the
</p>
<p>month. The Romans always counted forwards to the Calends,
</p>
<p>Nones, or Ides, never backwards from them. After the first day of

<p>The municipia were foreign towns, *vhose inhabitants obtained the

<p>rights of Roman citizens. Of these th^re were different kinds. Some
</p>
<p>possessed all the rights of Roman citizens, except such as could not

<p>be enjoyed without residing at Rome. Others enjoyed the right of

</p>
<p>zes of praetor and consul, and was remarkable for the extent of his
</p>
<p>private wealth. Not long after the period of the conspiracy, he
</p>
<p>united with Pompey and Caesar in forming the first triumvirate.
</p>

</p>

<p>3. Legibus ambitus interrogate The laws against bribery were very
</p>
<p>severe. If the successful candidates were convicted of that crime
</p>
<p>upon trial, they were deprived of the consulship, and their competi-
</p>
<p>tors who accused them were nominated in their place. They were
</p>
<p>also, besides being fined, declared incapable of bearing any office,
</p>
<p>or of coming into the senate, by the Calpurnian and other laws.
</p>
<p>Cicero made the punishment of bribery still more severe by the
</p>
<p>Tullian law, which he caused to be passed through the authority of
</p>
<p>the senate, by the additional penalty of a ten years' exile.

<p>4. Poenas dederant. . In these, and similar phrases, it should be
</p>
<p>observed, that the proper meaning of the term poena is not " punish-

</p>
<p>tion," " to make atonement," or " to be punished :" and sumerepoe
</p>
<p>nas is, "to exact atonement," "to take satisfaction," or " to pun-

<p>money wrongfully obtained from an individual was demanded hack.
</p>
<p>Our English word extortion, though generally given as the transla-
</p>
<p>tion of the term, is not, however, comprehensive enough, since the
</p>
<p>action repetundarum, was brought not merely for the recovery of
</p>
<p>what had been extorted from the individual who complained, but

</p>
<p>the 17 immediately preceding. (Vid. Ernesti, Clav. Cic. voc. Tri~

</p>
<p>law to give in his name during these 17 days, and required at the

<p>whom, Caesar was connected with Piso in this conspiracy, and,
</p>
<p>while the latter attempted an insurrection against the government

<p>13. Fascibus correptis. " Having seized upon the consulai

<p>power." The fasces were a bundle of rods, with an axe tied in the

<p>middle of them, which were carried before the kings, and afterwards

<p>before the consuls, as an emblem of their power. Valerius Fopli-

<p>15. Ea re cognita. Suetonius {vit. Caes. 9.) makes mention of
</p>
<p>a plot in which Caesar and Crassus were said to have been en-
</p>
<p>gaged at this time. Their plan was to make an attack on the sen-
</p>
<p>ate at the beginning of the year, and, after they had slain w r hom
</p>
<p>they pleased of that body, for Crassus to assume the dictatorship
</p>
<p>and appoint Caesar his master of the horse. Crassus, either from
</p>
<p>repentance or fear, (poenitentia vel metu,) came not at the day ap
</p>
<p>pointed, and Caesar consequently did not give the signal which had
</p>
<p>been agreed upon, the dropping namely of his toga from his shoulders.
</p>
<p>The plot therefore failed. Suetonius makes no mention either of Cati-
</p>
<p>line or Piso as connected with this conspiracy, although it is evident
</p>
<p>that he and Sallust refer to one and the same event. A subsequent
</p>
<p>plot between Caesar and Piso has already been alluded to in note 7.
</p>
<p>16. Quod ni, &c. " And had not Catiline been too hasty in
</p>
<p>giving," &c. From the fondness of the Latin writers for the con-
</p>

</p>
<p>of quod before many conjunctions, merely as a copulative. (Zumpt.

<p>24. Sunt qui ita dicant. Strict Latinity requires dicant, which
</p>
<p>we have given therefore in place of the common reading dicunt. It
</p>
<p>must be confessed, however, that several instances occur, even in
</p>
<p>the best writers, of the indicative being thus used with the relative.
</p>
<p>(Vid. Scheller. pr accept, styli. vol. 1, p. 166. Heusinger ad Cic. de
</p>
<p>Off. 1, 24.) The subjunctive, however, on such occasions is cer-
</p>
<p>tainly preferable, and in some cases essential to perspicuity, other-
</p>
<p>wise the subject may be mistaken for the predicate. For example^
</p>
<p>if we say, "Sunt boni, qui dicunt" to express, " They are good men
</p>
<p>who say," and also, " There are good men who say," the expression
</p>
<p>is evidently ambiguous. This ambiguity is removed by expressing
</p>
<p>the former sentiment by " Sunt boni, qui dicunt" in which case the
</p>
<p>relative clause is the subject, and the antecedent clause the predi-
</p>
<p>cate ; and by expressing the latter sentiment by " Sunt boni, qui
</p>
<p>dicant" where the antecedent clause is the subject, and the relative
</p>
<p>clause the predicate. (Vid. Crombie's Gymnasium, vol. 2, p. 21.)

</p>
<p>26. Adgressos. For aggressos. This is generally termed an gg
</p>
<p>rchaism ; but, according to Scheller, it is a question whether the
</p>
<p>ancients ever altered the form of the preposition when in composi-
</p>
<p>tion. He considers it always more accurate to retain as far as
</p>
<p>possible the prepositions in an unaltered form, as adfero, adtuli,
</p>
<p>adlatum; inretio, inmergo, &c. (Scheller, L. G. vol. 1, p. 129.)
</p>
<p>27. Praeterea. " In any other instance."  In medio relinquemus.
</p>
<p>Some editions have relinquimus. In medio relinquere is "to leave
</p>
<p>undetermined."
</p>
<p>1. In rem. " Of advantage."  Universos. "All, at one and 89
</p>
<p>the same time." Some critics have defined universi as meaning,
</p>
<p>M all at one time," while cuncti denotes " all in one place." The
</p>
<p>present passage favours such a distinction, although instances are
</p>
<p>frequently met with where it is not observed, and where universi
</p>
<p>merely signifies " all together," or " considered as one aggregate."
</p>
<p>(Quasi ad unum versi.)
</p>
<p>2. Aedium. " Of the house." The primitive meaning of aedes,
</p>
<p>in the singular, is " an apartment," or " room." Hence it denotes,
</p>
<p>in the same number, " a temple," i. e. an apartment or chamber for
</p>
<p>divine worship. In the plural it means " a house," i. e. a collection
</p>
<p>of apartments under one roof.
</p>
<p>3. Arbitris. " Witnesses." Noltenius defines arbiter to be,
</p>
<p>according to its primitive import, " Occulte adrepens, qui suis oculis
</p>
<p>videt, suisque auribus audit." The most probable opinion is, that
</p>
<p>it is derived from the obsolete verb bitere, " to go," being com-
</p>
<p>pounded of ar for ad, and biter e, in the same way as we have arcesso
</p>
<p>for acUesso. Testis means " a witness," chiefly in a cause or
</p>
<p>trial. " One who bears testimony." (Crombie's G-ymn. vol. 1, p.
</p>
<p>309.)
</p>
<p>4. Neque ego, &c. The personal pronouns in Latin are seldom

<p>10. Tetrarchae. " Tetrarchs." Tetrarcha originally signified
</p>
<p>one who ruled over the fourth part of a country or kingdom, (from
</p>
<p>rirrapa and dpx^i-) Afterwards, however, the tern* merely came to
</p>
<p>denote a minor or inferior potentate, without any reference to the
</p>
<p>extent of territory governed. Thus, according to Strabo, Gallo-
</p>
<p>Graecia in Asia Minor was governed at first by twelve tetrarchs,
</p>
<p>afterwards by three, and lastly by two, previous to its being made a
</p>
<p>kingdom.
</p>
<p>11. Vectigales. Strictly speaking, the Stipendiarii, or Tribu-
</p>
<p>tarii, were those who paid their taxes in money ; and the Vectigales
</p>
<p>were those who gave a certain part of the produce of the soil to the
</p>
<p>republic. The words, however, as in the present instance, are
</p>
<p>sometimes confounded.
</p>
<p>12. Populi, natiaaes, &c. Gens is the root or stock, containing
</p>
<p>many families, (familiae,) or even nations, (nationes.) It is the
</p>
<p>generic term in respect to natio and familia. Thus the Germans
</p>
<p>may be called gens, the Saxons natio ; or, if we rise higher, the
</p>
<p>Europeans may be called gens, the Germans natio. Gens is even
</p>
<p>sometimes applied to the whole human race ; as, " Gens hominum
</p>
<p>est huic belluae adversa." {Plin. H. N. 8, 25.) Populus is more
</p>
<p>extensive than natio, but in general less so than gens, though in-
</p>
<p>stances are not unfrequent where populus and gens directly coincide.
</p>
<p>The term populi in the text may be rendered by " communities."

<p>turn" The term has no reference whatever to engraving, but is
</p>
<p>confined to work adorned with bass-relief. " Allein da es vom Metall

</p>
<p>beziehen ; und, da es nur erhobne Arbeit anzeigt, so lasst sich ohne

</p>
<p>4. Nova diruunt. " Though they pull down edifices but recently
</p>
<p>erected." Some prefer vetera, as a reading, in place of nova, but
</p>
<p>this weakens the sense. In support of the present lection, compare
</p>
<p>Suetonius, (vit. Caes. 46,) " Munditmrum lautitiarumque studio-
</p>

</p>
<p>5. Trahunt, vexant. " Though they squander, though they lavish
</p>
<p>in the wildest extravagance." Trahunt is here equivalent to dis-
</p>
<p>trahunt, and vexant to insano luxu disperdunt.
</p>
<p>6. Summa lubidine. " By the most lavish and capricious ex-
</p>
<p>penditure."
</p>
<p>7. Mala res, &c. " Our present condition is a wretched one, our
</p>
<p>hope of the future worse."

</p>
<p>possessed neither property nor any hopes of lawfully acquiring it."

<p>12. Tabulas novas. "An abolition of debts." The ordinary
</p>
<p>writing materials of the Romans were tablets covered with wax,
</p>
<p>paper, and parchment. Their stylus was broad at one end ; so that
</p>
<p>when they wished to correct or erase any thing, they turned the
</p>
<p>stylus, and smoothed the wax with the broad end, after which the
</p>
<p>tablets might be written on anew. Hence when debts were dis-

<p>scription. Upon his return to the city, after having overthrow*
</p>
<p>the party of Marius, he wrote down the names of those whom h
</p>
<p>doomed to die, and ordered them to he fixed up in the public places
</p>
<p>of the city, with the promise of a certain reward (duo talenta) for
</p>
<p>the head of each person so proscribed. New lists (tabulae proscrip-
</p>
<p>tionis) were repeatedly exposed, as new victims occurred to his
</p>
<p>memory or were suggested to him. The land and fortunes of the
</p>
<p>slain were divided among the friends of Sylla. Catiline promised

<p>a repetition of these enormities to his followers.

</p>
<p>significant of express and certain engagements and those made by
</p>
<p>stronger affirmations, is employed only in a good sense, as exciting

<p>20. Popularis. " The accomplices." Understand sooios.
</p>
<p>QO 1. Sumtam mutuant. " Borrowed." Hill derives the adjective
</p>
<p>mutuus from mutare, and makes it imply a change of the thing lent,
</p>
<p>and a return made by an equivalent. Whereas commodate, " to
</p>
<p>lend," supposes the subject restored as it was given. (Synonyms,
</p>
<p>p. 210.) There is some doubt, however, whether the etymcfogy
</p>
<p>here assigned to mutuus be correct. Yarro makes the Latin mu-
</p>
<p>tuum to be hoTtov among the Sicilian Greeks, which last is equiva-
</p>
<p>lent to %apis, " a favour," " an act of kindness," &c. And thus

<p>we have in a fragment of Sophron, [xoTtov ivri fxoi. Consult Midler,

<p>Etrusker, vol. 1, p. 12.
</p>
<p>2. Manlium. This Manlius had held a commission in the army
</p>
<p>of Sylla, under whom he had acquired considerable military experi-
</p>
<p>ence, and accumulated great wealth, which he soon dissipated by
</p>
<p>his excessive extravagance. Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Appian,
</p>
<p>write the name MdWios ; and hence it would seem that Mallius,
</p>
<p>which is the reading of a few manuscripts, is more correct than
</p>
<p>Manlius. The editions of Sallust, however, give the latter form,
</p>
<p>with very few exceptions.

<p>their sources of gain, but not to their luxurious indulgences." Neque

<p>Is here equivalent to et non.

<p>6. Servitia urbana. " The city slaves." Servitium, in the sin-

</p>
<p>erer, were not ungraceful. In the earlier period of the Roman Q2
</p>
<p>republic, both dancing and music were held in little repute. After
</p>
<p>the adoption of Grecian customs and habits, more regard was paid
</p>
<p>to them, and they met with less censure, especially music. In the
</p>
<p>corrupt ages of the empire, when public morals were at their lowest
</p>
<p>ebb, dancing of course came fully into vogue, and without any
</p>
<p>blame being attached to it. It may perhaps excite our surprise that
</p>
<p>he Romans should have condemned what we regard as so innocent
</p>
<p>an amusement ; but we should bear in mind, that the dancing which
</p>
<p>the Romans censured can only be compared with the worst species
</p>
<p>of our opera-dancing, since they had also their religious dances,
</p>
<p>those of the Salii in particular, which w r ere sanctioned by the prac-
</p>
<p>tice of ages. The Latin verb which we translate " to dance," pro-
</p>
<p>perly signifies, to leap high and frequently ; the corresponding Greek
</p>
<p>verb (op^co^at) has a similar meaning : Plato in his Cratylus explains
</p>
<p>it by usTcaypi^oi and raAAw : so Antiphanes in Athenaeus, p. 688,

</p>
<p>were far from contemptible."
</p>
<p>15. Facetiae. Facetiae denotes gracefulness in general, or that
</p>
<p>elegance of wit and humour, which indicates a correct and delicate
</p>
<p>taste.  The primary idea implied in Lepos, and lepidus, is sweetness
</p>
<p>or softness, opposed to what is harsh and rough, and the term is
</p>
<p>confined to the mode of expression: whereas facetiae is applicable
</p>
<p>to the sentiment as well as the diction or gesture, designating the
</p>
<p>character of the mind, as possessed of taste and judgment. (Vid.
</p>
<p>Crombie's Gymnasium, vol. 2, p. 39.) If, after these premises, we

</p>
<p>19. Pactione provincial The province of Macedonia had fallen
</p>
<p>to the lot of Cicero, but he generously yielded it to Antonius, who,
</p>
<p>being in indigent circumstances by reason of his dissipated life, was
</p>
<p>the more easily inclined to receive a rich province as the price of
</p>
<p>his adherence to the state. Antonius held the government of Mace-
</p>
<p>donia for two years after the expiration of his consulship, and, on hi?
</p>
<p>return to Rome, was brought to trial and sentenced to perpetual
</p>
<p>banishment, for extortion, and for making war beyond the bounds
</p>
<p>of his province. (Liv. epit. 103.) Before his elevation to the con-
</p>
<p>sulship, the censors had expelled him from the senate. He appears
</p>
<p>to have been a man of profligate habits.
</p>
<p>20. Ne contra rempublicam, &c. " Not to cherish sentiments
</p>
<p>hostile to the well-being of the state."
</p>
<p>21. Clientium. The institution of patronage and clientship owed
</p>
<p>its origin to Romulus, according to the common account. That the
</p>
<p>patricians and plebeians might be connected together by the strictest
</p>
<p>bonds, the monarch ordained that every plebeian should choose from
</p>
<p>the patricians any one he pleased as his patron, or protector, whose
</p>
<p>client he was called. It was the part of the patron to advise and
</p>
<p>to defend his client, to assist him with his interest and substance
</p>
<p>in short, to do every thing for him that a parent uses to do for his
</p>
<p>children. The client was obliged to pay all kind of respect to his
</p>
<p>patron and to serve him with his life and fortune in any extremity.
</p>
<p>As regards the origin, however, of this relation between the two
</p>
<p>orders, it is more than probable that the common account is incor
</p>
<p>rect. The institution of patronage would seem to have sprung from
</p>
<p>a state of society in which a superior caste exercised sway over an
</p>
<p>inferior one : nor is this one of the least interesting objects of
</p>
<p>inquiry connected with the early history of Rome.

<p>5. Cum telo esse. " Carried a weapon about with him." Thi?
</p>
<p>phraseology is adopted from a law of the twelve tables, by which it
</p>
<p>was forbidden to wear any weapon in the city. Compare Cicero,
</p>
<p>[pro Milone, 4,) " Quae (lex) non modo hominem occidi, sed esse
</p>
<p>cum telo hominis occidendi causa vetat" Upon any sudden provo-
</p>
<p>cation the Romans used the graphium or stylus as a weapon, which
</p>
<p>,hey carried in a case. Hence probably the origin of the word stiletto

<p>in Italian.

</p>
<p>habet idoneum tempus rebus gerendis."
</p>
<p>9. M. Porcium Laecam. This individual has already been men
</p>
<p>tioned in the 17th chapter. According to Cicero, (1 in Cat. 4,  pro

<p>Sulla, 18,) the meeting was held in the house of Laeca, on the night
</p>
<p>of the 6th November, (" ea nocte, quae consecuta est posterum diem
</p>
<p>nonarum Novembris, me (Cicerone) consule") Sallust evidently
</p>
<p>places the time of this meeting too early : he seems to have been
</p>
<p>under the impression that it was held about the close of October,
</p>
<p>since he only mentions the accusation of L. Paullus against Catiline
</p>
<p>(which occurred on the 22d October) in the 31st chapter. Cicero's
</p>
<p>account agrees with Sallust's as to this having been merely a par-
</p>
<p>tial meeting at the house of Laeca : " convenisse eodem complures
</p>
<p>ejusdem amentiae scelerisque socios." Dio Cassius only states that
</p>
<p>Catiline directed his accomplices to assemble by night at a certain
</p>
<p>house, (es OLKiav riva cvWeyrlvai. 37, 32.)

<p>lectulo inter fectur os pollicerentur." (1 in Cat. 4.) The discrepancy,
</p>
<p>however, may easily be removed by supposing that Vargunteius,
</p>
<p>although a senator, was of equestrian extraction and rank. Plu-
</p>

<p>11. Ea nocte paullo post, &c. " Paullo post intempestam noc-
</p>
<p>tem" observes Cortius, " hoc est primo mane, illud enim tempus
</p>
<p>salutationum erat." It was the custom at Rome for the consuls to
</p>
<p>hold their levees early in the morning.

<p>15. Sullanis colonis. The soldiers of Sylla, settled as colonists
</p>
<p>on the lands of the Etrurians. Compare Cicero, (2, in Cat. 9,
</p>
<p>" Hi sunt homines ex Us coloniis quas Sulla constituit," &c.
</p>
<p>16. Ancipiti malo. " By the double danger," i. e. both within
</p>
<p>and without the city.
</p>
<p>Q 17. Private consilio. " By his own private vigilance," or, "by
</p>
<p>his single management."
</p>
<p>1. Rem ad senatum refert. " He lays the matter before the
</p>
<p>senate." Dahl supposes this to have taken place on the 19th or 21st
</p>
<p>of October.
</p>
<p>2. Volgi rumoribus exagitatam. " Noised abroad by reason of
</p>
<p>the popular rumours." Cortius prefers exagitatum, though he retains
</p>
<p>the common reading : exagitatum would refer to the senate being
</p>
<p>agitated and alarmed by the popular rumours, previous to Cicero's
</p>
<p>formal reference.
</p>
<p>3. In atroci negotio. " In a dangerous emergency."
</p>
<p>4. Ea potestas, &c. Cortius considers ea as an ablative, with

<p>formula decreti, or some other equivalent expression, understood.
</p>
<p>This interpretation appears to us rather forced : we would prefer
</p>
<p>rendering the passage as follows : " This is the highest authority
</p>
<p>which, in accordance with Roman usage, is bestowed upon any
</p>
<p>magistrate." The whole passage forms a " locus classicus" in

<p>relation to the meaning and limits of the famous decree to which it
</p>
<p>alludes. The decree was called Ultimum or Extremum. By it
</p>
<p>the republic was said to be entrusted to the consuls. For 120 years
</p>
<p>before Sylla, the creation of a dictator was disused ; but in danger-
</p>
<p>ous emergencies the consuls were armed with dictatorial power by
</p>
<p>a decree of this nature.
</p>
<p>5. Imperium atque judicium, &c. " To exercise the highest
</p>
<p>military and civil control." Imperium, as opposed to Magistrate
</p>
<p>or Potestas, denotes military power or authority.

</p>
<p>Cortms, and others, however, prefer nulli. It is questioned whether QA
</p>
<p>nulli be the dative case, according to the common form of declining,
</p>
<p>or the genitive, according to the older mode of inflection. It is
</p>
<p>thought by many that the position of the words strongly favours the
</p>
<p>latter opinion. We take the liberty of dissenting from this. The
</p>
<p>common mode of explaining the passage we consider perfectly
</p>
<p>unexceptionable : " without an express order of the people, no con-
</p>
<p>sul has the right of interfering in these things."
</p>
<p>7. Recitavit. "Read aloud."  Legere. " To read," " to peruse
</p>
<p>with the eyes without uttering any sound."  Recitare. " To read
</p>
<p>aloud that others may hear." Compare Noltenius Lex. Antibarb,
</p>
<p>vol. 1, page 1146, seqq.
</p>
<p>8. Ante diem sextum Kalendas Novembris. " On the sixth day
</p>
<p>before the Kalends of November," i. e. the 27th October. The
</p>
<p>Latin phrase is equivalent to die sexto ante Kalendas, or, according
</p>
<p>to the more usual form, sexto Kalendas. Ernesti and others make
</p>
<p>diem to be governed by in understood, which is expressed in many
</p>
<p>instances. Compare Cicero, Phil. 3, 8, " in ante diem iv. Kal.
</p>
<p>Dec." &c, and 1, in Cat. 3, "Dm ego idem in senatu, cae-
</p>
<p>dem te optimatum contulisse in ante diem v. Kal. Novembres."
</p>
<p>Zumpt, in his larger grammar, thinks that these apparently anoma-
</p>
<p>lous phrases probably arose from a transposition of ante ; and that
</p>
<p>having once written ante die tertio Kalendas, they would easily be
</p>
<p>led to change die into diem, as if it had been governed by ante. In
</p>
<p>his smaller grammar, (Bancroft's transl. p. 233,) he considers ante
</p>
<p>diem in the light of an unchangeable substantive, since prepositions
</p>
<p>which govern the accusative can be set before it. Compare the
</p>
<p>usage of pridie. " Nos in Formiano esse volumus usque ad pridie
</p>
<p>Nonas Maias." (Cic. ad Att. 2, 11.)

<p>QA 13. Calumnia paucorum. " By the cabalt of a few individuals.''
</p>
<p>Culumnia appears to be used here in a sense which approaches
</p>
<p>very nearly its primitive one. If Priscian's derivation of the term
</p>
<p>from the old verb calvo " to thwart," " to deceive," be the true one,
</p>
<p>(calutum in the supine being the intermediate step,) the origina.

<p>meaning of culumnia will be, "unfair practices," "cavils," "ca-

<p>bals," &c.

</p>
<p>15. Permissum. "Full power was given.'- Permittere is " to
</p>
<p>permit," "to give leave," "to empower." In the treatise addressed
</p>
<p>to Herennius, permissio is denned to be, " Rem trader e, et alicujus
</p>
<p>voluntati concedere." Mandatum, on the other hand, corresponds
</p>
<p>very nearly to our English word " commission."
</p>
<p>16. Pro tempore, &c. " Proportioned to the exigency and the

<p>danger."
</p>
<p>17. Sestertia centum. " One hundred thousand sestertii." One
</p>
<p>thousand sestertii made a sestertium, which is the name of a sum, not
</p>
<p>of a coin. The common mode of reckoning among the Romans
</p>
<p>was by sestertii or nummi. The sestertius, " sesterce," was a
</p>
<p>silver coin worth originally two asses and a half, and marked by the
</p>
<p>letters L. L. S. for libra, libra, semis, (two pounds and a half of cop-
</p>
<p>per,) sometimes abbreviated by contracting L. L. into H, thus H. S.
</p>
<p>unless H be an abbreviation or corruption from I. I. or two marks
</p>
<p>of unity, which is far more probable. The oldest Roman money
</p>
<p>was of brass ; and an as, as a coin, was originally a pound of cop-
</p>
<p>per. But after silver began to be coined, (some years before the
</p>
<p>first Punic war,) the as was made to weigh less, at first ^-, then ^
</p>
<p>then %\ , of the original weight, so that the coin, which at first had
</p>
<p>weighed a pound, at last weighed but half an uncia. Of silver
</p>
<p>coins the denarius was originally equal to 10 asses, and the sester
</p>
<p>tius, as above mentioned, to two asses and a half. Hence the name
</p>
<p>sestertius, which is shortened from semistertius ; i. e. the first an
</p>
<p>as, the second an as, the third a half as. ( Vid. Schweighacuser ad

</p>
<p>ever, to ^~ 2 of a pound, the denarius became equal to 16 asses, and
</p>
<p>the sestertius, or quarter of a denarius, was worth now 4 asses. A
</p>
<p>denarius weighed about 73 Paris grains, but under the first empe-
</p>
<p>rors it was gradually diminished to 63 ; so that in the times of the
</p>
<p>republic 84 made a pound ; but under Domitian, it took from 96 to
</p>
<p>100. As the silver used in that coin was but little debased by
</p>
<p>alloy, we may assume that a denarius was equal to a very little
</p>
<p>more than 15 cents of our money ; a sestertius therefore was equal

</p>
<p>were kept and maintained in schools {in ludis) by persons called

</p>
<p>under one lanista was called familia. Gladiators were at first
</p>
<p>composed of captives and slaves, or of condemned malefactors.

<p>But afterwards, in the days of the emperors, even free-born citizens,

<p>induced by hire or inclination, fought on the arena, some too of

</p>
<p>a meaning which cannot apply here with any peculiar meaning or

<p>definite force. It appears to us that " devotion to public amuse-
</p>
<p>ments" will suit the context better. Dureau de Lamalle translates
</p>
<p>the word in question by "licence dissolue."
</p>

<p>7. In senatum venit. This took place on the sixth day Defore
</p>
<p>the ides of November, (the 8th of the month, according to our mode
</p>
<p>of reckoning,) and the meeting of the senate was held in the tem-
</p>
<p>ple of Jupiter Stator, where Cicero had convened that body. The
</p>
<p>attempt on the consul's life (vid. chap. 28,) was made the day pre-
</p>
<p>vious. Cicero informs us that Catiline was shunned by all the
</p>
<p>assembled senators. (Cic. in Cat. 2, 6.)
</p>
<p>8. Praesentiam ejus timens. Catiline's presence in the senate,
</p>
<p>on this occasion, was probably feared by Cicero for two reasons :
</p>
<p>first, lest, with the aid of those members who were implicated in
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, he might break forth into some act of violence ; and,
</p>
<p>secondly, lest the very circumstance of his openly appearing in that
</p>
<p>assembly, might lead many to believe that he was an innocent and
</p>
<p>calumniated man.
</p>
<p>9. Orationem habuit, &c. "Delivered an oration, brilliant in
</p>
<p>itself and beneficial in its results to the republic." The speech, to
</p>
<p>which allusion is here made, was the first oration against Catiline.
</p>
<p>So splendid a burst of extemporaneous eloquence deserves far
</p>
<p>higher encomiums than the cold and formal praise bestowed by the
</p>
<p>historian. This oration of Cicero proved of service to the state
</p>
<p>on two accounts : it rendered the conspiracy formed against the
</p>
<p>republic so clear, that no one could doubt its existence, and it com-
</p>
<p>pelled Catiline to retire from the city.
</p>
<p>10. Quam postea scriptam edidit. "Which he afterwards com-
</p>

<p>" this oration must have been perfectly electric. The disclosure

</p>
<p>civis properly denoted one who was not born at Rome, but who
</p>
<p>possessed the rights of citizenship, having no house of his own, but
</p>
<p>occupying a hired lodging. Cicero, who was born at Arpinum, is
</p>
<p>here sneeringly termed an adventitious citizen, lodging in the city.

<p>in the occasion alluded to in the text, Catiline attempted to address
</p>
<p>the house in defence of his conduct, before Cicero rose up ; but
</p>
<p>that when he began to speak, the senators interrupted him in such
</p>
<p>a manner that he could not be heard. He is silent respecting any
</p>
<p>reply having been made by him to the oration of the consul. It
</p>
<p>would appear from this, but more especially from a remark of
</p>
<p>Cicero, in his speech for Muraena, (chapter 25,) that the narrative
</p>
<p>of Sallust is here erroneous. According to Cicero, Catiline uttered
</p>
<p>u threat similar to that mentioned in the text, a few days before,
</p>
<p>when replying to Cato, who menaced him in the presence of the
</p>
<p>senate with a public trial. Cicero, moreover, (2 Cat. 6,) in giving
</p>
<p>an account to the people, on the following day, of what had passed
</p>
<p>in the senate when he openly charged Catiline with his guilt, states
</p>
<p>expressly that the latter, in spite of his boldness, did not dare to
</p>
<p>make any reply to his speech. We find the same remark also in
</p>
<p>the Orator, 37, 129. Floras and Valerius Maximus copy the error
</p>
<p>of Sallust.
</p>
<p>15. Parricidam. Catiline is here styled " a parricide," because
</p>
<p>plotting the destruction of his country, the common parent of all.
</p>
<p>Compare the language of Cicero, (21. Cat. 7,) " Te patria odit
</p>
<p>ac metuit, et jamdiu te nihil judicat nisi de parricidio suo cogi
</p>
<p>tare."

<p>a genitive and immediately after with ablatives. This change of
</p>
<p>case is not unfrequent in Sallust. Thus, " Poenam sibi oneri, im-
</p>
<p>punitatem perdundaereipublicae fore." (Cat. chap. 46.) " Ubividei
</p>
<p>neque per vim, neque insidiis opprimi posse." (Jug. chap. 7.) " Pie-

</p>
<p>account of us having been occasioned by the conduct of a usurer Qg
</p>
<p>named Lucius Papirius. It was passed A. U. C. 428, and ordained
</p>
<p>that no person should be held in fetters or stocks, except convicted
</p>
<p>Df a crime, and in order to punishment ; but that, for money due, the
</p>
<p>goods of the debtor, not his person, should be answerable. (Liv.
</p>
<p>8, 28.) Livy remarks of this law, that it broke one of the strongest
</p>
<p>bonds of credit. " Victum eo die, oh impotentem injuriam unius,
</p>
<p>ingens vinculum fidei." On this account, as may well be supposed,
</p>
<p>it was unfavourably received by the rich, and had to be re-enacted
</p>
<p>forty years afterwards, at the time of the secession to the Janiculum.
</p>
<p>6. Liberum corpus habere. The cruelty and oppression, which
</p>
<p>marked the conduct of the rich towards their unfortunate debtors
</p>
<p>occasioned most, if not all, of the disturbances that interfered with
</p>
<p>the earlier growth of the Roman state.
</p>
<p>7. Praetoris. To the praetors belonged the general administra-
</p>
<p>tion of public justice. The city praetor {praetor urbanus) is here
</p>
<p>alluded to : he took cognizance of all litigations between citizens
</p>
<p>The praetor peregrinus dispensed justice to foreigners at Rome, on
</p>
<p>to foreigners and citizens when involved in controversy.
</p>
<p>8. Major es vestrum. Almost all the manuscripts have vestri for
</p>
<p>vestrum; but, according to Aulus Gellius, (20, 6,) the oldest copies
</p>
<p>in his time exhibited vestrum. Correct Latinity requires this latter
</p>
<p>form in the present case. Nostri and vestri are used when the
</p>
<p>genitive denotes the object ; as amor nostri, cura nostri, miserere
</p>
<p>nostri, &c, bat nostrum and vestrum must be employed when the
</p>
<p>genitive indicates the subject ; as frequentia vestrum, contentio
</p>
<p>vestrum, &c. (Vid. Zumpt. L. G. p. 241.)
</p>
<p>9. Inopiae opitulati sunt. Alluding to the laws passed at various
</p>
<p>times for diminishing the rate of interest.
</p>
<p>10. Argentum aere solutum est. " Silver w r as paid with brass."
</p>
<p>The allusion is to the Valerian Law, de quadrante, proposed by L
</p>
<p>Valerius Flaccus, when consul, A. U. C. 667. By the provisions
</p>
<p>of this law, the fourth part only of the debt w T as paid, namely, an

</p>
<p>as for a sestertius, and a sestertius for a denarius ; or 25 for 100.
</p>
<p>and 250 for 1000. The sestertius was originally equal to two asset
</p>
<p>and a half ; and the denarius to ten ; when, however, the weight of
</p>
<p>the as was diminished to one ounce, a denarius passed for sixteen
</p>
<p>asses, and a sestertius for four, which proportion continued when
</p>
<p>the as was reduced to half an ounce. Velleius Paterculus (2, 23,)
</p>
<p>gpeaks of the Valerian law above mentioned, in terms of merited
</p>
<p>reprobation. " Valerius Flaccus, turpissimae legis auctor, qua
</p>
<p>creditoribus quadrantem solvi jusserat." Montesquieu, on the othei
</p>
<p>hand, praises this law. (U Esprit des Lois, 32, 22.) The erro i3

<p>as equivalent to usurae trientes, after being noticed and corrected
</p>
<p>by many of the learned, was finally removed from his work.
</p>
<p>11. Secessit. Three secessions of the people are recorded in
</p>
<p>Roman history. The first took place A. U. C. 260, on account of
</p>
<p>the severity of creditors, and was made to the sacred mount. {Liv.
</p>
<p>2, 32.) The second was occasioned by the conduct of Appius
</p>
<p>Claudius, the decemvir, and was made first to the Aventine and
</p>
<p>afterwards to the sacred mount. {Liv. 3, 50.) It happened A. U.
</p>
<p>C. 305. The third was produced by the same cause as the first,
</p>
<p>and was made to the Janiculum, A. U. C. 466. {Liv. epit. lib. 11.)
</p>
<p>12. Nemo bonus. " No. man of spirit."
</p>
<p>13. Amittit. "Parts with." The student will observe that perdtt
</p>
<p>would change entirely the spirit of the passage. Amittere is simply
</p>
<p>" to lose the possession of a thing which one has once had." Per-
</p>
<p>dere, on the other hand, is "to lose," " destroy," or " throw away
</p>
<p>uselessly or hurtfully." Thus, in the treatise addressed to Heren-
</p>
<p>nius, (4, 44,) we have the following : " Quod mihi bene videtur
</p>
<p>Decius intellexisse, qui se devovisse dicitur, et pro legionibus in
</p>
<p>hostes intulisse medios ; unde amisit vitam, at non perdidit." (Vid.
</p>
<p>Crombie's Gymnasium, vol. 1, p. 98.)
</p>
<p>14. Quonam modo, &c. " In what way we may perish, after
</p>
<p>having most effectually avenged our blood ;" i. e. how we may sell
</p>
<p>our lives as dearly as possible.
</p>
<p>15. Mar cius. The verb respondit is elegantly understood. Thus,
</p>
<p>Phaedrus, 1,25,8, "At Me, facer em mehercule, nisi esse scirem
</p>
<p>carnis te cupidum meae." {Vid. PalaireVs Latin Ellipses, p. 254.)
</p>
<p>16. Optumo cuique. " To each most eminent person." Optumo
</p>
<p>cuique is here equivalent to optimatibus singulis. From a com-
</p>
<p>parison of various passages in Cicero, it would appear that optimates,
</p>
<p>in that writer, denotes " persons distinguished by rank or political
</p>
<p>merit," and sometimes the former only. Crombie's Gymnasium,
</p>
<p>vol. 2, p. 107.

<p>This use of non quo for non quod has been very much disputed
</p>
<p>H. Stephens (Schediasm. 2, 7,) and Laurentius Valla {Eleg. 2, 37.)
</p>
<p>particularly oppose it. Tursellinus, on the other hand, successfully
</p>
<p>defends its correctness, both from the language of manuscripts and
</p>
<p>the usage of the best writers. {Turs. de Part. p. 494, ed. Lips.
</p>
<p>1769, and p. 240, ed. Bailey Lond. 1828.) It is, however, not to

<p>be denied, as Zumpt well observes, that it is safer in general to say

<p>non quod, non eo quod, non ideo quod, non quoniam, &c. {Zumpt

<p>18. Ex sua contenlxone. " From any private quarrel of his." Qg
</p>
<p>1). Earum exemplum. " A copy of it." Of course we must
</p>
<p>'egard the letter as genuine, and not the production of the historian.
</p>
<p>1. Q. Catulo S. The letter S is abbreviated from Salutem, Q^
</p>
<p>which is governed by dicit understood. The whole expression in
</p>
<p>;he text will be equivalent to " L. Catiline greets Q. Catulus," or,
</p>
<p>11 wishes him health." As regards the epistolary correspondence
</p>
<p>of the Romans, the following remarks may not be misplaced. If
</p>
<p>either of the parties was invested with an office, civil or military, it
</p>
<p>was usual to express it thus : " P. Serv. Rullus. Trib. pi. x. vir
</p>
<p>Pompeio Consuli." When the person addressed was an intimate
</p>
<p>friend, they sometimes added the epithets " Humanissimus"
</p>
<p>" Optimus," " Suavissimus," and very frequently " Suus," as
</p>
<p>" Praetor es Syracusani Mar cello suo." The " Praeloquium" was
</p>
<p>sometimes conceived in the following terms : " Si vales, gaudeo ;
</p>
<p>ego valco" and frequently written in the initials only, S. V. G. E.
</p>
<p>V. or S V. B. E. E. V. that is, " Si vales, bene est, ego valeo." The
</p>
<p>tetter frequently ended with the word " Vale" sometimes " Ave,"
</p>
<p>or " Salve," to which, in some instances, was added the expression
</p>
<p>of endearment, " Mi anime." The place where the letter was
</p>
<p>written was subjoined, unless previously communicated. The date
</p>
<p>always expressed the day, frequently the year, and sometimes the
</p>
<p>hour. They used no signature, or subscription, unless when writ
</p>
<p>ing to emperors. There was very rarely an inscription on the out-
</p>
<p>side, the letter being delivered to a letter-carrier, (Tabellarius,) who
</p>
<p>was made acquainted with the person for whom it was intended.
</p>
<p>The letter was tied round with a string, the knot of which was
</p>
<p>sealed. The seal was, generally, a head of the letter-writer, or of
</p>
<p>some of his ancestors, impressed on wax or chalk. Hence the
</p>
<p>phrases for " to open a letter," are "vinculum solvere" li incidere
</p>
<p>linum" " epistolam solvere." It was usual also for the bearer of
</p>
<p>the letter, before it was opened, to request the person to examine
</p>
<p>the seal, that he might be sure there was no imposture. Crombie's

<p>2. Egregia tua fides, &c. " Your distinguished integrity, known

<p>to me by experience, has given a pleasing confidence to my present
</p>
<p>recommendation," i. e. has inspired me with a pleasing confidence
</p>
<p>in recommending my concerns to your care.
</p>
<p>3. Quamobrem defensionem, &c. Defensio is here opposed to
</p>
<p>satisf actio, and signifies a formal defence in the presence of one's
</p>
<p>enemies, while satisfaclio denotes a general explanation, such as
</p>
<p>may satisfy a friend. The whole passage may hence be rendered
</p>
<p>is follows : " Wherefore, as regards the novel step which I have
</p>

</p>
<p>Q*y taken, I have resolved not to prepare a formal defence of it agains*
</p>
<p>my enemies, but, without any consciousness of misconduct, have
</p>
<p>determined to lay before you such an explanation as may remove
</p>
<p>the doubts of a friend.' , The phrase u ex nulla conscitntia de
</p>
<p>culpa," Burnouf considers a remnant of earlier Latinity, when to
</p>
<p>preposition, as in our modern tongues, was used to identify indi-
</p>
<p>vidual cases, de culpa being here equivalent to culpae. We doubt
</p>
<p>the correctness of this explanation. The preposition appears to be
</p>
<p>here used with the ablative for the purpose of expressing the
</p>
<p>slightest possible relation between conscieniia and culpa in the mind
</p>
<p>of the writer.
</p>
<p>4. Quam. Referring to satis j 'actionem.
</p>
<p>5. Me dius fidius, &c. " Which, upon my honour as a man,
</p>
<p>you will find to be true." As regards the expression dius fidius,
</p>
<p>Festus makes it the same as Aiog filius, " the son of Jove," i. e.
</p>
<p>Hercules. He states, at the same time, two other explanations ;
</p>
<p>one, which makes it equivalent to divi fides, and the other to diet
</p>
<p>fides. All these etymologies are decidedly erroneous. A passage
</p>
<p>in Plautus, (Asin. I, 1, 8,) furnishes a safer guide. It is as follows :
</p>
<p>"Per deumfidium quaeris ; jurato mihi video necesse esse eloqui,
</p>
<p>quidquid roges." From this passage we may fairly infer, that, in
</p>
<p>the phrase under consideration, dius is the same as deus or divus,
</p>
<p>and fidius an adjective formed from. fides. Hence dius fidius, "the
</p>
<p>god of honour," or "good faith," will be the same as the 'Zevg
</p>
<p>viartog of the Greeks ; and, if we follow the authority of Varro, (L. L.
</p>
<p>4, 10,) identical with the Sabine Sancus, and Roman Hercules : so
</p>
<p>that me dius fidius is nothing more than me deus fidei (i. e. Hercules)
</p>
<p>adjuvet, or, in other words, mehercule.
</p>
<p>6. Fructu laboris. Alluding to the consulship, which he had
</p>
<p>sought ineffectually.
</p>
<p>7. Statum dignitatis. a That station in the republic to which I
</p>
<p>was fairly entitled." Compare ch. 18, " Post paullo Catilina, pccu~
</p>
<p>niarum repetundarum reus, prohibitus erat consulatum petere," &c.

<p>8. Meis nominibus. " Of my own contracting."  Alienisnomi-
</p>
<p>nibus. " Contracted by others, and for which I had become surety."
</p>
<p>Among the Romans, it was a customary formality, in borrowing
</p>
<p>money, to write down the sum and subscribe the person's name in
</p>
<p>the banker's books. Hence nomen is put for a debt, for the cause
</p>
<p>of a debt, for an article of account, &c.

</p>
<p>fconour ;" i. e. raised to high preferment.

</p>
<p>hrough groundless suspicion."

<p>11. Hoc nomine, &c. " On this account I have pursued a course Q^f
</p>
<p>Bufficiently honourable, considering my calamitous situation, and
</p>
<p>,one which leads me to entertain the hope of preserving what con
</p>
<p>sideration there is left me."
</p>
<p>12. Earn ab injuria defendas, &c. "Defend her from injury,
</p>
<p>being intreated so to do by the love you bear to your own off-
</p>
<p>spring. "
</p>
<p>13. Haveto. An archaism for Aveto. Catullus uses this form
</p>
<p>(101, 10,) "Have atque Vale." Compare Quintilian, 1, 6, 21, ed.
</p>
<p>Spalding Whiter' s etymology of the word is extremely ingenious :
</p>
<p>" Have or Ave is nothing but Habe, have, possess  riches, honours,
</p>
<p>health."
</p>
<p>14. In agro Arretino. The common text has Reatino. As
</p>
<p>Reate, however, was a town of the Sabines, and as Catiline was
</p>
<p>proceeding along the Aurelian way, under the pretence of retiring to
</p>
<p>Massilia, but in reality to join Manlius, it is far preferable to adopt
</p>
<p>Arretino as the lection, Arretium (now Arezzo) being an ancient
</p>
<p>city of Etruria.
</p>
<p>15. Sine fraude. " With impunity," or " with the assurance of
</p>
<p>safety." Compare the w T ords of Ulpian, Cleg. 131, de V. S.) " Aliud
</p>
<p>fraus est, aliud poena. Fraus enim sine poena esse potest : poena
</p>
<p>sine fraude esse non potest. Poena est noxae vindicta; fraus e*
</p>
<p>ipsa noxa dicitur, et quasi poenae quaedam praeparatio."
</p>
<p>16. Praeter condemnatis. In this clause, condemnahs
</p>
<p>depends on liceret, and praeter is used adverbially for praeter quam.
</p>
<p>The instances, however, of such a usage are not of very frequent
</p>
<p>occurrence. We have one in Justin, (13, 5,) " Alexander cpistolas
</p>
<p>in Graeciam scripserat, quibus omnium civitatum exules, praeter
</p>
<p>coedis damnati, restituebantur." (Vid. Graev. ad loc.) Another
</p>
<p>example is found in Suetonius, though not so conclusive as the first :
</p>
<p>" reliquerit eum nullo, praeter augur alis sacerdotii, honore imperti
</p>
<p>turn." {Claud. 4.  vol. 2, page 10. ed. Cms.)

</p>
<p>There is here an ellipsis offactis. The first of these ordinances is

<p>mentioned in chapter 30.
</p>
<p>1. Tmta vis morbi, uti tabes. " So violent a malady, like some 98
</p>
<p>corroding poison," &c. The distemper or malady, here alluded
</p>
<p>to, is the desire of a change, which influenced, at that period, the
</p>
<p>minds of so large a number, and produced a disaffection to the
</p>
<p>state.

<p>Qg 3. Quzs opes nullae sunt. " They, who nave no resources of
</p>
<p>their own, look with an evil eye on the higher class of citizens,
</p>
<p>elevate to office those who are of the same stamp with themselves. "
</p>
<p>Quis is put for quibus. By bonos are here meant, not the good and
</p>
<p>virtuous merely, but, generally speaking, the better class of citizens
</p>
<p>who are always more or less averse to violent changes in the state,
</p>
<p>as well from principle, as from the danger which might result to
</p>
<p>their private affairs. By malos, on the other hand, are meant the
</p>
<p>needy and unprincipled. Compare Plautus, (Captiv. 3, 4, 51,)
</p>
<p>" Est miserorum ut malevolentes sint atque invideant bonis. "
</p>
<p>4. Turba. " By public disturbance."  Sine cura. " Without
</p>
<p>any apprehension for themselves."  Habetur. "Is kept," or
</p>
<p>" exists." The idea expressed in the text, when paraphrased, will
</p>
<p>be, " since poverty does not easily suffer loss."
</p>
<p>5. Plebes. To be construed as the nominative absolute. Some edi-
</p>
<p>tions read a vero, instead of ea vero 1 removing at the same time the
</p>
<p>comma after plebes, which of course alters the construction. This
</p>
<p>emendation, however, is far inferior to the reading in our text. From
</p>
<p>a view of the context it will appear, that Sallust first speaks of the
</p>
<p>people in general, the people of the whole empire, (cuncta plebes
</p>
<p>omnino.) He then particularizes the people of the capital, and remarks,
</p>
<p>that, with regard to them, there were other and more special reasons,
</p>
<p>the operation of which led them to favour the designs of Catiline.

</p>
<p>Lepidus, as given by Sallust, (Hist. frag. lib. 1, p. 936, ed. CorL)
</p>
<p>About twenty years after this event, a powerful effort was made by
</p>
<p>ihe individuals who were suffering under the operation of this law,
</p>
<p>to have it repealed. Cicero was at that time consul, and by his
</p>
<p>strenuous exertions defeated the application. Of the oration de-
</p>
<p>livered by him on this occasion, (De proscriptorum liberis,) a
</p>
<p>solitary fragment is preserved by Qumtilian, (11, 1,) " Quid emm
</p>
<p>crudelius quam homines honestis parentibus ac majoribus natos a
</p>
<p>republica submoveri? Sed ita legibus Syllae continetur status
</p>
<p>civitatis, ut, his solutis, stare ipsa non possit." (Cic. Op. ed
</p>
<p>Olivet, vol. 6, p. 479.) Cicero himself alludes to his conduct in
</p>
<p>this affair, in his oration against Piso, (chap. 2.) He allowed the
</p>
<p>claim to be perfectly reasonable, but argued against it on the ground
</p>
<p>of state-policy. Julius Caesar, however, subsequently abrogated
</p>
<p>this unjust ordinance. Thus Suetonius, (Jul. 41,) remarks, u Ad-

</p>
<p>15. Tribunicia potestas restituta. The tribunes of the commons
</p>
<p>were originally created A. U. C. 260, at the time of the secession
</p>
<p>to the sacred mount, for the purpose of protecting the rights of the
</p>
<p>people. Under the sanction, however, of the law which made their
</p>
<p>persons sacred, they subsequently carried their power to the most
</p>
<p>extravagant height. Sylla abridged, and in a manner extinguished,
</p>
<p>that power, by enacting, that whoever had been tribune should not
</p>
<p>260 NOTES TO THE

<p>Page,
</p>
<p>Qg afterwards enjoy any other magistracy ; that there should be no
</p>
<p>appeal to the tribunes ; that they should not be allowed to assemble -
</p>
<p>the people and make harangues to them, nor propose laws, but
</p>
<p>should only retain the right of intercession. In the consulship of
</p>
<p>Cotta, however, (A. U. C. 679,) they again obtained the right of
</p>
<p>enjoying other offices ; and in that of Pompey and Crassus, A. U.
</p>
<p>C. 683, all their former powers. Pompey's conduct in this affair is
</p>
<p>very justly condemned by Cicero, since the tribunes now became
</p>
<p>mere tools in the hands of the ambitious and powerful.
</p>
<p>16. Summam potestatem nacti. These words have very much
</p>
<p>the appearance of an interpolation. They are not necessary to the
</p>
<p>sense, since by summam potestatem is meant the tribunician power,
</p>
<p>which has already been mentioned in the preceding clause.
</p>
<p>99 1- Senati specie, &c. "Under the pretence of supporting the
</p>
<p>authority of the senate, but in reality for their own advancement."
</p>
<p>2. Honestis nominibus. " Under fair pretexts."
</p>
<p>3. Neque modestia neque modus. "Neither moderation nor limit."
</p>
<p>4. Maritimum. The maritime war against the Cilicians, sup-
</p>
<p>ported by Mithridates, called also the piratical war. The Cilician
</p>
<p>pirates, covered every sea with their fleets, and extended their dep-
</p>
<p>redations even to the coast of Italy and the mouth of the Tiber
</p>
<p>Pompey was sent against them, by virtue of the Gabinian law, A
</p>
<p>U. C. 687, and brought the war to a conclusion within the space of
</p>
<p>forty days. Compare Veil. Paterc. 2, 31 et 32 : Floras, 3, 6 : Cic.
</p>

</p>
<p>5. Mithridaticum. The war with Mithridates, king of Pontus,
</p>
<p>one of the ablest monarchs with whom the Romans ever had to con-
</p>
<p>tend. His character is briefly but ably drawn by Velleius Pater-
</p>
<p>culus, (2, 18, ],) " Vir neque silendus, neque dicendus sine cura,
</p>
<p>hello acerrimus, mrtute eximius, aliquando fortuna, semper ammo
</p>
<p>maximus, consiliis dux, miles manu, odio in Romanos Hannibal."

<p>the expiration of which period he was recalled by the senate, and

<p>Pompey, who had just ended the piratical war, was, by the Manilian
</p>
<p>Law, sent against Mithridates.
</p>
<p>6. Plebis opes imminutae. The authority of the people was
</p>
<p>weakened by the high powers delegated to a single individual,
</p>
<p>Pompey.
</p>
<p>7. Innoxii. The adjective is here used passively, "unhurt," or,
</p>
<p>less literally, " free from all danger of attack." Compare Lucan,
</p>
<p>(9,894.)
</p>
<p>8. Ceteros judiciis terrere. " They alarmed the res; by the
</p>
<p>rigcui of their judicial investigations."

</p>
<p>9. Placidius. " More peaceably." The meaning of the clause J)G
</p>
<p>.a, that those who filled offices of magistracy, especially the tri-
</p>
<p>buneship, might be less disposed to stir up commotions among
</p>
<p>the people, through dread of prosecution by the nobility, after the
</p>
<p>expiration of their offices.
</p>
<p>10. Ubi primum, &c. Gruter suggests novandi, which Cortius
</p>
<p>acknowledges would make an easier construction, though it would
</p>
<p>be less in accordance with the style of Sallust, than the present
</p>
<p>reading ?iovandis. Some editions adopt Gruter's suggestion of
</p>
<p>novandi, and place a comma after primum, and another after rebus.
</p>
<p>We have given the reading of Cortius, which may be rendered as
</p>
<p>follows : " As soon as the hope was presented to their view of
</p>
<p>effecting some change in the adverse condition of their affairs."
</p>
<p>11. Vetus certamen. " The old controversy," i. e. between the
</p>
<p>patricians and plebeians.  Eorv,m. Referring to the plebeians.
</p>
<p>12. Aequo, manu, &c. " Had left the field on equal terms with
</p>
<p>the forces of the republic."
</p>
<p>13. Exsanguibus. " Completely exhausted." Compare Cicero,
</p>
<p>{pro Sext. 10,) " Hominibus enervatis atque exsanguibus consu-
</p>
<p>latus ..... datus est."
</p>
<p>14. Extra conjurationem. "Unconnected with the conspiracy."
</p>
<p>15. A. Fulvius. As Valerius Maximus, (5, 8, 5,) in mentioning
</p>
<p>this same circumstance, calls the name of the father A. Fulvius,
</p>
<p>Cortius thinks it probable that Sallust wrote A. Fulvii senatoris
</p>
<p>filius. Dio Cassius (37, 36) incorrectly makes the son himself a
</p>
<p>8enator : ' AJjXov Si <DoiiA/?iov, avSpa fiovXevrrjv, avros h TraTfjp d-rriafya^ev.
</p>
<p>(Vid. Reimar. ad loc.)

<p>16. Parens necari jussit. Fathers, among the Romans, had the
</p>
<p>power of life and death over their children. Hence a father is called
</p>
<p>a domestic judge or magistrate, by Seneca ; and a censor of his
</p>
<p>son, by Suetonius, (Vit. Claud. 16.) Valerius Maximus, (1. c.) in
</p>
<p>relating this affair of the punishment of Fulvius, adds, that the

<p>jountry, but for his country against Catiline. " Non se Catilinae
</p>
<p>dlum adversus patriam, sed patriae, adversus Catilinam, genuisse."
</p>
<p>17. Negotiatus. Understand erat. " Had traded." For the
</p>
<p>difference between the Roman negotiatores and "nercatores, consult
</p>
<p>note 7, page 44.
</p>
<p>18. Principibus. " Leading men."  Noverat. Noscere is " to
</p>
<p>know," or " to be acquainted with any thing as an object of per-
</p>
<p>ception ;" " to have an idea" or " notion of it, as apprehended by
</p>
<p>the mind " Scire is "to know any thing as a matter of fact, or
</p>
<p>any tnth as an object of convictidn. ,, The following examples will
</p>
<p>262 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>QQ explain this difference more fully : kl Hominem ,iovi, cc dunLiii<<s qui
</p>
<p>nunc est scio" (Plant. Rud. 4, 3, 26,) " I am acquainted with
</p>
<p>the man, and I know who his master is." The latter clause, how-
</p>
<p>ever, does not imply any personal knowledge of the master. He
</p>
<p>might know him only by name. " Non norunt, scio" (Plaut. Cos
</p>
<p>Prol.) " They are not acquainted with the play," not having see*
</p>
<p>it performed  " this circumstance I know." (Crombie's Gymna
</p>
<p>stum, vol. 1, p. 82.)
</p>
<p>19. Percunctatus. Percunctari (or percontari) means " to sif
</p>
<p>to the bottom by search or inquiry," " to pry," and has, according
</p>
<p>to Dumesnil, a relation very often to public news. It is derived
</p>
<p>probably from per and contus, (quasi per contum exquirere^) and ex-
</p>
<p>presses a sifting and inquisitive manner of asking. Percunctari,
</p>
<p>moreover, answers to the Greek irwQdvcaBai, and always requires a
</p>
<p>detailed reply.
</p>
<p>100 * Videt. This verb is here used instead of audit. Compare
</p>
<p>Cicero, {pro Arch. 8,) " Quoties ego hunc Archiam vidi ...
</p>
<p>dicer e ex tempore."
</p>
<p>2. Si modo, &c. " Provided only you are inclined to act the
</p>
<p>part of men."
</p>
<p>3. Quin. In the sense of quod non, which is the reading of some
</p>
<p>editions.
</p>
<p>4. A b Roma aberat. This is one of the examples which Priscian
</p>
<p>adduces, for the purpose of showing, that the preposition is often,
</p>
<p>more especially by historians, added to the ablative of names of
</p>
<p>places.
</p>
<p>5. Quo major auctoritas, &c. " That what he should say might
</p>
<p>have greater weight."
</p>
<p>6. Innoxios. " Innocent persons ;" i. e. individuals unconnected
</p>
<p>with the conspiracy. The adjective is here used in what the gram-
</p>
<p>marians call an active sense. Compare note 7, page 99.  Quo
</p>
<p>legatis animus amplior esset. " That the ambassadors might be
</p>
<p>inspired with more courage to act."

<p>7. Major -es opes. " More powerful resources ;" those namely
</p>
<p>of the republic. Dureau de Lamalle renders the phrase by " une
</p>
<p>grande masse de puissance."
</p>
<p>8. Patrocinio. Individual noblemen, or particular families of
</p>
<p>illustrious rank, were sometimes patrons of whole states. These
</p>
<p>patrons were generally those who had reduced them under the Ro-
</p>
<p>man power, or had, at some time or other, been appointed governors
</p>
<p>over them : and the rights of patronage were transmitted by them to
</p>
<p>their descendants. In the present instance, Q. Fabius Sanga derived
</p>
<p>his right cf patronage from his - ancestor Q. Fabius Maximum who
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE. 263
</p>

</p>
<p>finally reduced the Allobroges, and hence was surnamed Allobro- J 00
</p>
<p>gicus.
</p>
<p>9. Consilio cognito. " Having learned the plot."  Studium con~
</p>
<p>jurationis, &c. " To feign a strong desire for the success of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy."
</p>
<p>10. Bene polliceantur. " To promise fair." Bene is here equiv
</p>
<p>alent to bona quaeque.
</p>
<p>11. Gallia citeriore. Hither or Cisalpine Gaul, lying south of
</p>
<p>the Alps, and forming the northern division of Italy. The term
</p>
<p>exterior is applied in reference to Rome.
</p>
<p>12. Cuncta simul agere. " Put all their schemes in operation at
</p>
<p>one and the same moment." Cortius wishes to exclude cuncta simul
</p>
<p>from the text, in opposition to all the manuscripts.
</p>
<p>13. Festinando, agitando omnia. " By their precipitate move-
</p>
<p>ments, by their thro-nng all things into confusion."
</p>
<p>1. C. Murena. Brother of Licinius Murena, consul elect. The ini
</p>
<p>common reading in citeriore Gallia has been amended by Cortius,
</p>
<p>and in ulteriore Gallia substituted. There can be no doubt what
</p>
<p>ever as to the correctness of this alteration. Celer was in hither -
</p>
<p>Gaul, and Murena, as appears plainly from Cicero, (pro Murena, 410
</p>
<p>was in Transalpine or farther Gaul.
</p>
<p>2. Legatus. A proconsul or propraetor chose a legatus to ac-
</p>
<p>company him to his province, and assist him in the discharge of his
</p>
<p>public duties. Thus Cicero, for example, when he went as pro-
</p>
<p>consul into Cilicia, A. U. C. 702, chose for his legatus his brother
</p>
<p>Quintus. In the absence of the governor of the province, the
</p>
<p>legatus exercised full control over it, and had equal authority and
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. Sometimes the governor remained at home, and
</p>
<p>merely sent out the legatus to the province ; and at other times
</p>
<p>the senate, without naming any proconsul or propraetor, merely
</p>
<p>sent out a legatus. This last was the case with C. Murena.
</p>
<p>3. Videbantur. Understand illae, referring to copiae.
</p>
<p>4. Constituerant. The verb is put in the plural, as if Lentulus

<p>cum ceteris were a double nominative.
</p>
<p>5. Actionibus. " The proceedings," " the acts." Alluding to
</p>
<p>Ciceco's having driven Catiline from the city, and excited, as they
</p>
<p>maintained, the most groundless suspicions against many innocent
</p>
<p>individuals. Compare Appian, (B. C. 2, 3,) AcOkiov SI Bq^nar,

</p>

</p>
<p>101 a ^ ew ^ a y s ^ e ^ ore tnat f Cicero expired, would not suffer him tt
</p>
<p>address the people. They placed their own benches on the rostra,
</p>
<p>and only gave him permission to take the oath upon laying
</p>
<p>down his office, after which he was immediately to descend. Ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly, when Cicero went up, it was expected that he would
</p>
<p>take the customary oath ; but, silence being made, instead of the
</p>
<p>usual form, he adopted one that was new and singular. The pur
</p>
<p>port of it was, that " He had saved his country, and pieserved the
</p>
<p>empire :" (jj p/v oecoiKwai rt]v TrarpiSa^ kcu StaTSTrjprjKsvai rr\v fiyefioviav.)
</p>
<p>and all the people joined in it.
</p>
<p>6. Invidiam. " The blame."  Optumo consuli. Some have
</p>
<p>regarded this expression on the part of the historian as extremely
</p>
<p>honourable, considering the private feud which existed between him
</p>
<p>and Cicero. We should be inclined to put a different construction
</p>
<p>upon it. Nothing appears to us more frigid than this language of
</p>
<p>Sallust respecting one who had been the preserver of his country.
</p>
<p>And that it would sound so in fact to a Roman ear, may be clearly
</p>
<p>inferred from a passage in one of the letters of Cicero to Atticus,
</p>
<p>(12, 21,) in which he speaks of Brutus having applied this same
</p>
<p>expression to him : "Hie autem se etiam tribuere multum mifa
</p>
<p>putat, quod scripserit optimum consulem. Quis enim jejunius dixit
</p>
<p>inimicus V
</p>
<p>7. Proxuma node. Plutarch states, that one of the nights of the
</p>
<p>Saturnalia had been fixed for the perpetration of the horrid deeds
</p>
<p>mentioned in the text. The testimony of Cicero is to the same
</p>
<p>effect, (3, in Cat 4.) The celebration of the Saturnalia commenced
</p>
<p>on the 17th day of December, so that Bestia was to have delivered
</p>
<p>his intended harangue a few days after he had entered upon his
</p>
<p>office, which, in the case of the tribunes, was the 10th of the same
</p>
<p>month. On the 5th of December, however, the conspirators were
</p>
<p>"ut to death.
</p>
<p>8. Duodecim simul opportuna, &c. Plutarch's statement differs
</p>
<p>from that of Sallust. He informs us that the conspirators had

</p>
<p>divided Rome into a hundred parts, and selected the same number
</p>
<p>of men, to each of whom was allotted his quarter to be set on fire
</p>
<p>As this was to be done by them all at the same moment, they
</p>
<p>hoped that the conflagration would be general. Others were to
</p>
<p>intercept the water, and kill all that went to seek it.
</p>
<p>9. Obsideret. " Should beset." A verb of the third conjuga-
</p>
<p>tion, obsido, ere.
</p>
<p>10. Alius autem alium. Understand adgrederetur. " That one
</p>
<p>should attack one, another attack another :" i. e. that each should
</p>
<p>single out his victim.

<p>11. Filii familiarum. To these Cicero is thought to allude, JO J
</p>
<p>(2, in Cat. 3,) M Hos, quos video volitare injoro, quos stare ad
</p>
<p>curiam, quos etiam in senatum venire, qui nitent unguentis, qui
</p>
<p>fulgent purpura" &c.
</p>
<p>12. Parata. Plutarch states, that Cains Sulpicius, one of the
</p>
<p>praetors, who had been sent to Cethegus's house, found there a
</p>
<p>large quantity of javelins, swords, poniards, and other arms, all newly
</p>
<p>fuibished.
</p>
<p>13. Dies prolatando. " By putting off the day of execution."
</p>
<p>14. Conveniunt. " Obtain an interview with." The following
</p>
<p>examples, with reference to the construction of convenio, may not
</p>
<p>be misplaced. Convenire in urban. " To come into the city and
</p>
<p>assemble." Convenire in urbe. " To assemble in the city, having
</p>
<p>been there before." Convenire aliquem. " To speak to anyone,"
</p>
<p>or " to have an interview with him." Convenit hoc mihi. " This
</p>
<p>suits me," or, " is convenient to me." Convenit mihi cum illo. " I
</p>
<p>agree with him."
</p>
<p>15. Jusjurandum. " An oath :" i. e. a written promise in the
</p>
<p>language and form of an oath, that the conspirators would afford
</p>
<p>relief to the Allobroges, if the latter joined in the plot and it should
</p>
<p>prove successful.
</p>
<p>16. Signatum. "With their respective seals affixed."
</p>
<p>17. Ceteri nihil suspicantes dant. Compare Cicero, (3, in Cat.
</p>
<p>5,) " Tabulas proferri jussimus, quae a quoque dicebantur datae.

<p>it may not be amiss to state that Cicero gives it somewhat differ-
</p>
<p>ently, (3, in Cat. 5.) It is more than probable, however, that the

<p>orator merely stated the purport of it from memory, while Sallust
</p>
<p>had access to the original among the archives of the state : for the

<p>words of the historian (quarum exemplum infra scrijituni) plainly

</p>
<p>men of military experience."

</p>
<p>Gruter all three words. They are retained, however, and on good
</p>
<p>grounds, by Cortius, Burnouf, Planche, &c. Gruter thinks, that,
</p>
<p>as the Gauls informed the consul of the night when they were to
</p>
<p>set out, they must of course have known that they would be arrested.
</p>
<p>This may all very well be, and yet the presence of cito in the text,
</p>
<p>as well as of cognito consilio, is perfectly proper. The Gauls in an
</p>
<p>instant understood the nature of the affair, being previously con-
</p>
<p>vinced that an arrest would take place. Had Sallust, moreover,
</p>
<p>only written cognito consilio, the inquiry would naturally be made
</p>
<p>by the reader, whether the consul's plan was then for the first time
</p>
<p>discovered by them, or whether they had surmised what it would be,

</p>
<p>King of Rome, nine books of the Sibylline, or prophetic oracles, bu*;
</p>
<p>at an exorbitant price ; which Tarquin refusing, she burnt three of
</p>
<p>them, still demanding the same price for the remaining six. Being
</p>
<p>ridiculed by the king, she burnt three more, without abating her
</p>
<p>price for the remaining three. Tarquin, surprised at her strange
</p>
<p>conduct, consulted the augurs, who, regretting the loss of the book*
</p>
<p>which had been burnt, advised the king to pay her demand, on de
</p>
<p>livery of the three remaining lxoks. Two persons at first, then ten

<p>hence called Quindecimviri. These books were supposed to contain

<p>the fate of the republic, and in time of public danger or calamity

<p>were consulted by order of the senate. They of course became a

<p>105 ^' Antea. Underst and fuisse, or else regnum habuisse.
</p>
<p>7. Urbis potiri. The verb potiri, which elsewhere governs an
</p>
<p>ablative, is often, as in the present instance, used with a genitive.
</p>
<p>This government, liowever, admits of a very easy explanation, if we
</p>
<p>consider that potiri is in fact equivalent to potens esse or potentem
</p>
<p>esse. In Plautus we even find the active of this verb. (Amph. 1,
</p>
<p>1, 23,) " Quifuerim liber, eum nunc potivit pater servitutis ;" i. e.
</p>
<p>~nas put in slavery," "has made partaker of slavery ;" thence
</p>
<p>votior is used passively ; e. g. " potitus est hostium," {ibid. Capt. 1,
</p>
<p>2, 41,) " he is mastered by the enemy," " is in the enemy's power."
</p>
<p>8. Jncenso Capitolio. The Capitol was thrice destroyed by fire.
</p>
<p>First, during the troubles occasioned by the contest between Sylla
</p>
<p>and Marius, A. U. C. 670, after which it was rebuilt by Sylla, and
</p>
<p>dedicated by Catulus. It is to this burning that the text refers. It
</p>
<p>was a second time destroyed, A. D. 70, by the soldiers of Vitellius.
</p>
<p>The emperor Vespasian rebuilt it, and at his death it was burnt ?
</p>
<p>third time. Domitian restored it with greater magnificence rlian
</p>
<p>ever.
</p>
<p>9. Haruspices. The haruspices were those who examined the
</p>
<p>victims and their entrails after they were sacrificed, and from these
</p>
<p>derived omens of futurity. They pretended to divine also from the
</p>
<p>flame, smoke, and other circumstances attending the sacrifice. Do-
</p>
<p>natus (in Ter. Phorm. 4, 4, 28) derives the name from haruga,
</p>
<p>" a victim," observing, " nam haruga dicitur hostia, ab hara in qua
</p>
<p>concluditur et servatur : hara autem est, in qua pecora includuntur."
</p>
<p>Compare Cicero, (3 in Cat. 8,) in relation to what is stated in the
</p>
<p>text. " Quo quidem tempore, cum haruspices ex tota Etruria con-
</p>
<p>venissent, caedes atque incendia, et legum interitum, et bellum civile
</p>
<p>ac domesticum, et toiius urbis atque imperii occasum appropinquare
</p>
<p>dixcvunt, nisi dii immoi tales omni ratione placati suo numine prope
</p>
<p>fata ipsa jlexissent." The orator adds, that games were in conse-
</p>
<p>quence celebrated for ten days, and every other formality observed
</p>
<p>for appeasing the wrath of the gods.

<p>10. Abdicatus. Others read abdicato magistratu : both forms
</p>
<p>are in accordance with the idiom of the language, only the former,
</p>
<p>which is that adopted by Cortius, shows more plainly that his office
</p>
<p>was taken from Lentulus, not voluntarily resigned by him.
</p>
<p>11. Libcris custodiis. "In free custody," equivalent to our
</p>
<p>phrase, of "being held to bail." This was done either when the
</p>
<p>accused were persons of rank, or when they were many in number,
</p>
<p>and were separated so as to prevent any communication with one
</p>
<p>another.

</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE. 269

<p>Page,
</p>
<p>curule. Two plebeian aediles were first created, A. U. C. 260, in J03
</p>
<p>the Comitia Curiata, at the same time with the tribunes of the
</p>
<p>commons, to be, as it were, their assistants, and to determine cer-
</p>
<p>tain minor causes, which the tribunes committed to them. They
</p>
<p>were afterwards created, as the other inferior magistrates, at the
</p>
<p>Comitia Tributa. Two curule aediles w T ere created from the
</p>
<p>patricians, A. U. C. 387, to perform certain public games. They
</p>
<p>were first chosen alternately from the patricians and plebeians, but
</p>
<p>afterwards promiscuously from both. They wore the toga praetexta,
</p>
<p>had the right of images, and a more honourable place of giving their
</p>
<p>opinion in the senate. They also used the sella curulis, whence
</p>
<p>their name of curule aediles. As a counterbalance for all this,
</p>
<p>however, the persons of the plebeian aediles were sacred, like those
</p>
<p>of the tribunes. The general office of the aediles was to take care
</p>
<p>of the city, (hence their name a cur a aedium,) to regulate the
</p>
<p>markets, inspect the weights and measures, &c.
</p>
<p>13. C. Caesari. The famous Julius Caesar, who was at this
</p>
<p>time praetor elect. It was excellent policy to entrust some of the
</p>
<p>conspirators to the care of Caesar and Crassus, who were suspected
</p>
<p>of being themselves concerned in the plot. By pretending to re-
</p>
<p>gard them as good and faithful citizens, the senate drove them to
</p>
<p>the necessity of assuming that character at least.

</p>
<p>although it was towards the close of the day, delivered before the

<p>assembled people the oration which has come down to us as the
</p>
<p>third against Catiline. In this he gave an account of the arrest of the
</p>
<p>Allobroges, and the transactions in the senate. The people then
</p>
<p>perceived the full extent of the danger from which they had just been
</p>
<p>rescued by the energy and vigilance of their consul, and gave him

<p>the full meed of applause which he so richly deserved,

<p>of so much power seemed proper to be southed rather than irri-

</p>
<p>6. Obnoxii. " Under obligations to." Cortius correctly remarks,
</p>
<p>that plerique, in this clause, denotes a third class of persons, distinct
</p>
<p>from those to whom alii and pars respectively refer.  The great
</p>
<p>wealth of Crassus, and the numerous loans which it enabled him to
</p>
<p>make, had given him the most extensive private influence of any
</p>
<p>individual of the day.

</p>
<p>or tie ; in the plural, very frequently a prison, confinement, &c.
</p>
<p>9. Potestatem. Understand indicandi. " Permission to go on
</p>
<p>with his testimony." The refusal, on the part of the senate, to
</p>
<p>listen to his farther statements, was a virtual revoking of the pledge
</p>
<p>of impunity which they had previously granted him.
</p>
<p>10. Mentitus esset. The pronoun Qui is uniformly joined to the
</p>
<p>subjunctive mood, when the relative clause does not express any
</p>
<p>sentiment of the author, but refers it to the person or persons of
</p>
<p>whom he is speaking. Mentitus esset here implies the senate's
</p>
<p>affirmation, that Tarquinius had told a falsehood, and not the histo-
</p>
<p>rian's. The whole doctrine of the use of the relative with the sub-
</p>
<p>junctive, will be found clearly and ably developed in Crombie's

<p>finished the argument in favour of the defendant ; and that this
</p>
<p>promptness of his to assist any unfortunate citizen, gained him great

<p>popularity. He farther informs us, that there was not a Roman,

<p>however mean and insignificant, whom he did not salute, or whose
</p>
<p>salutation he did not return by name. ( Vit, Crass. 3, ed. Hutten

</p>
<p>it by some act of violence, had not his son Publius prevented him.

<p>Publius was a man of letters, and particularly fond of eloquence, 1 QA
</p>
<p>and hence his strong attachment to Cicero/' {Vit. Crass. 13, ed.

<p>Hutten, vol. 3, p. 421.)
</p>
<p>15. Pretio. " By the offer of a bribe."
</p>
<p>16. Nominaretur. " Should be named as an accomplice."
</p>
<p>Suetonius (Vit. Caes. 17) informs us, that Caesar was named as
</p>
<p>an accomplice the year after, by Curius in the senate, and by L.
</p>
<p>Vettius before Novius Nigrus the quaestor, (or, perhaps, public
</p>
<p>commissioner, if the true reading be quaesitorem, and not quaesto-
</p>
<p>rem, in the text of Suetonius.) Both accusations were dismissed.-

<p>reference to Rome : cujusdam Transpadani, "of a certain indi-
</p>
<p>vidual who dwelt beyond the Po," or, " north of the Po."
</p>
<p>19. Ex petitione pontificatus. "Ever sinee the time of his ap-
</p>
<p>plication for the high-priesthood." Plutarch, in his life of Caesar,
</p>
<p>informs us, that when Metellus, the chief pontiff, died, the office
</p>
<p>was solicited by Isauricus and Catulus, two of the most illustrious
</p>
<p>men in the city, and of the greatest interest in the senate. Caesar,
</p>
<p>nevertheless, did not shrink from the contest, but presented himself
</p>
<p>to the people as a candidate. The pretensions and prospects of the
</p>
<p>competitors seemed nearly equal ; and Catulus, who, on account of
</p>
<p>his superior dignity, was most uneasy about the event, sent privately
</p>
<p>to Caesar, and offered him large sums, on condition that he would
</p>
<p>desist from his high pursuit. But he answered, " He would rather
</p>
<p>borrow still larger sums, to enable him to stand the struggle."

<p>20. Adolescentulo. " A mere youth when compared with him-

<p>self." As Caesar was at this time thirty- seven years of age, it is
</p>
<p>evident the term adolescentulus is merely applied to him compara-
</p>
<p>tively, in reference to the advanced age of Catulus.

<p>refused it, either out of fear of the people, or because he thought

<p>such an assassination unlawful and unjust. If this was true," con-
</p>
<p>tinues Plutarch, " I know not why Cicero did not mention it in the

<p>history of his consulship. He was subsequently blamed, however,
</p>
<p>for not having availed himself of so good an opportunity as he then

</p>
<p>from the suspicions entertained of him, his defence was received

<p>manded Caesar, absolutely insisting on his being dismissed in
</p>
<p>safety." (Vit. Cues. 8, ed. Hutten. vol. 4, p. 367.) Suetonius
</p>
<p>(Vit. Caes. 14) informs us, that some of the knights threatened
</p>
<p>Caesar as he sat in the senate-house. It is probable that he and
</p>
<p>Sallust allude to different meetings.
</p>
<p>4. Minitarentur. The frequentative appears to be used in this
</p>
<p>passage, not so much for the sake of better sound, as in order to
</p>
<p>express the idea of a frequent brandishing of the sword, though it
</p>
<p>cannot be well conveyed in an English translation.
</p>
<p>5. Liberti. The Romans used the term libcrtus when they spoke
</p>
<p>of the master ; as, libertus Lentuli ; but libertinus, in relation to
</p>
<p>free-born citizens, as, libertinus homo, i. e. non ingenuus.
</p>
<p>6. Vicis. " The streets." Vicus, properly speaking, refers to
</p>
<p>the appearance presented by the buildings in a street ; a row of
</p>
<p>houses resembling, as it were, a single and extensive edifice.
</p>
<p>(o?kos, and, with the digamma, JPoiKog, whence vicus.) The term is
</p>
<p>used here, however, in the sense of via.
</p>
<p>7. Eripiendum. Understand e custodia. Cicero (4, in Cat. 8)
</p>
<p>states, that none were found who would engage in such an attempt.
</p>
<p>Appian, however, informs us, that on the nones of December, while
</p>
<p>the senate were deliberating about the punishment of the conspira
</p>
<p>tors, the slaves and freedmen of Lentulus and Cethegus, and a
</p>
<p>large body of working people, assailed the habitations of the praetors
</p>
<p>in the rear, and endeavoured to rescue the prisoners. Cicero, upon
</p>
<p>learning this, immediately left the senate, and planted guards in
</p>
<p>suitable quarters of the city, after which he returned and expedited
</p>
<p>the debate. (Appian, B. C. 2, 5.)
</p>
<p>8. Duces multitudinum. " The leaders of the mob." The want
</p>
<p>of trades and manufactures, which the Romans considered as em-
</p>
<p>ployments unworthy of freemen, left the great body of the inhabi-
</p>
<p>tants of Rome in a state of poverty and idleness, and ready for any
</p>
<p>desperate enterprise, to which they might be stimulated by artful

<p>demagogues.
</p>
<p>9. Familiam. Familia here denotes the " slaves" belonging to
</p>
<p>a family. This is the original signification of the word. It comes
</p>
<p>from famulus, " a servant," and this last from the old Oscan term
</p>
<p>famul, of the same import.
</p>
<p>10. Refert, &c. Literally, " Refers it to them, what it may please
</p>
<p>them be done to those," &c; i. e. " Consults their pleasure with
</p>
<p>respect to those," &c.
</p>
<p>11. Sed eos, paullo ante, &c. "Now a crowded house bad,
</p>
<p>a few days previous, declared them to have acted as enemies to

</p>
<p>105 theii country." This form of words, {contra r empullicam fecisse,}
</p>
<p>was always used against those who had been guilty of any treason-
</p>
<p>able or seditious conduct, and in cases where capital punishment
</p>
<p>most commonly ensued. Compare Cicero, pro Milone, 5 et 6.
</p>
<p>12. Turn D. Junius Silanus, &c. Turn refers to the present
</p>
<p>meeting of the senate, not to the previous one.  Decimus Junius
</p>
<p>Silanus had, as his colleague in the consulship, during the following
</p>
<p>year, L. Licinius Murena. He married Cato's half-sister, Servilia.
</p>
<p>Vid. Plutarch, Vit. Cat. min. c. 21.
</p>
<p>13. Consul designatus. " Consul elect." After A. U. C. 598,
</p>
<p>the consuls were chosen about the. end of July or the beginning of
</p>
<p>August, and entered on their office on the first day of January.
</p>
<p>During the interval they were styled Consules designati, and were
</p>
<p>always asked their opinions first in the senate. This interval was
</p>
<p>made so long, that they might have time to become acquainted with
</p>
<p>what pertained to their office ; and that inquiry might be made
</p>
<p>whether they had gained their election by bribery.
</p>
<p>14. Pedibus in sententiam, &c. " That he would embrace the
</p>
<p>opinion expressed by Tiberius Nero." The history of this whole
</p>
<p>affair appears to have been as follows : Silanus gave his opinion at
</p>
<p>first in favour of the severest punishment, {rovq avSpas lcrx^ T V xoXaaet
</p>
<p>[iSTicvai. Appian, B. C. 2, 5.) Many senators followed in the de-
</p>
<p>bate, and advocated the same course, (ttoXKoX avveridevTo. Appian,
</p>
<p>ubi supra.) When it came, however, to the turn of Tiberius Clau-
</p>
<p>dius Nero (grandfather of the future emperor) to deliver his senti-
</p>
<p>ments, he recommended that the conspirators should be detained in
</p>
<p>custody until Catiline was overcome, and that then the whole affair
</p>
<p>should be carefully investigated. Caesar, who was at this time
</p>
<p>praetor elect, spoke after Nero, and declared himself against capital
</p>
<p>punishment. The greater part of the senate, after he had finished,
</p>
<p>came over to his opinion, whereupon Cicero delivered his fourth
</p>
<p>Catilinarian oration, in which he took a view of the whole debate, and
</p>
<p>recommended prompt and vigorous measures. His efforts, however,

</p>
<p>were unsuccessful, and a large majority of the senators, and among
</p>
<p>them Cicero's own brother, Quintus, were disposed to side with
</p>
<p>Caesar, probably from the fear lest severer measures might provp
</p>
<p>injurious afterwards to Cicero himself. At last, Lutatius Catulus,
</p>
<p>Caesar's inveterate foe, and Cato, who was then tribune of the com-
</p>
<p>mons elect, interposed their efforts. The eloquence of the latter
</p>
<p>proved triumphant, and the course he recommended was almost
</p>
<p>unanimously adopted. (The authorities to be consulted on this
</p>
<p>subject are as follows : Plutarch, Vit. Cic. c. 20 et 21,  id. Vit
</p>
<p>Caes. c. 7 et 8,  id. Vit. Cat. min. c 22  Sueton Caes. 14

</p>
<p>Appian, B. C. 2, 5, seqq.) As regards the phrase, pedibus in 1Q^
</p>
<p>eenlentiam ire, which is given in the text, we may remark, that a
</p>
<p>decree of the senate was commonly made by a separation of th
</p>
<p>senators to different parts of the house. He who presided said,
</p>
<p>" Let those who are of such an opinion pass over to that side,"
</p>
<p>pointing to a certain quarter, l< and those who think differently, to
</p>
<p>this," Hence ire pedibus in sententiam alicujus means, " to agree
</p>
<p>to any one's opinion," since he who had first proposed the opinion, or
</p>
<p>who had been the principal speaker in favour of it, passed over first,
</p>
<p>and the rest followed.
</p>
<p>15. Sed Caesar. The speech which Sallust here assigns to
</p>
<p>Caesar, and which, from the term hujuscemodi, as used by the his-
</p>
<p>torian, must be regarded as Caesar's merely in its general and
</p>
<p>leading features, is a perfeet masterpiece of its kind : cool, argu-
</p>
<p>mentative, specious, and breathing apparently a spirit of patriotism,
</p>
<p>which was calculated to carry with it the opinions and feelings of a
</p>
<p>large majority of his hearers. It required all the bold and fervid
</p>
<p>eloquence of Cato to counteract its pernicious tendency.
</p>
<p>16. Ab odio, amicitia, &c. This construction of vacuus with
</p>
<p>the preposition, is not unusual in the best writers, such as Cicero,
</p>
<p>Tacitus, &c. Compare, in the 14th chapter of this same narrative,
</p>
<p>a culpa vacuus.
</p>
<p>17. Lubidini simul et usui paruit. "Has obeyed at the same
</p>
<p>time the dictates of passion and of interest."
</p>
<p>18. Ubi intenderis ingenium, &c. Understand in veram after
</p>
<p>nigenium. The passage may be paraphrased as follows : " When
</p>
<p>you apply the mind to the discovery of truth, unbiased by the influ-
</p>
<p>ence of any of these feelings, it succeeds in the search : if passion
</p>
<p>hold possession, it rules, and reason becomes useless."

</p>
<p>more to the dictates of resentment than to what your own character
</p>
<p>demands."
</p>
<p>9. Novum consilium. " The novel measure which has been
</p>
<p>proposed," viz. of putting citizens to death in violation of the laws.
</p>
<p>Cicero, however, (4, in Cat. 4,) says that Silanus had reminded the
</p>
<p>senate "hoc genus poenae saepe in improbos cives in republica esse
</p>
<p>usurpatum."
</p>
<p>10. Omnium ingenia exsuperat. " Transcends the imaginations
</p>
<p>of all."  lis. " Those forms of punishment." Understand poenis.

</p>
<p>favour of a mild infliction of punishment, from the very enormitv
</p>
<p>of the crime itself.

</p>
<p>fluous, as the crime speaks for itself, and cannot be aggravated by
</p>
<p>any powers of description. The true course for the senate to pursue
</p>
<p>is, according to him, to guard against any undue severity of punish-
</p>
<p>ment, both because it may expose them to the animadversion ol
</p>
<p>posterity, and may furnish those coming after them with a danger
</p>
<p>ous precedent. Hence he artfully urges the propriety of lemen'
</p>
<p>measures.

</p>
<p>tion there is the least freedom of action. In such a situation, t
</p>
<p>becomes us neither to show favour nor hatred, but, least of all,

</p>
<p> Eos mores, &c. " Such I know to be the principles, such the

<p>2. Injuria. " The nature of the crime," i. e. the enormity of the
</p>
<p>crime committed against the state.
</p>
<p>3. Praesenti diligentia. Used for praesentia et diligentia. "By
</p>
<p>the promptitude and diligence." Some manuscripts have praesertim
</p>
<p>diligentia.

<p>4. Tanta praesidia. These words appear to contain a secret

<p>censure of Cicero, as if it were at all necessary to have such power
</p>
<p>ful guards under arms in the very heart of the city.
</p>
<p>5. Ultra. " After this ;" i. e. beyond the grave. The doctrine
</p>
<p>advocated by Caesar in the text, and which corresponded so inti-
</p>
<p>mately with his life and actions, was one unhappily but too preva-
</p>
<p>lent in the ancient world. Cicero makes mention of this opinion of
</p>
<p>Caesar with regard to the soul, in his fourth oration against Cati
</p>
<p>line ; and Cato also alludes to it in the following speech.
</p>
<p>6. Lex Porcia. The Porcian Law, proposed by P. Porcius
</p>
<p>Laeca, a tribune of the commons, A. U. C. 454, ordained that no
</p>
<p>one should bind, scourge, or kill a Roman citizen, but that, in capi

<p>2. Damasippum. Damasippus was praetor during the consulship
</p>
<p>of Papirius Carbo and the younger Marius, A. U. C. 671. As a

<p>follower of the Marian party, he indulged in many cruel excesses

<p>7. Hanc ego caussam, &c. The train of reasoning which is here
</p>
<p>ascribed by the historian to Caesar, would appear to be as follows :
</p>
<p>Our forefathers, though they wanted neither sagacity in devising
</p>
<p>plans for their own advantage, nor boldness in carrying those plans
</p>
<p>into operation, yet never disdained to imitate, in the institutions of
</p>
<p>other nations, what they conceived to be of utility to themselves.
</p>
<p>Among other things, they borrowed the custom of inflicting capital
</p>
<p>punishment on condemned citizens. As, however, they had adopted
</p>
<p>this from the Greeks at a period when it promised to be productive
</p>
<p>of salutary effects, so they changed it for a different course when
</p>
<p>positive evil was found to result. This was their latest alteration,
</p>
<p>and it being such, we, their descendants, should be guided in this
</p>
<p>instance by their wisdom, and pursue without any deviation the path
</p>
<p>they have marked out for us, the more especially, as we acknow-
</p>
<p>ledge our inferiority to them in political foresight, and in the princi-
</p>
<p>ples of sound government.
</p>
<p>8. Profecio virtus, &c. " Surely there was greater energy and
</p>
<p>wisdom in those, who reared from trifling resources so mighty an
</p>
<p>empire," &c.
</p>
<p>9. Bene parta. " Happily obtained from them ;" i. e. " obtained,
</p>
<p>m an auspicious hour, from our fathers."
</p>
<p>1. Censeo. This, as has been already observed in the Notes on | r\^\
</p>
<p>the Jugurthine War, was the usual and formal word applied to the
</p>
<p>expression of his opinion on the part of a senator. Sed ita censeo
</p>
<p>must therefore be rendered, " But my opinion is this."
</p>
<p>2. Publicandas eorum pecunias. " That their property should
</p>
<p>oe confiscated."
</p>
<p>3. Per municipia. " Throughout the free towns."

</p>
<p>sult the senate in relation to their case, or treat, respecting them,
</p>
<p>with the people."
</p>
<p>5. Ceteri verbo, &c. " The rest gave merely a verbal assent,
</p>
<p>one to one of the speakers, another to another, in support of dif-
</p>
<p>ferent opinions."  Alii, i. e. Silano, Neroni, Caesari. When the

<p>senators gave merely a verbal assent to the opinion of any speaker,
</p>
<p>they retained their seats and exclaimed assentior, adding the name

<p>of the individual with whom they agreed ; as, assentior Silano

</p>
<p>17. Qui mihi atque animo meo, &c. Cortius considers mihi
</p>
<p>atque animo meo equivalent simply to meo animo. The meaning
</p>
<p>of the clause will then be :  " I, who never extended to my own
</p>
<p>self indulgence for any fault, was not easily induced to pardon the
</p>
<p>misdeeds of others, for the sake of gratifying their ruling propen-
</p>

</p>
<p>habit of pardoning, as expressed by the imperfect tense. Plutarch's
</p>
<p>biography of Cato will furnish an ample commentary on the words
</p>
<p>of the text. The stern and unbending character of this remarkable

<p>vou with no alarm. Your assertion is a false one ; for the condition

<p>of the state does inspire you with apprehensions, and those, too, of

<p>extremely severe. Some commentators suppose, that the allusion in

<p>the text is to his having taken part with Marius in the contest be-

</p>
<p>cised the least reflection ;" i. e. if they had not always been rash
</p>
<p>and inconsiderate in their actions. The irony is still continued : It
</p>
<p>was not from any hostile intent that they harboured these designs
</p>
<p>against their country. Oh ! no ; but from mere want of reflection.
</p>
<p>Their conduct has always been marked by inconsiderateness and
</p>
<p>haste.
</p>
<p>15. Neque parari, &c. Cato here hints that some of the senators
</p>
<p>were implicated, and betrayed the deliberations of the senate to the
</p>
<p>conspirators.

<p> -to 1. Manifestis. " Palpably guilty."
</p>
<p>2. Virtutem animi. " His firmness of soul."
</p>
<p>3. Sicuti Me censuerai. The decree of the senate is said to
</p>
<p>have been made in accordance with the opinion of Cato, not because
</p>
<p>he was the only one who spoke in favour of capital punishment, but
</p>
<p>because he advocated that measure with the most ability and zeal.
</p>
<p>Thus Cicero (Ep. ad. Att. 12, 21) remarks, " Cur ergo in senten-
</p>
<p>tiam Catonis 1 Quia verbis luculentioribus et pluribus rem eandem
</p>
<p>comprehenderat. ' '
</p>
<p>4. Sed mihi multa legend, &c. On the score of historical fidelity,
</p>
<p>Sallust is highly censurable for the silence which he preserves re-
</p>
<p>specting the public honours that were paid to Cicero on this occasion.
</p>
<p>" It is in the conclusion of the business," observes Mr. Dunlop,
</p>
<p>" that the historian withholds from Cicero his due share of applause,
</p>
<p>and contrives to eclipse him by always interposing the character of
</p>
<p>Cato ; though it could not be unknown to any witness of those
</p>
<p>transactions, that Cato himself, and other senators, publicly hailed
</p>
<p>the consul as the Father of his country, and that a thanksgiving to
</p>
<p>the gods was decreed in his name, for having preserved the city
</p>
<p>from conflagration and the citizens from massacre. This omission,
</p>
<p>which may have originated partly in enmity, and partly in disgust
</p>
<p>at the ill-disguised vanity of the consul, has in all times been re-
</p>

</p>
<p>departed." We have followed the Bipont text, with which that of

<p>8. Genus. " Birth." M. Porcius Cato, called, after liis death, 1 J2
</p>
<p>Uticensis, from the city of Utica, near Carthage, where he
</p>
<p>ended his existence, was the great grandson of M. Porcius Cato,
</p>
<p>the censor. The Porcian gens was plebeian ; the Julian, patrician ;
</p>
<p>i'iustrious achievements, however, and public honours, had raised
</p>
<p>the former to a full equality with the Vatter.

<p>11. Alia alii. " One kind of glory to the one, another to the

<p>other." The student will observe the use of alia alii in place of
</p>
<p>altera alteri, which last would be too limited in signification for the
</p>
<p>spirit of the passage. Compare Livy, 1, 21, " lta duo deinceps
</p>
<p>reges, alius alia via, Me bello, hie pace, civitatem auxerunty
</p>
<p>12. Huic severitas. " To the latter the rigid practice of virtue
</p>
<p>had imparted additional dignity."
</p>
<p>13. Ignoscendo. " By forgiving." Ignosco properly means to
</p>
<p>take no notice of a fault, (non nosse.) Thus Cicero, (Ep. ad Brut.

<p>15, a med.) " Sed sceleris poenam praetermittere (id enim est quod
</p>
<p>vocatur ignoscere) in hoc bello perniciosum puto."

<p>1. Tlliusfacilitas, hujus constantia, &c. " The yielding temper 1 IO
</p>
<p>of the former, the firmness of the latter, were subjects of continual

</p>
<p>criminals. They judged also concerning slaves, and persons ot the
</p>
<p>lowest rank. They were likewise called Tresviri or Treviri. From
</p>
<p>Valerius Maximus, (5, 4, 7,) it appears that they acted commonly
</p>
<p>by deputies.
</p>
<p>8. Locus  quod, &c. The relative here agrees in gender with
</p>
<p>the following noun. Some grammarians term this the Greek con-
</p>
<p>struction. It is the usual practice of Cicero ; but other authors give
</p>
<p>the relative the gender of the preceding noun : Cicero himsell adopts
</p>
<p>this latter custom when the word explained is a foreign one : as,
</p>
<p>" cohihere motus animi quos Graeci Trddrj vocant :" still, however, he
</p>
<p>has also the following : " consensus quam avinradeiav Graeci vacant."

</p>
<p>9. Tullianum. The prison at Rome was originally built by
</p>
<p>Ancus Martius, and afterwards enlarged by Servius Tullius ; whence
</p>
<p>that part of it which was under ground, and built by him, received
</p>
<p>the name of Tullianum. Thus Varro (L. L. 4) observes, " In hoc,
</p>
<p>pars quae sub terra Tullianum, ideo quod additum a Tullio rege."
</p>
<p>The full expression is Tullianum robur, from its walls having beer,
</p>
<p>originally of oak ; but in the days of Sallust they were of stone.
</p>
<p>This dungeon now serves as a subterranean chapel to a small church
</p>
<p>built on the spot, called San Pietro in carcere, in commemoration
</p>
<p>of St. Peter, who is supposed to have been confined there. Its only
</p>
<p>entrance, when a dungeon, was through a hole in the arched roof ;
</p>
<p>now, however, there is a door in the side-wall. " Notwithstanding
</p>
<p>the change," observes Eustace, " it has still a most appalling ap-
</p>
<p>pearance." Eustce Class. Tour, vol. 1, p. 365, note. Lcrnd. ed.

<p>10. Escenderis. An archaism for ascenderis. Some editions
</p>
<p>have descenderis, but erroneously , for escenderis refers to the eleva-
</p>
<p>tion on which the prison stood. Compare Descrizzione di Roma

<p>regular complement of each legion ; still, however, he divided what 113
</p>
<p>men he had into twenty cohorts, ten for a legion, and these cohorts
</p>
<p>he subdivided into maniples and centuries. The cohorts, maniples,
</p>
<p>and centuries, all wanted at first their regular complement of men,
</p>
<p>and only obtained it gradually as fresh troops arrived at the
</p>

</p>
<p>The legion, as has already been remarked in the Notes to the Jugur-

</p>
<p>from 3000 to 6000. In the time of Polybius it was 4200. The
</p>
<p>subject is well discussed by Lipsius, De Militia Pomona, dial. 4.
</p>
<p>Each legion was divided into ten cohorts, each cohort into three
</p>
<p>maniples, and each maniple into two centuries. So that there were
</p>
<p>thirty maniples and sixty centuries in a legion, and if there always
</p>
<p>had been 100 men in each century, as its name imports, the legion
</p>
<p>would have consisted of 6000 men.

<p>recurvum." Festus observes, " Spara parvissimi generis jacula,

</p>
<p>feigned illness on the day of battle, fearful of encountering the re-
</p>
<p>proaches of Catiline in case the latter should meet him in the fight.
</p>
<p>Catiline, according to the same authority, preferred coming to an
</p>
<p>engagement with the forces of Antonius rather than with those of
</p>
<p>Metellus, although the former commander had the larger army of the
</p>
<p>two, because he hoped that Antonius would purposely mismanage
</p>
<p>matters during the fight. Dio. Cass. 37, 39, vol. 1, p. 136, ed.
</p>

</p>
<p>13. Tumulti. A war in Italy, or against the Gauls, was called
</p>
<p>tumultus, a much stronger term than betlum.
</p>
<p>14. Ipse. Some commentators condemn the use of ipse in this,
</p>
<p>and tile in the preceding clause, with reference to the same person.
</p>
<p>The explanation, however, is an easy one : Antonius exercitum
</p>
<p>Petreio permittit. Ille Petreius, &c, (" that officer ;") and again,

<p>Petreius suum cuique cohorti locum assignat. Ipse equo cirmmiens.

</p>
<p>1. Cohortem praetoriam. Among the Romans, the general \\*j
</p>
<p>was usually attended by a select band, called cohors Praetoria. It
</p>
<p>was first instituted by Scipio Africanus, according to Festus, but
</p>
<p>something similar was used long before that time, as appears from
</p>
<p>Livy, 2, 20. This differs essentially from the praetorian cohort in
</p>
<p>the history of the empire.
</p>
<p>2. In primis. " Among the first," not, as some render it,
</p>
<p>11 among the foremost." The expression must be referred to cadunt.
</p>
<p>not to pugnantes. It would have been very scanty praise to have
</p>
<p>said of them, that they fell fighting " among the foremost," or " in
</p>
<p>the foremost ranks ;" for how could they, as commanders, have done
</p>
<p>otherwise ? Besides, if such had been the meaning of the historian,
</p>
<p>he would have preferred to express it by inter primos.
</p>
<p>3. Paullo diversius. " In a somewhat more scattered manner."
</p>
<p>4. Civis ingenuus. " Free citizen." Ingenuus, among the
</p>
<p>Romans, denoted a person born of parents who had always been
</p>
<p>free."
</p>
<p>5. Ita. " So little."
</p>
<p>6. Laetitia, moeror, &c. Laetitia properly denotes a transport
</p>
<p>of joy, or joy expressed strongly by the actions of the individual.
</p>
<p>Gaudium, on the contrary, indicates the calm and rational emotion
</p>
<p>of joy. So moeror denotes sorrow accompanied by tears, luctus
</p>
<p>more of internal grief.
</p>
<p>We have now reached the close of this eventful narrative, and have
</p>
<p>traced the progress of a conspiracy which, though arrested in its earlier

<p>the Roman state. It may not be amiss, before concluding, to mention
</p>
<p>a few particulars which are passed over in silence by the historian.
</p>
<p>From Dio Cassius, Lib. 37, c. 40 and 41, we learn, that Antonius, after
</p>
<p>the battle, sent the head of Catiline to Rome, in ordei to quiet all ap-
</p>
<p>prehension on the part of the inhabitants ; and that he himself was
</p>
<p>honoured with the title of Imperator, although he had taken no active part
</p>
<p>in the fight, and although the number of slain (3000) was less than

</p>
<p>that for which this title was usually awarded, (5000.) A public thanks-
</p>
<p>giving was also decreed, and the garb of mourning, which the citizens
</p>
<p>had assumed when the conspiracy broke out, was again laid aside. The
</p>
<p>accomplices of Catiline, who had either not been present in the battle,
</p>
<p>or had escaped from the field, spread themselves over Italy, but were
</p>
<p>in part taken and executed. One of the number, Lucius Vettius,
</p>
<p>turned informer against the rest : but he accused so many as to excite
</p>
<p>the suspicion of the senate, who ordered him, not to commit to writing
</p>
<p>the names of those against whom he informed, but to mention them at
</p>
<p>once by word of mouth. This confused and alarmed him, and but few
</p>
<p>were subsequently accused. The names of those whom he had impli-
</p>
<p>cated having been concealed from the people at large, great confusion
</p>
<p>and alarm consequently prevailed. To quiet this general feeling of in-
</p>
<p>security, the senate resolved to publish the names in question, which
</p>
<p>was accordingly done. Some of the accused stood trial and were con

<p>Aborigines. A name given by the Roman writers to the primitive
</p>
<p>race of the Latins. According to Cato, they dwelt originally about
</p>
<p>mount Velino f in Italy, and the lake of Celano, (Fueinns,) as far as Car-
</p>
<p>seoli, and towards lleate ; but were driven onward by the Sabines, who
</p>
<p>came from Aquila. (Dion. Hal. 2, 49.) On leaving this vicinity, they
</p>
<p>came down the Anio, and expelled the Siculi from the neighbourhood
</p>
<p>of Tibur, Antemnae, Crustumerium, and Aricia. Sallust represents them
</p>
<p>as a savage race, living in hordes, without any civilization, and ignorant
</p>
<p>of agriculture. This, however, does not agree with the traces of their
</p>
<p>towns in the Apennines. The Aborigines revered Janus and Saturn ;
</p>
<p>the latter of whom, according to some authorities, taught them hus-

<p>bandry, and induced them to choose settled habitations. From this
</p>
<p>ancient race, blended with a remnant of the Siculi, came the later Latin
</p>
<p>nation. (Compare Niebuhr, Rom. Hist., vol. i., p. 62. Cambridge

<p>Aegyptus. An extensive country of Africa, consisting of the long
</p>
<p>and narrow valley which follows the course of the Nile, from Syene
</p>
<p>(Assooan) to Cairo, together with the Delta, or triangular region, spread-
</p>
<p>ing from this point, to the Mediterranean sea. Sallust and Pomponius
</p>
<p>Mela (1, 8) consider it as a part of Asia, making Africa end at the
</p>
<p>Catabathmus. Other ancient writers give the Nile as forming the divi-
</p>
<p>ding line between Asia and Africa ; and, of course, make Egypt belon/
</p>
<p>half to the former continent and half to the latter. . . p. 14.
</p>
<p>Aethiopes. A race, according to Sallust, occupying the central parts
</p>
<p>of Africa, from east to west. The early Greeks meant by Aethkpes all
</p>
<p>races of a dark complexion (aiBw, uro, and <5\p f vultus,) and called their
</p>
<p>country Aethiopia, wherever situated. Hence, Homer speaks of the
</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Aethiopians, meaning by the former the Arabians,
</p>
<p>Indi, &c, and by the latter the natives of central Africa. Aethiopia,
</p>
<p>iccording to the more definite account of Herodotus, includes the coun-
</p>
<p>tries above Egypt, the present Nubia and Abyssinia ; and it is in some-
</p>
<p>what the same sense that the term is now employed, when we speak of
</p>
<p>Aethiopia as the parent of Egyptian civilization. . . p. 14 .

<p>Africa. Called by the Greeks Libya ; and commonly regarded by

<p>Europe and Asia, including Africa m Europe. In general, Africa was
</p>
<p>reckoned a third part. The name was first applied by the Romans to
</p>
<p>the immediate territories of Carthage. Hence, we find, on the coast of
</p>
<p>the Mediterranean, Africa Propria, corresponding to the modern country
</p>
<p>of Tunis. On the east, Africa is bounded by the isthmus of Suez, and
</p>
<p>the Sinus Arabicus, or Red sea ; on the north by the Mediterranean,
</p>
<p>called by the Romans Mare Nostrum ; on the west by the Atlantic ; and
</p>
<p>on the south by the Indian ocean. It is extremely doubtful whether the
</p>
<p>ancients were acquainted with the circumnavigation of Africa. Hero-
</p>
<p>dotus informs us, that it was accomplished by Phenician mariners, sent
</p>
<p>out by the orders of Necho, king of Egypt. . . p. 12, 13, 14.

<p>Africum M^re. Another name for that part of the Mediterranean

<p>which washes the shores of Africa. . Mela (1, 14) calls it Libycum

</p>
<p>was between Africa and the coast of Crete. ... p. 13.

</p>
<p>mont, and Savoy. Their chief city was Vienna, now Vienne, on the left
</p>
<p>bank of the Rhodanus, thirteen miles below Lugdunum, or Lyons. They
</p>
<p>were finally reduced beneath the Roman sway by Fabius Maximus, who
</p>
<p>hence was honoured with the surname of Allobrogicus. Their name is
</p>
<p>said to mean " Highlanders, " from Al, "high," and Broga, "land."

<p>Apulia. A country of Magna Graecia, lying along the coast of the

</p>
<p>country the appellation of Iapygia. It must be remarked, however, that
</p>
<p>the term Iapygia was confined at first to that peninsula, to which the name
</p>
<p>Messapia was sometimes applied ; but we find, at a later period, that
</p>
<p>Polybius gives to Iapygia the same extension which the Roman geogra-
</p>
<p>phers and historians assign to Apulia. The modern name of Apulia is

<p>divided into Armenia Major and Minor. The first of these answers to
</p>
<p>the modern Turcomania, and is still sometimes called Armenia, lying
</p>
<p>south of mount Caucasus, and comprehending the Turkish pachalics of
</p>
<p>Erze-Roum, Kars, and Van, and also the Persian province Iran, or
</p>
<p>Erivan. It was separated from Armenia Minor by the river Euphrates.
</p>
<p>Armenia Minor was, properly speaking, a part of Cappadocia. It is
</p>
<p>now called Aladulia, or Pegian. Armenia Major is a rough, mountain-
</p>
<p>ous country, which has Caucasus for its northern boundary, and in the
</p>
<p>centre is traversed by branches of mount Taurus, to which belongs
</p>
<p>mount Ararat. Here the rivers Euphrates, Tigris, and Cyrus, cr Kur s
</p>
<p>take their rise. The climate is rather cold than warm ; the soil ii

<p>Arpinum. A small town of Latium, southeast of Rome, still knows

<p>by the name of Arpino. It was famous for having been the birth-

<p>Arretinus Ager. The territory of Arretium, a city of Etruria,
</p>
<p>north of Cortona, and near the Arnus, or Arno. Its modern name is
</p>
<p>Arezzo. Arretium was a place of considerahle celebrity, and generally
</p>
<p>considered as one of the principal states of Etruria. It was much cele-
</p>
<p>brated for its terra cotta vases. [Plin. H. N. 35, 12.) . p. 97.

<p>Asia. One of the divisions of the ancient world. (Vid. Africa.)
</p>
<p>The name of Asia was applied by Homer, Herodotus, and Euripides, to
</p>
<p>a district of Lydia, watered by the Cayster. As their geographica.
</p>
<p>knowledge of the continent increased, the Greeks extended the term
</p>
<p>gradually to the whole of Asia Minor, and eventually to the other ex-
</p>
<p>tensive countries of the East. When the Roman writers refer to Asia
</p>
<p>specially, they mean the Roman province in Ask Minor. . p. 13, 85.

<p>Baleares. A name anciently given to the islands of Majorca and

<p>Minorca. The word is derived from the Greek PdXXeiv, " to throw,"
</p>
<p>or " strike," from the expertness of the inhabitants in the use of the
</p>
<p>sling. The Romans obtained some of their best slingers from these
</p>
<p>islands. In Majorca is Palma, which still retains its ancient name. Il
</p>
<p>Minorca is Portus Magonis, now Port Mahon. ... p. 72.
</p>
<p>Bruttii. A people of Magna Graecia, below Lucania. They were
</p>
<p>a pastoral race, and,' according to some of the ancient writers, were called
</p>
<p>Bruttii by the Romans, from their cowardice in submitting to Hannibal
</p>
<p>during the second Punic war. A much better etymology, however, is
</p>
<p>given by Strabo, who informs us, that they were called Bruttii from the
</p>
<p>circumstance of their being revolted slaves ; BpErriovs yap koXovcl dTroaTa-
</p>
<p>rag, says Strabo, speaking of the Lucanians. This appellation the in-

<p>surgents are supposed to have accepted as a term of defiance. The

<p>Bruttii flocked eagerly to the victorious standard of Hannibal, and sub-

<p>sequently enabled that commander to maintain his ground in this quarter

<p>of Italy, when all hope of final success seemed to be extinguished.
</p>
<p>Hence they were reduced by the Romans to the most abject state of
</p>
<p>dependance, after the departure of the Carthaginian general and the

<p>Capsa. A city of Africa, in the district of Byzacium, north of the
</p>
<p>Palus Tritonis, and surrounded by vast deserts. Here Jugurtha kept

<p>his treasures. It was surprised aud burnt by Marius. As, however, a
</p>
<p>place whljh affords fresh water in the midst of a desert is too important
</p>
<p>a site to remain long unoccupied, we find the city subsequently rebuilt,
</p>
<p>and Ihe inhabitants mentioned by Pliny {H. N. 5. 4) under the name
</p>
<p>of Capsitani. Ptolemy speaks of Capsa as a city in his days, occupied
</p>
<p>most probably by Romans, and forming a kind of frontier place. The
</p>
<p>origin which Sallust ascribes to Capsa, its having been founded, namely,
</p>
<p>by the Lybian Hercules, assimilates it to the cities of Egypt, and points
</p>
<p>to a sacerdotal colony. Even its other name, Hecatompylos, reminds
</p>
<p>us of Egyptian Thebes and its hundred gates. (Ma?inert, Geogr., vol. x.,

</p>
<p>Capua. The capital of Campania in Italy, a rich and flourishing city
</p>
<p>until ruined by the Romans. Capua was originally called Vulturous,
</p>
<p>which name was changed by the Tyrrheni, after they became masters
</p>
<p>of the place, to Capua. This latter appellation was derived from their
</p>
<p>leader Capys, who, according to Festus, was so called from his feet
</p>
<p>being deformed and turned inward. Capua opened its gates to Hanni-
</p>
<p>bal after the battle of Cannae, and the luxury of the city proved highly
</p>
<p>injurious to the martial spirit of his troops. After the retreat of the
</p>
<p>Carthaginian general, this place surrendered at discretion to the Romans,
</p>
<p>who butchered the senators, condemned the nobles to perpetual impris-
</p>
<p>onment, and sold the inhabitants as slaves. Although colonies were
</p>
<p>afterwards sent to inhabit this city, it never regained its former magnifi-
</p>
<p>cence. Genseric, the Vandal, in a later age, put the people to the
</p>
<p>sword, and burnt the city. Narses, in the reign of Justinian, perceiving
</p>
<p>the advantages of its situation, rebuilt Capua about the middle of the
</p>
<p>sixth century. It was destroyed, however, by the Saracens, A. D. 341
</p>
<p>Modern Capua occupies the site, not of the ancient city, but of Casili-
</p>
<p>nnm, on the Vulturous, 19 stadia distant ; the inhabitants having been
</p>
<p>transferred to the latter place by the bishop Landulpus and the Lombard
</p>
<p>count Lando. The village of St. Maria marks the true site of the
</p>
<p>ancient place. {Mannert, Geogr. vol. ix, part 1, p. 771.) . p. 94.

<p>Carthago. A celebrated commercial city of Africa, the rival, for a
</p>
<p>long period, of the Roman power. It was founded by a colony from
</p>
<p>Tyre, according to the common account, B. C. 878. Some, however,
</p>
<p>suppose that the city was more than once founded, and rebuilt or en-
</p>
<p>larged, and in this way they seek to remove the difficulty occasioned by
</p>
<p>the conflicting accounts respecting the foundation of this city, by refer-
</p>
<p>ring them to different epochs. (Heyne, Excurs. 1. ad Aen. 4.) In
</p>
<p>this point of view, the third founding of Carthage will be assigned to
</p>
<p>Dido. The Greeks called Carthage K.ap%ri8wv J and the inhabitants
</p>
<p>K.*PXn36vt9i. The name of the city in Punic was Carthada, or Cariha-
</p>
<p>Hadath, i. e. the " New City, "in contra-distinction, perhaps, to the old
</p>
<p>or parent city of Tyre ; unless, perhaps, the term refer rather to the
</p>
<p>renovation of an earlier city by the arrival of a new colony, which wi)
</p>
<p>agree with the theory of the several foundings of Carthage. Carthage
</p>
<p>was situated on a peninsula, in the recess of a spacious bay, formed bv
</p>
<p>the promontory Hermaeum (cape Bon) on the east, and that of Apollo
</p>
<p>(cape Zibb) on the w r est. The river Bagradas flows into the bay be-
</p>
<p>tween the remains of Ufcca and the peninsula ; and, being an inundating
</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX. 299
</p>
<p>river, has doubtless caused many changes in the bay. The circunifer
</p>
<p>ence of the site of Carthage was twenty-three miles, and when it was
</p>
<p>set on fire by the Romans, at the close of the third Punic war, it burnt
</p>
<p>incessantly for seventeen days. It is unnecessary here to enter very
</p>
<p>fully into the history of this powerful city. The wars waged between
</p>
<p>it and the Romans were denominated the Punic, and were three in
</p>
<p>number. The first Punic war continued twenty- three years, and was
</p>
<p>terminated by the defeat of the Carthaginians off the Aegades Insula.
</p>
<p>The second lasted about seventeen years, during nearly sixteen of which
</p>
<p>Hannibal was in Italy. It was ended by the battle of Zama. The third
</p>
<p>was nothing more than the capture and destruction of Carthage. Julius
</p>
<p>Caesar planted a small colony on the ruins of Carthage. Augustus sent
</p>
<p>3,000 men thither, and built a city at a small distance from the spot on
</p>
<p>which- the ancient place had stood, thus avoiding the ill effects of the
</p>
<p>mprecations, which had been pronounced by the Romans, according to
</p>
<p>custom, at the time of its destruction, against those who should rebuild
</p>
<p>it. This later Carthage was taken by Genseric, A. D. 439, and it was
</p>
<p>for more than a century the seat of the Vandal pow r er in Africa. It was
</p>
<p>at last destroyed by the Saracens, during the Caliphate of Abdel Melek,
</p>
<p>towards the end of the seventh century, and few traces of it now re-
</p>
<p>main.  p. 14, 29, 52, 84

<p>Catabathmos. A sloping tract of land, whence its name, (Kara-

<p>Pliny. - Sallust makes it the boundary between Egypt and Africa. ( Vid.
</p>
<p>Aegyptus.) It was commonly called Catabathmus Magnus, to distin-
</p>
<p>guish it from a similar declivity of less extent farther to the east, along
</p>
<p>the same coast, but within the territory of Egypt. The modern name

<p>of the Catabathmus Magnus is Akabct-ossolom. . . p. 13, 14.

<p>countries, entered and overran Gaul, and defeated four Roman armies
</p>
<p>n succession. Marius, at last, in his second consulship, was chosen to
</p>
<p>rry on the war. He met the Teutones at Aquae Sextiae, in Gaul, and,
</p>
<p>after a bloody engagement, left 20,000 of the enemy dead on the field
</p>
<p>of battle, and took 90,000 prisoners. The Cimbri, who had formed
</p>
<p>another army, had already penetrated into Italy, where they were met at
</p>
<p>the river Athesis by Marius and his colleague Catulus, a year after. An
</p>
<p>engagement ensued, and, if w T e believe the ancient accounts, 140,000
</p>
<p>were slain. Those who escaped the sword of Marius settled in that
</p>
<p>art of the Alps called Sette Commune, where their descendants still
</p>
<p>retain the Teutonic language, and a traditional account of their origin,
</p>
<p>They keep themselves quite separate from the surrounding states^ bj
</p>
<p>which means they have preserved the language of their ancestors, in a
</p>
<p>great degree, uncorrupted. The late king of Denmark visited these
</p>
<p>Alpine Cimbrians, and readily conversed with them, when both parties,
</p>
<p>speaking their native languages, understood each other.

</p>
<p>and being, in fact, the only city originally in that part of the country ,
</p>
<p>and erected by Carthaginian workmen, it hence took the Pumc name of
</p>
<p>Cartha, or, " the city." It was the residence of Syphax, Masinissa, and
</p>
<p>the other rulers of the land. At a later period, Julius Caesar gave it to
</p>
<p>a certain Sittius, who aided him with his followers against Scipio and
</p>
<p>Juba. The place now changed its name to Sittianorum Colonia. In
</p>
<p>the time of the emperor Constantine, having suffered much on account
</p>
<p>of its fidelity to that prince, the latter repaired and embellished it, and
</p>
<p>gave it the name of Constantino,. This name remains with a slight
</p>
<p>variation to the present day, and the small city, built upon the ruins of

<p>close.
</p>
<p>Crotona, or Croto, now Cotrone, a powerful city of Magna Graecia.
</p>
<p>in the territory of the Bruttii, on the coast of the Sinus Tarentinus. h
</p>
<p>was distinguished for its attachment to the doctrines of the Pythagorean
</p>
<p>sect, and the consequent purity and morality of its inhabitants. Luxury,
</p>
<p>and the love of pleasure, howevei, came in at last, and destroyed all the
</p>
<p>good effects which had emanated from the school of Pythagoras. Until
</p>
<p>this change took place, the Crotoniats were remarkable for their hardi-
</p>
<p>hood and vigour, and had conquered and destroyed the wealthy and
</p>
<p>effeminate city of Sybaris. As a proof, indeed, of the robust frames of
</p>
<p>its inhabitants, and their skill in athletic exercises, it was commonly
</p>
<p>said, that the last wrestler of Crotona was the first of the other Greeks.
</p>
<p>When, however, the change took place in their own morals, they degen-
</p>
<p>erated to such a degree, that, being engaged in hostilities with the
</p>
<p>Locrians, an army of 130,000 Crotoniats was routed by 10,000 of the
</p>
<p>enemy on the banks of the Sagra. After this, it gradually declined in
</p>
<p>importance, until the inhabitants, unable to hold out against Hannibal,
</p>
<p>retired to Locri, when the Romans established a colony in it. Pliny

<p>of the Mediterranean.. It was founded by Battus, who led thither a
</p>
<p>colony of Dorians from the island of Thera. In the immediate neigh-
</p>
<p>bourhood of the settlement was a copious spring of excellent water,
</p>
<p>which the new comers are said to have called the fountain of Apollo,
</p>
<p>and to have converted the native appellation for the same into the Greek
</p>

</p>
<p>Etruria. A district of Italy, lying north and west of the Tiber.
</p>
<p>The origin of the Etrurian nation is unknown, although many, without
</p>
<p>any very strong reasons for the opinion, regard them as having been a
</p>
<p>Celtic race. Their civilization came in with the Tyrrheni, who appear
</p>
<p>to have been identical with the Pelasgi. The statement of Herodotus,
</p>
<p>that the Tyrrheni, or Etrurians, were of Lydian origin, appears to refer
</p>
<p>merely to a Pelasgic emigration. The Etrurians excelled in the know-
</p>
<p>ledge of augury, and in the worship of the gods. In these respects the
</p>
<p>Romans seem to have done little more than adopt the ceremonies and
</p>
<p>institutions of their neighbours, who were for a long period their de-
</p>
<p>termined and powerful enemies. After long continued war and much
</p>
<p>carnage, the Romans oDtamed a complete victory over cliein, and com-
</p>
<p>pelled them to submit to such conditions as they chose to dictate. The
</p>
<p>Etrurians were divided into twelve states, of which each adopted that
</p>
<p>form of government which seemed most agreeable, though the leading
</p>
<p>feature in all was aristocratic. The want of a common bond of union
</p>
<p>contributed very materially to their final subjugation by the Romans.

<p>Etruria corresponds, in a great measure, to the present Grand Duchy
</p>
<p>of Tuscany. ......... p. 93

<p>Faesulae. Now Fiesoli, a town of Italy, in Etruria, southeast oi

<p>Pistoria. Here Catiline raised the standard of rebellion. In modern
</p>
<p>times, it is rather a village than a town. The Goths, when they entered

<p>Italy, under the consulate of Stilico and Aurelian, A. D. 400, were de-
</p>

<p>Gaetuli. The inhabitants of Gaetulia, in Africa. Gaetulia lay to
</p>
<p>the south of Numidia, and answers in some degree to the modem Be
</p>
<p>Icddgerid. The Gaetuli, like the Numidians, excelled in horsemanship
</p>
<p>and, like them, rode barebacked. p. 13

<p>Gallia. An extensive country of Europe, lying between the Rhine,
</p>
<p>the Alps, the Mediterranean, the Pyrenees, and the ocean. It was more
</p>
<p>extensive, therefore, to the north and east than modern France. The
</p>
<p>Lame Galli, given to the inhabitants by the Roman writers, is the Celtic
</p>
<p>term Gael, Latinised. The Greeks called them K&rai, and their coun-
</p>
<p>try KsXrtKf] and YaXarla.

<p>Gallia Citerior. Called also Gallia Cisalpina, a name given by the
</p>
<p>Romans to that part of Italy which lay between the Alps and the rivers

<p>Rubicon and Macra. It was occupied by various Gallic tribes, whicb

</p>
<p>had poured over the Alps into this extensive tract of country. Livy
</p>
<p>assigns to these migrations the date of 600 B. C. ; but in all probability
</p>
<p>they were much earlier.
</p>
<p>Gallia Cispadana. Gaul south of the Padus, or Po ; or, in other
</p>
<p>words, that part of northern Italy which lay between the Po and the
</p>
<p>fivers Rubicon and Macra. The remaining portion between the Po and
</p>
<p>the Alps, was called Gallia Transpadana.
</p>
<p>Gallia Togata. Commonly regarded as only another name for
</p>
<p>Gallia Cisalpina, but applying in strictness merely to Gallia Cispadana.
</p>
<p>The name has reference to the country's being occupied by individuals
</p>
<p>who enjoyed the rights of Roman citizenship, or, in other words, the
</p>
<p>privilege of wearing the toga. These inhabitants appear to have been
</p>
<p>settled here in colonies after the Gauls were driven out. (Compare

<p>Hadrumetum. The capital of Byzacium, a district of Africa Propria.
</p>
<p>The place, according to Sallust, was of Phoenician origin, and owed its-
</p>
<p>prosperity, in a great measure, to the fertility of the surrounding coun-
</p>
<p>try ; since, although situate near the coast, it does not appear to have had
</p>
<p>any harbour. It suffered severely in Caesar's wars, but was afterwards
</p>
<p>restored and enlarged by a colony being sent hither in the time of the
</p>
<p>emperors, especially Trajan. The place was destroyed by the Saracens.
</p>
<p>Its site has been made a matter of much discussion at the present day
</p>
<p>D'Anville places it near the modern Susa, in the territory of Tunis.

<p>Hippo. A city of Numidia, in the western part, on a bay near the
</p>
<p>promontory of Hippi. It was called Hippo Regius, not only to dis-
</p>
<p>tinguish it from Hippo Zarytus, a town on the coast to the west of Utica,
</p>
<p>but also from its having been one of the royal cities of the Numidian
</p>
<p>monarchs. The place was of Phoenician origin. St. Augustine was

<p>bishop here. Near the ancient site is a town named Bona. . p. 14.

<p>and Ulterior. Hispania Citerior was also called Tarraconensis, from

<p>comprehending all the north of Spain, together with the south, as far as
</p>
<p>a line drawn below Carthago Nova, (now Carthagena,) and continued
</p>
<p>in an oblique direction to the river Durius, passing by Salamantica
</p>
<p>(now Salamanca). Hispania Ulterior was divided into two provinces,
</p>
<p>Baetica, in the south of Spain, between the Anas (now Guadiana) and
</p>
<p>Citerior ; and above it Lusitania, corresponding, in a great measi re, to

<p>name from the Greek colonies settled there, and comprehended the prov-
</p>
<p>inces of Campania, Apulia, Lucania, Messapia, and Bruttium. All

<p>Latium. A country of Italy, lying south of Etruria, from which it
</p>
<p>was separated by the river Tiber. In it stood Rome, Alba, Lavinium,
</p>
<p>Tusculum, Arpinum, Praeneste, &c. The name of Latium was at first
</p>
<p>given to that portion of Italy only, which extends from the mouth of the
</p>
<p>Tiber to the promontory of Circeii ; but subsequently this latter boundary-
</p>
<p>'s removed to the river Liris, whence arose the distinction of Latium
</p>
<p>Antiquum and Novum. At a still later period, the southern boundary
</p>
<p>of Latium was extended from the Liris to the mouth of the river Vultur-
</p>
<p>nus and the Massic hills. . . . . . p. 47

<p>Leptis. There were two cities of this name in Africa. 1. The first,
</p>
<p>called for distinction sake Leptis Mo.gna, w r as situate towards the
</p>
<p>greater Syrtis, at the southeast extremity of the district of Tripolis. It
</p>
<p>was founded by the Phoenicians, and ranked next to Carthage and Utica,
</p>
<p>among their maritime cities. Under the Romans, it was signalized, as
</p>
<p>Sallust informs us, by its fidelity and obedience. It was destroyed by
</p>
<p>the Vandals, rebuilt by the emperor Justinian, and finally demolished by
</p>
<p>the Saracens. Lebida now marks the ancient site. 2. The other city
</p>
<p>of Leptis, called also Leptis Parva, was situate in Africa Propria, in
</p>
<p>the district of Byzacium, or Emporiae, about eighteen miles below Ha-
</p>
<p>drumetum, on the coast. It is now Lempta. This city paid a talent

<p>Libya. The name given by the Greek writers and the Roman poets
</p>
<p>to what was otherwise called Africa. In a more restricted sense, the
</p>
<p>name has been applied to that part of Africa which contained the two
</p>
<p>countries of Cyrenaica and Marmarica, together with a very extensive
</p>
<p>region inland, and which was generally styled Libya Interior. . p. 13
</p>
<p>Ligures. The natives of Liguria. This country formed part of
</p>
<p>Cisalpine Gaul, and lay along the shores of the Sinus Ligusticus, or
</p>
<p>gulf of Genoa, between the Varus on the west, and the Macra on the
</p>
<p>east. The Ligures appear to have been a numerous and powerful people
</p>
<p>extending at an early period along the shores of the Mediterranean, from
</p>
<p>the mouth of the Rhodanus to that of the Arnus, reaching also into f he
</p>
<p>interior of Gaul, and the valleys of the maritime Alps. In the days of
</p>
<p>he Roman dominion, however, their limits were contracted as first above

<p>stated. The Ligurians were a bold and hardy mountain ^r-race, and
</p>
<p>they were not conquered by the Romans until after many years of war-
</p>
<p>fare. The possession of their country was important, as affording
</p>
<p>the easiest communication with Gaul and Spain over the maritime
</p>
<p>Alps p. 27

</p>
<p>Macedonia. A country of Europe, lying to the west of Thrace, and
</p>
<p>north and northeast of Thessaly. It was reduced under the Roman
</p>
<p>sway by Paulus Aemilius, who defeated and took prisoner its last monarch
</p>
<p>Perses, in the memorable battle of Pydna. Before the time of Philip,
</p>
<p>father of Alexander, all the country beyond the river Strymon, and even
</p>
<p>the Macedonian peninsula, from Amphipolis to Thessalonica, belonged
</p>
<p>to Thrace, and Paeonia likewise on the north. But, when enlarged
</p>
<p>by conquest, the limits of Macedonia were from the river Nessus in
</p>
<p>Thrace to the Ionian sea, including Paeonia, and Illyria beyond lake
</p>
<p>Lychnitis. As a Roman province, however, Macedonia did not include
</p>
<p>Epirus p. 25.
</p>
<p>Massilia. A celebrated colony of the Phoceans, on the Mediter-
</p>
<p>ranean coast of Gaul, now Marseilles. It became at an early period a
</p>
<p>powerful and flourishing city, and was famed for its extensive commerce.
</p>
<p>The most prosperous period in its history would seem to have been the
</p>
<p>interval from the fall of Carthage, with which city it had frequent col-
</p>
<p>lisions, to the commencement of the contest between Caesar and Pom-
</p>
<p>pey. This city was always the firm ally of Rome. It suffered severely
</p>
<p>in the civil wars from its attachment to the party of Pompey, being
</p>
<p>compelled to sustain a severe siege, in which its fleet was destroyed,
</p>
<p>and, after surrendering, to pay a heavy exaction. Massilia became after-
</p>
<p>wards, in the days of Augustus, famous as a seat of science, and the
</p>
<p>rival of Athens. p. 96.
</p>
<p>Mauretania. A country of Africa, lying to the west of Numidia,
</p>
<p>and answering now to the modern Fez and Morocco. It was, properly
</p>
<p>speaking, in the time of Bocchus, bounded by the river Mulucha, now
</p>
<p>Malva, on the east, and corresponded nearly to the modern Fez; but,
</p>

<p>Medi. The people of Media, in Upper Asia. Their country lay to

<p>the east of Assyria, and was separated from Armenia on the north by

<p>the river Araxes. The capital was Ecbatana, now Hammada?i. When
</p>
<p>first mentioned in history, the Medes were a brave people. Like other

<p>Numantia. A town of Spain, near the sources of the river Durius,
</p>
<p>celebrated for the brave resistance which it made against the Romans
</p>
<p>for the space of fourteen years. It was built upon an eminence of no
</p>
<p>great height, between two branches of the Durius, and surrounded by a
</p>
<p>very thick wood on three sides. One path alone led down into the
</p>
<p>plain, and this was defended by ditches and palisades. The great length
</p>
<p>of time it withstood the Romans may be easily accounted for by its dif-
</p>
<p>ficult situation, and the circumstance of its circuit being so large, that
</p>
<p>within it were even pastures for cattle. The place was at last reduced
</p>
<p>by Scipio Africanus Minor, the conqueror of Carthage. The Numan-
</p>
<p>tines had withstood an army of 40,000 men with less than one fourth of
</p>
<p>that number, and had not only hitherto held out, but frequently gained
</p>
<p>very considerable advantages over the enemy, and obliged them to ac-
</p>
<p>cede to dishonourable treaties. The remains of Numantia may be still
</p>
<p>seen near Puente de Don Gartay. p. 5.
</p>
<p>Numidia. A country of Africa, east of Mauretania, and correspond-
</p>
<p>ing, in a great measure, to the modern Algiers. It was originally
</p>
<p>divided into two petty kingdoms, that of the Massyli to the east, and of
</p>
<p>the Massaesyli to the west, the line of separation between them being
</p>
<p>marked by the Tretum Promontorium, and a part of the river Ampsagas.
</p>
<p>Syphax was monarch of the Massaesyli, and Massinissa of the Massyli.
</p>
<p>The territory of Syphax w r as bestowed upon Massinissa by the Romans,
</p>
<p>after the close of the second Punic war, and he w T as allowed to enjoy
</p>
<p>the possession of this until the day of his death. After the termination
</p>
<p>of the Jugurthine contest, the Romans appear to have taken no part
</p>
<p>of the kingdom of Numidia to themselves, but to have distributed it
</p>
<p>among the different surviving branches of the royal line. In the civiJ
</p>
<p>wars between Caesar and Pompey, Juba, the great grandson of Massinissa,
</p>
<p>had the misfortune to espouse the side of the latter. After the victory of
</p>
<p>Thapsus, therefore, Caesar declared the whole kingdom of Numidia to
</p>
<p>be a Roman territory ; and Sallust, the historian, was sent thither as
</p>
<p>its governor. The western district around Cirta was at the same time
</p>
<p>bestowed upon Sittius in recompense for his services. Augustus be-

<p>Peligni. An Italian tribe belonging to the Sabine race, situate to

<p>which was selected by the allies in the social war as the seat of their

<p>empire, bounded on the east by Carmania, on the north by Media, on
</p>
<p>the west by Susiana, and on the south by the Persian gulf. This is

<p>Philenon Arae Altars erected by the Carthaginians in memory
</p>
<p>of the brothers Phileni. They stood in the innermost bend of the Syrtis

<p>Major, and not, as Sallust erroneously. states, {Jug. 19>) to the west of
</p>
<p>both the Syrtes. The story of the Phileni, as given by the historian,
</p>
<p>wears, to many, a very doubtful appearance, from the circumstance of
</p>
<p>Gyrene's being so much nearer to the point in question than Carthage.
</p>
<p>If the distance between these two cities be divided into eight equal
</p>
<p>parts, the Phileni will be found to have travelled six, and the deputies
</p>
<p>from Cyrene only two, of these parts. The truth, however, ap-
</p>
<p>pears to be, that the territory in dispute between the two powers, lay
</p>
<p>between Hesperis on the Cyrenean side, and Leptis Magna on the
</p>
<p>Carthaginian, and that the deputies started actually from these two
</p>
<p>points, not from Carthage and Cyrene. {Mariner t. Geogr., vol. x.,

<p>distance of about thirty-five geographical miles. The breadth was very
</p>
<p>limited, the ranges of Libanus and Antilibanus forming the utmost bar-
</p>
<p>rier to the east. The .Phoenicians were a branch of that widely-extended
</p>
<p>race, known by the common appellation of Aramean, or Semitic. They

<p>branch of the Arnus, or Arno. Pliny {H. N. 3, 5) calls it Pistorium ;
</p>
<p>but Ptolemy and others give it the appellation of Pistoria. The modern
</p>
<p>name is Pistoia. This place is memorable from having witnessed in
</p>
<p>its vicinity the close of Catiline's desperate career. The spot on which
</p>
<p>the action was fought is too imperfectly marked by the concise narra-
</p>
<p>tive of Sallust to be now recognised. We may conjecture, however,

<p>that it was to the north of Pistoia, and near the modern road from that

<p>lay to the southwest of the coast of Caria, and about forty-three miles
</p>
<p>distant from the main land. Rhodes sided with the Roman power, and
</p>
<p>became a valuable auxiliary to their rising greatness. In return for the
</p>
<p>important services thus rendered, it received from its new friends the
</p>
<p>territories of Lycia and Caria ; but suspicion and distrust eventually
</p>
<p>arose, the Rhodians were deprived of their possessions in Asia, and, at
</p>
<p>last, in the reign of Vespasian, of their freedom. Rhodes was famed
</p>
<p>for its Colossus, or statue of the sun, the work of Chares, who spent
</p>
<p>twelve years in the execution. An earthquake threw it down after it
</p>
<p>had stood erect for sixty-six years. It remained in ruins for 894 years,
</p>
<p>until A. D. 672, when the Saracens sold it to a Jewish merchant of
</p>
<p>Edessa, wno loaaea yuu camels with the brass. . . p. 106.
</p>
<p>Roma. Of this celebrated city, it will be sufficient here to remark,
</p>
<p>that it stood on the southern bank of the Tiber, below the junction of
</p>
<p>that river and the Anio, and about fifteen miles from the sea. It was
</p>
<p>divided into twenty-four regions or wards, had seven great, and thirteen
</p>
<p>smaller, aqueducts, thirty-seven gates, and six hundred and forty-four
</p>
<p>towers on the walls. Its population, when greatest, did not proba-
</p>
<p>bly fall much below four millions. The seat of empire was transferred
</p>
<p>to Byzantium, by Constantine, A. D. 328 ; and Rome itself was taken
</p>
<p>by Odoacer, king of the Heruii, A. D. 476, which put an end to the
</p>
<p>empire of the west.
</p>
<p>Samnites. A people of Italy, whose territory, Samnium, lay to the
</p>
<p>east of Campania and the lower extremity of Latium. The Samnites

<p>were of Sabine origin, and famed for their valour, which displayed itself
</p>
<p>in their long conflict with the Roman power. They only ceased to
</p>
<p>exist as a nation after their overthrow by Sylla. . . . p. 108.
</p>
<p>Sicca. A city of Numidia, on the river Bagradas, and at some dis-
</p>
<p>tance from the coast. It was called Sicca Venerea, from a temple of
</p>
<p>Venus which it contained. Bochart and De Brosses derive the name
</p>
<p>of Sicca from the Punic Succoth Benoth, (i. e. " tabernacula puellarum,')
</p>
<p>and make Benoth (" pueila") the origin of the word Venus among the
</p>
<p>Romans. According to Shaw, the modern Kaff stands near the site of
</p>
<p>the ancient city. This, however, is doubtful. . . . p. 39
</p>
<p>Sicilia. A well-known island in the Mediterranean, separated from
</p>
<p>Italy by the Fretum Siculum, or Straits of Messina. Its triangular
</p>
<p>shape gave it the appellations of Trinacria and Triquetra, (rpeTg-aKpai.
</p>
<p>and TpeTs-eSoai.) The promontory nearest Italy was called Pelorum

<p>now carte Faro. ThA art f 6 $t -oath of rfriS wss Pachvnum, nfo

<p>Passaro ; and the remaining one Lilybaeum, now Boeo. This last,
</p>
<p>however, is in truth not a mountain-promontory, but a low, flat point of
</p>
<p>land, rendered dangerous to vessels by its sand-banks and concealed
</p>
<p>rocks. Sicilia derived its name from the ancient Siculi, who came into
</p>
<p>this island from Latium. ....... p. 20.
</p>
<p>Sidonii. . The people of Sidon, in Phoenicia. This was the oldest,
</p>
<p>and, until eclipsed by its colony Tyre, the most powerful of the Phoeni-
</p>
<p>cian cities. The inhabitants appear to have acquired at an early period
</p>
<p>a pre-eminence in arts, manufactures, and commerce. The modern
</p>
<p>Snide is still a considerable town, but the harbour is nearly choked with
</p>
<p>sand. Sidon was about twenty-four miles north of Tyre. . p. 51.
</p>
<p>Suthul. A town of Numidia, of which Sallust alone makes mention.
</p>
<p>M. Barbie du Bocage suspects that this town is the same wnh that called
</p>
<p>Sufetala (now Sbaitla) in the Itin. Ant. The name Suthul is said to
</p>
<p>signify u the town of eagles." p. 27.
</p>
<p>Syrtes. The Syrtes were two bays or golfs on the coast of Africa,
</p>
<p>of which the one was called Syrtis Major, the other Syrtis Minor. The
</p>
<p>latter is now termed the gulf of Cabes, from the ancient city of Tacape,
</p>
<p>which stood at the head of it. It is about forty-five geographical miles
</p>
<p>in breadth, and runs up into the continent about seventy-five miles. It
</p>
<p>is opposite to the islands of Sicily and Malta, and was reckoned the
</p>
<p>more dangerous of the two. This gulf is still an object of apprehension
</p>
<p>to mariners, in consequence of the variations and uncertainties of the
</p>
<p>tides on a flat and shelvy coast. The Syrtis Major is about one hundred
</p>
<p>and eighty geographical miles between the two capes, and penetrates one
</p>
<p>hundred miles into the land. The natives call it Syrte-al-Kibber, i. e.
</p>
<p>the Great Syrtis, and sailors, Sydra, or Seedra. The name Syrtis is
</p>
<p>generally derived from the Greek ovpw, " to drag," in allusion to the
</p>
<p>agitation of the sand by the force of the tides. (Compare Sallust,
</p>
<p>Jugurth. c. 78.) It is more than probable, however, that the appella-
</p>
<p>tion is to be deduced from the term Sert, which still exists in Arabic as
</p>
<p>the name for a desert tract or region : for the term Syrtis does not ap-
</p>
<p>pear to have been confined to the mere gulfs themselves, but to have
</p>
<p>been extended also to the desert country adjacent, which is still at the

<p>Terracina. A city of Latium, called also Anxur, situate on the sea-

<p>was probably its Volscian name. We learn from Horace that this city

<p>stood on the lofty rock at the foot of which the modern Terracina is

<p>situate. According to Strabo, it was first called Trachina, a Greek ap-

<p>to have been of volcanic origin, as, according to some accounts, two

<p>islands near it rose on a sudden from the sea. Its earlier name was

<p>Calliste, in allusion to its beauty. .... p. 14.

</p>
<p>from west to east, and the chain of mount Haemus and the shores of

<p>Tisidium. A town of Numidia, supposed by some to have been the

<p>Utica A city of Africa, on the seacoast, southwest of Carthage,

<p>and separated from its immediate district by the river Bagradas. Utica
</p>
<p>was the earliest, or one of the earliest, colonies planted by Tyre on the
</p>
<p>African coast ; and Bochart derives the name from the Phoenician Atike,
</p>
<p>i. e. " ancient." The Greek name of the place, 'Itvkti, is perhaps a cor-
</p>
<p>ruption of this. Justin makes Utica more ancient than Carthage. It
</p>
<p>was more or less dependant, however, on the power of this latter city,
</p>
<p>and hence the disaffection frequently shown by its inhabitants to the Car-
</p>
<p>thaginian canse. Utica rose in importance after the fall of Carthage
</p>
<p>When, however, Carthage was rebuilt, it again took the second rank.
</p>
<p>Here Cato the younger put an end to his existence, whence the name

<p>Ad ierbal. Son of Micipsa, and grandson of Masinisaa, besieged at
</p>
<p>Cirta, and put to death by Jugurtha, after imploring in vain the aid of
</p>
<p>Rome, B. C. 112. Gesenius conjectures the origin of this proper
</p>
<p>name, from the Hebrew Addir, (" great,") and Baal, (" lord.") Claudiar

<p>AlbInus. Aulus Postumius, brother of Spurius Postumius Albinus,
</p>
<p>the consul, who obtained by lot Numidia for his province, B. C. 112.
</p>
<p>Aulus, and the Roman army entrusted to his care by his brother, were
</p>
<p>entrapped by Jugurtha, and compelled to pass under the yoke. The senate
</p>
<p>refused to ratify the treaty which he made on this occasion with the
</p>
<p>Numidian monarch. Liyy (Ep. 64) calls him lieutenant-general, not
</p>
<p>propraetor, the term applied by Sallust
</p>
<p>Albinus. Spurius Postumius, elected consul with M. Minucius Rufus,
</p>
<p>112 B. C; and who, in the allotment of the provinces, obtained Numi-
</p>
<p>dia, while his colleague got Macedonia. He appears to have been a com-
</p>
<p>mander of very inferior abilities, and was repeatedly foiled and baffled by
</p>
<p>Jugurtha. Being compelled to return to Rome, to attend the elections,
</p>
<p>he left his army in charge of his brother Aulus, whom Jugurtha entrapped
</p>
<p>and compelled to pass under the yoke. On returning to Africa, he was
</p>
<p>forced by the wretched state of the troops to remain inactive. In this
</p>
<p>condition he resigned the army to Metellus, who superseded him in the
</p>
<p>command.
</p>
<p>Annius, Lucius. A tribune of the commons, who made a vigorous
</p>
<p>effort to retain his office, after the expiration of his legal term. He was
</p>
<p>aided in this attempt by one of his colleagues, P. Licinius Lucullus, in
</p>
<p>opposition to the other tribunes ; and the struggles of these two prevented
</p>
<p>the election of the other magistrates during a whole year.
</p>
<p>Annius, Quintus. A man of senatorian rank, who entered into the
</p>
<p>conspiracy of Catiline. He effected his escape, when some of the ring-
</p>
<p>leaders were apprehended, and appears to have eluded the search of the
</p>
<p>sge-Qts of government, and to have gone unpunished.

<p>Antonius, Caius. A Roman, son of M. Antonius, the orator, and
</p>
<p>brother of M. Antonius Creticus, the father of the triumvir. He was
</p>
<p>originally in habits of very great intimacy with Gatiline, and the arrange-
</p>
<p>ment was that these two should stand for the consulship, and, if they

</p>
<p>succeeded, commence, while in this high office, their plans of revolution
</p>
<p>Cicero defeated this scheme, and, being elected consul with Antonius foi
</p>
<p>his colleague, succeeded in detaching the latter from the conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>from every other design formed against the state. He effected this de-
</p>
<p>sirable object by yielding to Antonius the rich province of Macedonia,
</p>
<p>which had fallen to his own lot. In the action between the forces of
</p>
<p>Catiline and those of the republic, Antonius took no part, having been
</p>
<p>prevented, according to Sallust, by a complaint in his feet. Dio Cassius,
</p>
<p>however, states expressly, that he feigned illness on this occasion, through
</p>
<p>fear of encountering the reproaches of Catiline, in case they should meet
</p>
<p>in the fight. After the conspiracy was crushed, Antonius went to his
</p>
<p>province of Macedonia, where he continued for two years, but, on his
</p>
<p>return to Rome, he was brought to trial, and banished, for having been
</p>
<p>guilty of extortion, and having made war beyond the limits of his pro-
</p>
<p>vince, (Liv. Epit. 103.) He was a man of very dissolute habits, and
</p>
<p>belore he obtained the consulship had been expelled by the censors from
</p>
<p>the senate for immoral conduct.
</p>
<p>Aspar. A Numidian, sent to the court of Bocchus by Jugurtha, to
</p>
<p>obtain secret information respecting the intentions of the Mauretanian
</p>
<p>king with respect to himself and the Roman people. He was outwitted
</p>
<p>by Bocchus and Sylla, and the immediate consequence was the capture
</p>
<p>of Jugurtha.
</p>
<p>Aurelia Orestilla. A female of great beauty, but very corrupt prin-
</p>
<p>ciples. Catiline offered her his hand in marriage, which she refused to
</p>
<p>accept, because he had a son by a former marriage, arrived at man's
</p>
<p>estate. To remove this obstacle Catiline put his son to death by ad-
</p>
<p>ministering poison. (Compare Val. Max. 9, 1.)
</p>
<p>Autronius, P. A Roman of senatorian rank, who became consul
</p>
<p>elect, but afterwards lost the consulship on a charge of bribery. The
</p>
<p>consequent disgrace in which this involved him led him very probably to
</p>
<p>join the party of Catiline. After the overthrow of that party he succeeded
</p>
<p>in making his escape.

</p>
<p>Bellienus, L. The Roman praetor at Utica, whom Marius summoned
</p>
<p>to attend a council at Cirta, towards the end of the Jugurthine war.
</p>
<p>According to some he was the maternal uncle of Catiline.
</p>
<p>Bestia, L. Calpurnius. A Roman nobleman, who held the consulship
</p>
<p>with Scipio Nasica, B. C. 113. It fell to his lot to carry on the war in
</p>
<p>Numidia against Jugurtha, where, however, he acquired no fame, but
</p>
<p>was led by his avaricious feelings to receive a heavy bribe, and conclude
</p>
<p>a disadvantageous and dishonourable peace with Jugurtha. He was
</p>
<p>condemned under the Mamilian law, and died in exile. Besides the
</p>
<p>charges brought against him by Sallust, Pliny the elder mentions that
</p>
<p>M. Caecilius brought him to trial for poisoning at least two of his wives
</p>
<p>by wolfsbane.
</p>
<p>Bocchus. King of Mauretania, who betrayed Jugurtha into the hand^
</p>
<p>of the Romans. He obtained as the reward of his treachery the western
</p>
<p>part of Numidia,

<p>Bomilcar. An officer in the army of Jugurtha, to whom he entrusted
</p>
<p>secret and important business. He conspired along with Nabdalsa
</p>
<p>against his master, but the plot was discovered and he lost his life.
</p>
<p>Brutus, D. Junius. The husband of Sempronia. His residence was
</p>
<p>near the forum, and into it Umbrenus took the ambassadors of the Allo-
</p>
<p>broges, and discovered to them the conspiracy of Catiline. From
</p>
<p>Sallust's mentioning that the meeting was held in his house when Brutus
</p>
<p>was from home, the presumption is that he had no knowledge of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy ; although his wife Sempronia was an accomplice.
</p>
<p>C.
</p>
<p>Caesar, C. Julius. Son of Caius Caesar, and Aurelia the daughter of
</p>
<p>Cotta. He was born in the sixth consulship of Marius, B. C. 99. When
</p>
<p>only in his seventeenth year, he obtained the office of Flamen Dialis or
</p>
<p>High-priest of Jupiter. His marriage with Cornelia, the daughter of Cinna,
</p>
<p>excited against him the hatred of Sylla, whose suspicion he had previously
</p>
<p>incurred from his aunt Julia's being the wife of Marius. He with difficult) 7
</p>
<p>escaped assassination, and it was only at the intercession of the vestal
</p>
<p>virgins, and in consequence of the entreaties of his relations, that Sylla
</p>
<p>spared his life. The latter, indeed, had the discernment to behold in
</p>
<p>him, even when a mere youth, the germes of future talent and ambition,
</p>
<p>and when he was asked by his friends why he was so anxious to put a
</p>
<p>mere boy to death, his answer w T as, " In that boy, I see many Mariuses."
</p>
<p>Of the eventful life of this eminent Roman, it will only be necessary here
</p>
<p>to speak so far as it was connected with the conspiracy of Catiline. His
</p>
<p>principal aim, in the accomplishment of his ambitious schemes, was to
</p>
<p>gain the favour of the populace, and weaken the power of the nobility.
</p>
<p>This brought him at once in contact with Catiline, and, in favouring the
</p>
<p>views of that daring conspirator, his object was to destroy by these
</p>
<p>means the liberty of his country, and then to crush the conspirators
</p>
<p>themselves, and make himself master of Rome. The opinion which
</p>
<p>he gave in the senate, with respect to the punishment of Lentulus,
</p>
<p>Cethegus, and the other accomplices of Catiline ; the threatening con-
</p>
<p>duct of the Roman equites, who guarded the temple where the senate

<p>Catilina, L. Sergius. A Roman of patrician rank, and the last of
</p>
<p>the gens Sergia. Of his father and grandfather little is known. The
</p>
<p>former would seem to have been in indigent circumstances, from the
</p>
<p>language of Quintus Cicero, (de Pet. Cons. c. 2,) who speaks of Cati-
</p>
<p>line, as having been born amid the poverty ^f his father. The great
</p>
<p>grandfather, M. Sergius Silus, or Silo, distinguished himself greatly in
</p>
<p>the second Punic war, and was present in the battles of Ticinus, Trebia,
</p>
<p>Trasymenus, and Cannae. Pliny {H. N. 7, 29) speaks of his exploits
</p>
<p>in a very animated strain.  The cruelty of Catiline's disposition, his un-
</p>
<p>daunted resolution, and the depravity of his morals, fitted him for acting
</p>
<p>distinguished part in the turbulent and bloody scenes of the period in

<p>bounds. He rejoiced, in the carnage and plunder of the proscribed, grat-
</p>
<p>ifying at one time his own private resentments, by bringing his enemies
</p>
<p>to punishment, and executing at another the bloody mandates of the
</p>
<p>dictator himself. Many citizens of noble birth are said to have fallen
</p>
<p>by his hand, and, according to Plutarch, (Vit. Syll. c. 32.  Vit. Cic.
</p>
<p>c. 10,) he had assassinated his own brother during the civil war, and
</p>
<p>now, to screen himself from prosecution, persuaded Sylla to put him
</p>
<p>down among the proscribed, as a person still alive. He murdered, too,
</p>
<p>with his own hands, his sister's husband, a Roman knight, of a mild and
</p>
<p>peaceable character. One of the most horrid actions, however, of which
</p>
<p>he was guilty, would seem to have been the killing of M. Marius Grati-
</p>
<p>dianus, a near relation of the celebrated Marius. Sylla had put the name
</p>
<p>of this individual on the list of the proscribed, whereupon Catiline en-
</p>
<p>tered the dwelling of the unfortunate man, exhausted upon his person
</p>
<p>all the refinements of cruelty and insult, and having at length put an end
</p>
<p>to his existence, carried his bloody head in triumph through the streets
</p>
<p>of Rome, and brought it to Sylla, as he sat on his tribunal in the forum.
</p>
<p>When this was done, the murderer washed his hands in the lustral water
</p>
<p>at the door of Apollo's temple, which stood in the immediate vicinity. 
</p>
<p>Catiline was peculiarly dangerous and formidable, as his power of dis-
</p>
<p>simulation enabled him to throw a veil over his vices. Such was his
</p>
<p>art, that, while he was poisoning the minds of the Roman youth, he gained
</p>
<p>the friendship and esteem of the severe Catulus. The remainder of his
</p>
<p>career is detailed in the pages ef Sallust, and will not need repetition here.
</p>
<p>Cato, M. Porcius, surnamed Uticensis, on account of his having de-
</p>
<p>stroyed himself at Utica, was the great grandson of Cato the Censor.
</p>
<p>His parents died when he was very young, and he was educated under
</p>
<p>the roof of his mother's brother, Livius Drusus. He was austere in his
</p>
<p>morals, a strict follower of the tenets of the Stoic sect ; and so great a
</p>
<p>lover of what was virtuous and right, as to pursue every object of such a
</p>
<p>nature with undeviating steadiness, regardless of the difficulties which
</p>
<p>he might have to encounter, or of the dangers to which he might be tx-
</p>
<p>posed. Cato exerted himself, though in vain, to stem the torrent of
</p>
<p>Roman luxury and corruption, and in his own person he copied the sim

</p>
<p>plicity of earlier days. He often appeared barefooted in public, and
</p>
<p>never travelled but on foot. In whatever office he was employed, he
</p>
<p>always reformed its abuses, and restored the ancient regulations. To the
</p>
<p>qualities of a virtuous man, and the rectitude of a stern patriot, Cato
</p>
<p>added the intrepidity of a brave soldier and the talents of an able general.
</p>
<p>In the affair of the conspiracy, he gave Cicero his constant and vigorous
</p>
<p>support, and it was chiefly through his efforts, in opposition to those of
</p>
<p>Caesar, that the accomplices of Catiline were capitally punished. This
</p>
<p>virtuous Roman put an end to his existence at Utica, after the defeat of
</p>
<p>Juba and Scipio by Caesar, in the battle of Thapsus.
</p>
<p>Catulus, Q. Lutatius. A noble Roman, conspicuous both for
</p>
<p>his love of country and his private virtues. He was the colleague of
</p>
<p>Marius in the consulship when the Cimbri and Teutones came down
</p>
<p>upon the south of Europe, and was engaged with that commander in
</p>
<p>the bloody battle of the Raudii Campi, where the Cimbri were so sig-
</p>
<p>nally defeated by the Romans. We afterwards find him censor with
</p>
<p>Crassus ; and, subsequently to this, opposing Crassus's attempt to make
</p>
<p>Egypt tributary. Catulus was in politics on the aristocratic side, and
</p>

<p>M" course a warm opponent of Julius Caesar. He was competitor also
</p>
<p>with the latter for the office of pontifex, but unsuccessful in his applica-
</p>
<p>tion. At a later period he obtained the consulship along with M.
</p>
<p>Aemilius Lepidus, B. C. 80, and ten years after this he dedicated the
</p>
<p>temple of Jupiter in the capitol, which had been destroyed by fire. The
</p>
<p>character of Catulus stood deservedly high. A stranger to flattery and
</p>
<p>adulation, he reproved with equal openness the levity of the multitude,
</p>
<p>and the misconduct of the senate. An anecdote is related of him by
</p>
<p>Plutarch, which proves conclusively the estimation in which he was held.
</p>
<p>When it was proposed to invest Pompey with extraordinary power, under
</p>
<p>the Manilian law, for the suppression of the pirates, Catulus opposed the
</p>
<p>step, and one of his arguments was, that the people ought not to expose
</p>
<p>such a man to so many dangers as he was likely to incur in this new
</p>
<p>commandj " for," added he, " what other will you have if you lose him I 1-
</p>
<p>With one voice the assembled people exclaimed, " Yourself." After a
</p>
<p>long life of honourable usefulness, Catulus was compelled to put an end
</p>
<p>to his days, by order of the sanguinary Marius. In order to effect this,
</p>
<p>he shut himself up in a narrow chamber, newly plastered, and suffocated
</p>
<p>himself by the vapour produced by a large fire.
</p>
<p>Cethegus, C. Cornelius. A Roman of corrupt morals and turbulent
</p>
<p>character. He filled, at one time, the office of tribune, and was also a
</p>
<p>warm partisan of Sylla, after having originally sided with Marius. Sub-
</p>
<p>sequently, however, losing the influence which he had possessed, he
</p>
<p>joined in the conspiracy of Catiline. Cicero informs us, that in rash-
</p>
<p>ness and daring he surpassed Catiline himself, and almost equalled him
</p>
<p>in strength of body, love of arms, and dignity of birth. In arranging
</p>
<p>the details of the plot, the conspirators assigned to Cethegus the task of
</p>
<p>posting himself at the door of Cicero's bouse, and, after he had forced
</p>
<p>an entrance, of murdering that illustrious Roman. The vigilance of Cicero
</p>
<p>frustrated this design. Cethegus was apprehended along with Lentulus
</p>
<p>and the rest, and strangled in prison.
</p>
<p>Cicero, M. Tullius. An eminent and well-known Roman, born at
</p>
<p>Arpinum, a town of the Yolsci, ki Latium, B. C. 107. His father
</p>
<p>although of equestrian rank, had never enjoyed any curule office, and,

</p>
<p>on that account, Cicero frequently calls himself " a new man," (norms
</p>
<p>homo,) as having been the first of his family who had raised himself to
</p>
<p>such a magistracy. After a careful education, in the completion of
</p>
<p>which he travelled over many parts of Greece, Cicero entered on the
</p>
<p>career of office, and it was his peculiar boast, to have obtained each pre-
</p>
<p>ferment in succession in its own proper year, or, in other words, as soon
</p>
<p>as he was eligible to it. Thus, he obtained the quaestorship at thirty-
</p>
<p>one years of age, the aedileship at thirty-seven, the praetorship at forty,
</p>
<p>and the consulship at forty-three. Our limits will compel us to confine
</p>
<p>ourselves merely to that part of Cicero's history which was connected with
</p>
<p>the conspiracy of Catiline, and only to so much even of this as Sallust
</p>
<p>himself has not touched upon. It was a master stroke of policy on the
</p>
<p>part of Cicero to drive Catiline out of Rome, and force him, as it were,
</p>
<p>into a rebellion before it was ripe, m the hope, that, by carrying out with
</p>
<p>him his accomplices, he would clear the eity at once of the whole faction ;
</p>
<p>or, by leaving them behind, without his counsels to guide them, would
</p>
<p>expose them to sure destruction by their own rashness and folly. For
</p>
<p>Catiline's chief trust was not on the open force which he had provided

</p>
<p>for the field, but on the success of his secret machinations at Rome, and
</p>
<p>on making himself master of the city.  While the sense of all his im-
</p>
<p>portant services was still fresh, Cicero was repaid with the most ample
</p>
<p>honours. L. Gellius, moreover, who had been consul and censor, said
</p>
<p>in a speech to the senate, that the republic owed him a civic crown,
</p>
<p>" for having saved them all from ruin," and Catulus, in a full house, de-
</p>
<p>clared him " the father of his country," as Cato did likewise from the
</p>
<p>rostra, with the loud acclamations of the whole people. Party feelings,
</p>
<p>however, eventually gained the ascendency, and the very man who had
</p>
<p>been thus idolized was impeached for putting citizens to death without
</p>
<p>the formality of a trial, and was compelled to yield to the coming storm,
</p>
<p>and retire into voluntary banishment. The individual most active against
</p>
<p>him was Publius Clodius. The charge against him had reference to the
</p>
<p>summary punishment inflicted by him, in accordance with the orders of
</p>
<p>the senate, on Lentulus, Cethegus, and their associates. Cicero display-
</p>
<p>ed a great want of firmness in exile, his fortitude deserted him, and his
</p>
<p>spirits sunk in deep depression. By the exertions of Pompey and the
</p>
<p>efforts of his other friends, aided by the active co-operation of the senate,
</p>
<p>he was finally recalled. The senate decreed their thanks to all the
</p>
<p>cities which had treated with respect the illustrious exile, and ordered his
</p>
<p>town and country houses, which Clodius had destroyed, to be rebuilt at
</p>
<p>the public expense. Such multitudes accompanied him from his landing,
</p>
<p>that he says, Italy carried him on her shoulders to Rome, an expression,
</p>
<p>which Plutarch considers actually short of the truth.
</p>
<p>Cinna, L. Cornelius. A Roman nobleman of considerable influence
</p>
<p>and personal bravery. He was consul with Cn. Octavius, B. C. 91, but
</p>
<p>was deprived by his colleague of his consular authority, and driven by
</p>
<p>him out of the city, because he had by force procured the enactment of
</p>
<p>several injurious laws. Obtaining possession of the army of Appius
</p>
<p>Claudius, he declared war on the government, and called to his assist-
</p>
<p>ance Marius and other exiles from Africa. Cinna and Marius eventually
</p>
<p>triumphed, Rome opened her gates, and the most cruel excesses were
</p>
<p>committed by the victors. All the leading men of the party of Sylla
</p>
<p>were put to death, and their property confiscated. Cinna and Marius

</p>
<p>then declared themselves consuls, and the latter died on the very first
</p>
<p>day of his entering upon office. L. Valerius Flaccus succeeded him.
</p>
<p>In his third and fourth consulships Cinna had Cn. Papirius Carbo foi
</p>
<p>his colleague, with whom he made preparations for a war against Sylla,
</p>
<p>who was then engaged in the operations against Mithridates. During
</p>
<p>the fourth consulship of Cinna, Julius Caesar married his daughter Cor-
</p>
<p>nelia. Cinna eventually, after raising a powerful armament against
</p>
<p>Sylla, was killed by his own men, on a rumour of his having put Pompey,
</p>
<p>then quite a young man, to death.
</p>
<p>Coeparius, Q. A native of Terracina, and accomplice in the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy of Catiline. He was preparing to set out for Apulia, to rouse
</p>
<p>and arm the slaves against the state, at the time the conspiracy was dis-
</p>
<p>covered. Having learned that the plot was detected, he fled from Rome,
</p>
<p>before the officers sent by the consuls to apprehend him arrived at his
</p>
<p>Douse, but was afterwards taken and strangled in prison.
</p>
<p>Cornelius, C. A Roman knight, connected with the conspiracy of
</p>
<p>Catiline, who undertook, in conjunction with L. Vargunteius, to murder
</p>
<p>Cicero the consul, at his own home.

</p>
<p>Oornificius, Q. A Roman, to whose custody Cethegus was com-
</p>
<p>mitted, before he suffered punishment.
</p>
<p>Crassus, M. Licinius. A celebrated Roman, surnamed the " Rich,'
</p>
<p>on account of his great opulence. At first he was very circumscribed in
</p>
<p>his circumstances, but by educating slaves, and selling them for a high
</p>
<p>price, he soon enriched himself. Crassus distinguished himself in the
</p>
<p>war against Spartacus, by defeating that gladiator and killing 12000 of
</p>
<p>his followers. After this, he was chosen consul with Pompey, and, aftei
</p>
<p>the cDnsulship, obtained the office of censor. His supposed participation
</p>
<p>n is& conspiracy of Catiline was probably without any foundation in
</p>
<p>truth. What purpose could Crassus, in fact, propose to himself by en-
</p>
<p>tering into a plot to burn a city, in which his own property was so consid-
</p>
<p>erable \ The enmity which arose between Cicero and Crassus, in con-
</p>
<p>sequence of the alleged guilt of the latter, was so bitter, that, according
</p>
<p>to Plutarch, it would have shown itself by some act of violence on the
</p>
<p>part of Crassus, had not his son Publius, who was very intimate with
</p>
<p>Cicero, prevented him. He even prevailed on his father, eventually, to
</p>
<p>become reconciled to the orator. Crassus became afterwards a member
</p>
<p>of the first triumvirate ; and, obtaining Syria for his province, marched
</p>
<p>against the Parthians, by whom he was defeated and slain.
</p>
<p>Curius, Q. A Roman of good family, whose disgraceful and im-
</p>
<p>moral conduct had caused his expulsion by the censors from the senate.
</p>
<p>He was connected with the conspiracy, but divulged the secret of such
</p>
<p>a conspiracy's having been formed, to Fulvia, a female of high rank,
</p>
<p>with whom he was intimate. Fulvia communicated the danger which
</p>
<p>threatened the state and the lives of the citizens ; and the alarm which
</p>
<p>this occasioned caused the election of Cicero to the consulship. Cicero
</p>
<p>subsequently prevailed upon Curius, through the means of Fulvia, to
</p>
<p>discover to him all the movements of Catiline, and was thus enabled to
</p>
<p>baffle his schemes. In return for these services, rewards were voted
</p>
<p>him from the public funds ; but Caesar, whom Curius had named among
</p>
<p>the conspirators, exerted himself against the fulfilment of the public
</p>
<p>promise, and the rewards were not given.

<p>of Bocchus. He was employed by that monarch in the negotiations

<p>with Sylla, respecting the seizure of Jugurtha.
</p>
<p>Damasippus. A praetor during the consulship of Papirius Carbo, and
</p>
<p>the younger Marius. As a follower of the Marian party, he indulged in
</p>
<p>many cruel excesses against the opposite faction, and also against such
</p>
<p>as were suspected of favouring it. He assembled the senate undei
</p>
<p>the pretence of business, and then massacred a number of the leading
</p>
<p>noblemen, alleging that they were in the interest of Sylla. (B. C. 84.)
</p>
<p>Sylla, when he gained the ascendency, ordered him to be slain.

</p>
<p>patronage over the state of the Allobroges, on which account their
</p>
<p>deputies at Rome disclosed to him the conspiracy of Catiline. He im-
</p>
<p>mediately communicated, the information to Cicero.
</p>
<p>FiguluSj C. Marcius. A Roman, who held the consulship with Julius
</p>
<p>Caesar, B. C. 66. During this year Catiline formed his plan for the
</p>
<p>overthrow of the government.
</p>
<p>Flamma, C. Flaminius. A Roman with whom Catiline passed a few
</p>
<p>days, at his residence in the territory of Arretium, after the conspiracy
</p>
<p>had been discovered at Rome, and while he was supplying with arms
</p>
<p>the inhabitants of the vicinity.
</p>
<p>Fulvia. A Roman female of high rank, but corrupt principles. Cicero,
</p>
<p>through her means, obtained from Curius secret information of all the
</p>
<p>movements of the conspirators.
</p>
<p>FulvIus, A. The son of a Roman senator, who left Rome to join
</p>
<p>the army of Catiline, but was arrested on the way, brought back to the
</p>
<p>city, and put to death by command of his parent.
</p>
<p>Flaccus, M. Fulvius. A Roman, who was consul a 4 ong with M.
</p>
<p>Plautius Hypsaeus, B. C. 127. He joined the party of Caius Gracchus,
</p>
<p>and was killed by the consul Opimius, in the tumultuary movements

<p>attendant on the passage of the Agrarian law. His house was levelled
</p>

</p>
<p>Gauda. A Numidian, of noble extraction, son of Mastanabal, and
</p>
<p>grandson of Masinissa, whom Micipsa had named as heir to the crown
</p>
<p>of Numidia, in case his more immediate descendants should not survive
</p>
<p>to enjoy it. He became weakened in mind by a severe bodily sickness,
</p>
<p>and a tool in the hands of Marius, for the prosecution of his ambitious
</p>
<p>schemes in supplanting Metellus.
</p>
<p>Gracchi. There were two brothers of this name, Tiberius Gracchus
</p>
<p>and Caius Gracchus, sons of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, and of Cor-
</p>
<p>nelia, the daughter of Scipio Africanus. Tiberius the elder, was of a
</p>
<p>mild and unruffled temper, but Caius, violent and irascible. The object
</p>
<p>of the two brothers, in succession, was to have the public lands divided
</p>
<p>among the citizens. Appian says, that the nobles and rich men, partly
</p>
<p>by getting possession of the public lands, partly by buying up the shares
</p>
<p>of indigent ownei;j bad made themselves masters of all the lands in

<p>italv, and had thus, by degrees, accomplished the removal of the com-
</p>
<p>mon people from their possessions. This abuse stimulated Tiberius
</p>
<p>Sracchus to revive the Licinian law, by which no one could hold more
</p>
<p>than 500 jugera, or about 350 acres of land. The owners, however,
</p>
<p>were to be indemnified for the land they had thus lost. The attempts
</p>
<p>of the Gracchi cost them their lives. Tiberius was slain in a collision
</p>
<p>between his adherents and the party of the nobility headed by Scipio
</p>
<p>Nasica. Caius was slain some years afterwards by the consul Opimius
</p>
<p>and his party.
</p>
<p>Gulussa. Second son of Masinissa. Livy makes him to have re-
</p>
<p>ceived a third of the kingdom, on the death of his father. (Epit. 50.)
</p>
<p>Sallust, however, states, that both Gulussa and Mastanabal were cut
</p>
<p>off by disease, before their father died ; and that Micipsa, the remaining
</p>
<p>brother, on the demise of his father, succeeded to the whole kingdom.
</p>
<p>In the third Punic war, Gulussa contributed to the conquest of the Car-
</p>
<p>thaginians, and the destruction of their state.

</p>
<p>Hannibal. Son of Hamilcar, the celebrated general of Carthage.
</p>
<p>He is only once casually alluded to by Sallust.

</p>
<p>sassinated by persons employed for that purpose by Jugurtha.

<p>Jugurtha. Son of Mastanabal. His history is given in full by Sallust,

</p>
<p>of M. Porcius Laeca, tribune of the commons, who had the law carried

</p>
<p>substituting, for capital punishment, banishment and confiscation of

</p>
<p>torship, the usual step for being again restored to that body, when
</p>
<p>Catiline formed his design of subverting the government. Poverty, the
</p>
<p>natural consequence of excessive dissipation, added to immoderate vanity
</p>
<p>and extravagant ambition, induced him to join in the conspiracy. The
</p>
<p>soothsayers easily persuaded him that he was the third of the gens Cor-
</p>
<p>nelia, destined by the fates to enjoy the supreme power at Rome. L.
</p>
<p>Cornelius Cinna, and L. Cornelius Sylla, had both attained to that ele-
</p>
<p>vation. His schemes, however, all proved abortive, and he was strangled
</p>
<p>in prison with the other conspirators who had been arrested. Plutarch
</p>
<p>informs us, that he received the surname of Sura, in consequence of his
</p>
<p>having wasted a large sum of the public money in his quaestorship under
</p>
<p>Sylla, who, enraged at his conduct, demanded a statement of his ac-
</p>
<p>counts in the senate, when Lentulus, with the utmost indifference, de
</p>
<p>clared he had no accounts to produce, and contemptuously presented
</p>
<p>to him the calf of his leg, {sura.) Among the Romans, particularly
</p>
<p>among the boys, the player at tennis, who missed his stroke, presented
</p>
<p>the calf of his leg to receive as a punishment a certain number of blows
</p>
<p>upon it. Lentulus, in allusion to that game, acted in the manner just
</p>
<p>described, which accounts for the surname, or rather nickname, of
</p>
<p>Sura.

<p>Lepidus, L. Aemilius, or L. Aemilius Lepidus Paullus, called by Sal-
</p>

</p>
<p>who formed with Augustus and Mark Antony the second triumvirate,
</p>
<p>[n early life he commenced a prosecution against Catiline, under the
</p>
<p>Plautian law. He held the consulship with C. Claudius Marcellus, B. C.
</p>
<p>52, the year that the censors expelled Sallust from the senate. He
</p>
<p>perished in the conscription of the triumvirate, being left to his fate by

<p>his own brother.

</p>
<p>meanors.

<p>Manlius, C. One of the accomplices of Catiline, whom the latter
</p>
<p>sent into Etruria to levy troops, and adopt whatever measures he might
</p>
<p>deem necessary for the success of the conspiracy. He commanded the
</p>
<p>right wing of Catiline's army in the final encounter, and fell fighting
</p>
<p>with the greatest bravery in the foremost ranks. Manlius had held a
</p>
<p>commission in the army of Sylla, under whom he had acquired con-

</p>
<p>he soon squandered away. He engaged in the conspiracy to retrieve his
</p>
<p>ruined fortunes.
</p>
<p>Manlius, M. A Roman commander, who held the consulship with
</p>
<p>P. Rutilius Rufus, B. C. 107. He was defeated by the Gauls that same
</p>
<p>year. Cicero (Pro Plane. 5) calls him Cn. Manlius, and Eutropius (5. 1;
</p>
<p>Manius Manilius.
</p>
<p>Manlius Torquatus, L. A Roman commander, who held the con-
</p>
<p>sulship with L. Aurelius Ootta, 67 B. C. He was the particular friend
</p>
<p>of Cicero, who mentions him in terms of high approbation in his letters.
</p>
<p>Sallust calls him L. Torquatus.
</p>
<p>Marcius Rex, Q. Consul with L. Caecilius Metellus, B. C. 80.
</p>
<p>When Catiline, five years after, formed his conspiracy, Q. Marcius Rex
</p>
<p>was sent to Faesulae, to levy troops, and adopt such other measures as
</p>
<p>he might deem proper. He had just returned from a military com-
</p>
<p>mand, had demanded a triumph, and met with opposition from a few
</p>
<p>unprincipled men in the senate. The Marcian family claimed descent
</p>
<p>from Ancus Marcius, and hence the name Marcius Rex.
</p>
<p>Marius, C. A native of Arpinum, remarkable for his military talents,
</p>
<p>but still more for his cruel and vindictive disposition. Having preserved
</p>
<p>the state by his bravery, he afterwards brought it to the brink of ruin by
</p>
<p>his reckless and uncompromising violence. In early life, he was a
</p>
<p>ploughman, and wrought for hire. Quittmg that employment, he entered
</p>
<p>the ranks of the army, and distinguished himself under Scipio at the
</p>
<p>siege and capture of Numantia. From the condition of a common sol-
</p>
<p>dier, he gradually rose to the command of the Roman army, and to the
</p>
<p>office of consul. After bringing the war with Jugurtha to a close, he
</p>
<p>defeated m two terrible encounters the Teutones and Cimbri, slaying
</p>
<p>an immense number, and taking a vast multitude prisoners. After these
</p>
<p>signal victories, his ambitious feelings brought him in collision with Sylla,
</p>
<p>and a desolating civil war was the consequence. To crush the power
</p>
<p>of his rival, Sylla marched the troops which he had raised to carry on
</p>
<p>the war with Mithridates to Rome, and compelled Marius to flee. In
</p>
<p>his banishment he underwent uncommon hardships, from which he was

<p>m the end released by China's embracing his interests. He then re-
</p>
<p>turned to Rome to satiate his inhuman resentment, and butchered many
</p>
<p>thousands of the citizens. Tired at last with murder and assassination,
</p>
<p>he and Cinna appointed themselves consuls. But Marius, worn out by
</p>
<p>infirmities, age, and excessive intoxication, to which he probably had
</p>
<p>recourse to blunt the stings of a guilty conscience, died on the first day
</p>
<p>of his being invested with the consulship for the seventh time.
</p>
<p>Massinissa. Son of Gala, king of the Massyli, in Numidia. He was
</p>
<p>brought up at Carthage, where he'eontracted friendships with the nobles,
</p>
<p>and embraced the interests of the state. As an ally of the Carthaginians,
</p>
<p>he waged a successful war against Syphax. He afterwards crossed
</p>
<p>over into Spain, still on the side of Carthage, and distinguished himself
</p>
<p>by his bravery, activity, and military skill. After Scipio, surnamed
</p>
<p>Africanus Major, had defeated As drub al in this country, he found, among
</p>
<p>.he prisoners of war, one of the nephews of Massinissa. The Roman
</p>
<p>sommandar sent this relative, loaded with presents, to his uncle, and
</p>
<p>gave him an escort for the safety of his person. Struck by this act of
</p>
<p>generosity, Massinissa forgot all former feelings of hostility, and joined

<p>his forces to those of Scipio. From this time, he continued a firm and
</p>
<p>faithfulJally to his new friends, and it was to his exertions that the Romans
</p>
<p>owed many of their victories in Africa, and particularly the one which
</p>
<p>proved so fatal to Asdrubal and Syphax. In the battle of Zama also,
</p>
<p>Massinissa greatly contributed to the overthrow of Hannibal, and the
</p>
<p>Romans rewarded his fidelity by large accessions of territory. He at-
</p>
<p>tained to an advanced age, in the enjoyment of excellent health, and, on
</p>
<p>his death, left his kingdom to be divided by the younger Scipio among
</p>
<p>his three sons, Micipsa, Gulussa, and Manastabal. One circumstance in
</p>
<p>the life of Massinissa is worthy of particular attention from its tragical
</p>
<p>nature. He had become possessed of Sophonisba, the captive wife of
</p>
<p>Syphax, to whom he had been attached in earlier days, and having car-
</p>
<p>ried her to his camp, he married her. But this step displeasing the
</p>
<p>Roman commander, fhe monarch sent her a cup of poison which she
</p>
<p>readily drank, and expired, while Massinissa abandoned himself to the
</p>
<p>deepest sorrow.
</p>
<p>Memmius, C. A tribune of the commons, and violent foe to the
</p>
<p>power of the nobility. He exerted himself powerfully and with great
</p>
<p>success in exposing the shameful bribery of Jugurtha, and arousing the
</p>
<p>commons to an assertion of their rights. He lost his life in a canvass
</p>
<p>for the consulship, (B. C. 102,) having been slain by L. Apuleius Satur-
</p>
<p>ninus, a tribune, from an apprehension that he would oppose him in his
</p>
<p>evil actions. Memmius fell under repeated strokes, by the bludgeons of
</p>
<p>lured assassins in the very midst of the assembly. Sallnst speaks in
</p>
<p>strong terms of his eloquence, though Cicero does not allow him a high
</p>
<p>i'ank among Roman orators.
</p>
<p>Metellus, Q. Caecilius, surnamed Numidicus, enjoyed the consul-
</p>
<p>ship with M. Junius Silanus, 111 B. C. He obtained Numidia as his
</p>
<p>province, and had nearly brought the war against Jugurtha to a close,
</p>
<p>by his military talents and incorruptible integrity, when he was removed
</p>
<p>from the command by the intrigues of Marius. For defeating Jugurtha
</p>
<p>and desolating Numidia, Metellus received the surname of Numidicus,
</p>
<p>aad according to Eutropius (4, 27) a triumph. Some time after this,
</p>
<p>he was summoned to trial by Saturninus, a tribune, for having refused

<p>to swear to observe the Agrarian law, which this individual had carrier'
</p>
<p>by force ; and, although all the good citizens supported him, he went, ir
</p>
<p>order to prevent any commotion, into voluntary exile at Rhodes. Marius
</p>
<p>pronounced sentence of banishment against him, B. C. 104, two year?
</p>
<p>after which, however, he was honourably recalled.
</p>
<p>Metellus, Q. Caecilius, surnamed Celer, filled the office of praetoi
</p>
<p>during the consulship of Cicero, and levied troops against Catiline. Or
</p>
<p>the expiration of his praetorship, he obtained the province of Cisalpine
</p>
<p>Gaul, and subsequently held the consulship with L. Afranius. He mar-
</p>
<p>ried Clodia, the sister of P. Clodius, and lost his life by poison admin-
</p>
<p>istered by this abandoned woman. Cicero praises his eloquence and
</p>
<p>his political integrity, and he is mentioned also by Horace (Od. 2 1.)
</p>
<p>H3 was surnamed Celer, according to Plutarch, from the quickness with
</p>
<p>which he celebrated funeral games in memory of his father, within a few
</p>
<p>days only after that parent's decease.
</p>
<p>Metellus, Q. surnamed Creticus, was consul B. C. 70, along with
</p>
<p>Q. Hortensius. On the expiration of his consulship, he obtained, as
</p>
<p>proconsul, the island of Crete for his province, and reduced it beneath

<p>He was honoured beside this with a triumph, notwithstanding the opposi-

</p>
<p>Micipsa. Eldest son of Massinissa, who succeeded to the throne of
</p>
<p>Numidia on the death of his brothers Gulussa and Manastabal, having
</p>
<p>previously to this enjoyed only the one third part of the kingdom as his
</p>
<p>share. Very little is known of the character of this monarch. He
</p>
<p>left two sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, and Jugurtha as a third ty
</p>
<p>adoption.
</p>
<p>Minucius Rufus, M. was consul with Sp. Postumius Albinus, B. C
</p>
<p>112. He obtained Macedonia for his province, and carried on a suc-
</p>
<p>cessful war against the Thracians, conquering the Scordisci and Treballi
</p>
<p>in Macedonia. Sallust calls him Quintus, while in Livy and in the con
</p>
<p>sular calendar he is named Marcus.
</p>
<p>Mithridates. A celebrated king of Pontus, in Asia Minor, sur
</p>
<p>named Eupator, and the seventh in succession. He was distinguished
</p>
<p>for his personal bravery and military talents, and for the long resistance
</p>
<p>which he made against the armies of Rome. At last, however, being
</p>
<p>deserted by his allies, betrayed by his son Pharnaces, and frequently
</p>
<p>defeated by the Romans, he was, at his own request, slain by a Gaul,
</p>
<p>that he might not fall into the hands of his enemies. The constitution
</p>
<p>of this monarch was so fortified by antidotes, of many of which he is
</p>
<p>said to have been the inventor, that the strongest and most active poisons
</p>
<p>had no effect upon him. The true form of the name appears to be Mith-
</p>
<p>radates, although the other is sanctioned by custom.
</p>
<p>Murena, Licinius, C. brother of the Licinius Murena, who was con-
</p>
<p>sul B. C. 62, and whom Cicero defended. C. Murena was deputy
</p>
<p>governor (legatus) of Transalpine Gaul when Catiline's conspiracy broke
</p>
<p>out, and secured a number of the malcontents who were endeavouring
</p>
<p>to excite commotions in his province.

<p>Nero, Tiberius Claudius. A Roman nobleman, grandfather of the
</p>
<p>emperor Tiberius Claudius Nero. When the conspiracy of Catiline was
</p>
<p>discovered, and the matter was debated in the senate, Nero moved that
</p>
<p>the guards on duty should be strengthened, and the whole affair dis-
</p>
<p>cussed more fully at a second meeting of that body. This motion very
</p>
<p>probably was intended to produce a unanimous sentence, with the view
</p>
<p>of giving time to the parties to come to an agreement, abating, perhaps,
</p>
<p>somewhat the severity of D. Junius Silanus, and adding to that of
</p>
<p>Caesar, the former having been in favour of death, the latter of confisca
</p>
<p>tion and banishment merely.

<p>Octavius Rufus, Cn. A Roman officer, who, during the Numidian
</p>
<p>war, brought over a supply of money to Africa. He must not be con-
</p>
<p>founded with the Octavius who held the consulship with Cinna B. C. 89,
</p>
<p>and who drove his colleague from the city, but was afterwards put to
</p>
<p>death by Cinna and Marius.
</p>
<p>Opimius, L. A Roman nobleman, who held the consulship with C.
</p>
<p>Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus, and who, while in that office, overpowered
</p>
<p>C. Sempronius Gracchus, the advocate of the Agrarian law. No fewer
</p>
<p>than three thousand persons were slain on this occasion, according to
</p>
<p>Plutarch, and along with Gracchus perished M. Fulvius Flaccus, a man
</p>
<p>of consular dignity. Opimius subsequently allowed himself to be bribed
</p>
<p>Dy Jugurtha, and, being brought to trial for this offence, was condemned,
</p>
<p>and went into banishment at Dyrrhachium, where he died in great
</p>
<p>poverty. The name of this individual has also descended to later times
</p>
<p>in another way. The wine made during his consulship was remarkable
</p>
<p>for having attained to a very great age, and was called Vinum Opimi-
</p>
<p>anum. There appears to have been an uncommon vintage during the
</p>
<p>year in which he was consul. Cicero states that he tasted some Opimian
</p>
<p>wine seventy-five years after ; and Pliny informs us, that it was still to
</p>
<p>be found when he wrote, at the distance of two hundred years, and that
</p>
<p>it had the appearance of candied honey.

<p>Perses. King of Macedonia. He was the son of Philip by a con-
</p>
<p>cubine, and therefore inferior to Demetrius, the legitimate son of that
</p>
<p>monarch. By a false accusation, however, he induced the monarch to
</p>
<p>put Demetrius to death. Philip, on being informed of the truth, resolved
</p>
<p>to disinherit Perses, and secure the crown to his youngest son Antigo-
</p>
<p>nus ; but his own death, which happened soon after, frustrated his design.
</p>
<p>One of the first acts of Perses on coming to the throne, was to put
</p>
<p>Antigonus to death, both because he had been intended as successor to
</p>
<p>Philip, and because it was through him that the innocence of Demetrius
</p>
<p>was made known. Becoming involved, however, in war with the Ro-

</p>
<p>who led him in triumph through the streets of Rome. He was afterwards
</p>
<p>sent as prisoner to Alba, where he ended his days. The Romans treated
</p>
<p>him with more kindness than he deserved, allowing him to retain his
</p>
<p>attendants, money, &c. With Perses fell the Macedonian empire. He

</p>
<p>the civil war, and, in conjunction with Afranius, endeavoured to make

<p>appear to have been both able commanders. After having been forced

</p>
<p>being defeated along with Juba, king of Mauretania, in the battle of

<p>Thapsus, he and that prince engaged purposely in single combat, that
</p>
<p>they might die an honourable death. Juba soon laid Petreius dead at

<p>his feet, and then, at his own request, fell by the hand of a slave.

<p>Pi so, Cn. A Roman of good family, but profligate and needy. The
</p>
<p>urgency of his wants, uniting with the depravity of his disposition, insti-
</p>
<p>gated him to any measure which had for its object the convulsion of the
</p>
<p>state, as the only remedy which could free him from difficulties and
</p>
<p>embarrassments. He readily entered into the conspiracy of Catiline,
</p>
<p>and, in the execution of the plot, he was at the head of an army to hold
</p>
<p>the Spaniards in subjection. The design transpired and necessarily
</p>
<p>prevented its execution. Soon after, although only quaestor, he ob-
</p>
<p>tained the government of Hither Spain, with the authority of propraetor,
</p>
<p>by the interest of Crassus, who wished to set him up in opposition to
</p>
<p>Pompey. The senate assented, in order to have so dangerous a citizen
</p>
<p>at a distance from the seat of government. The Spanish cavalry, which
</p>
<p>formed part of his train, assassinated him soon after his arrival in that

<p>country.

</p>
<p>Observations on the Greek Philosophers, and Orations on several topics
</p>
<p>Cicero mentions his eloquence with respect. He was also an able
</p>
<p>lawyer.
</p>
<p>Saenicjs, L. A Roman, who read in the senate a letter which he
</p>
<p>had received from Faesulae, containing intelligence, that Manlius, one
</p>
<p>of the accomplices of Catiline, had taken up arms against the state with
</p>
<p>a numerous party of followers.
</p>
<p>Scaurus, M. Aemilius. A Roman nobleman, of great ability, who
</p>
<p>held the consulship with M. Caecilius Metellus, B. C. 116. He tri-
</p>
<p>umphed over the Carni ; and made the road from Placentia to Parma,
</p>
<p>hence called the Aemilian way. He had the honour of being appointed
</p>
<p>Princeps Senatus, and would have ranked in history with the very first
</p>
<p>characters of the Roman state, had not his splendid talents been tarnished
</p>
<p>by avarice and other degrading passions. Pliny agrees with Sallust in
</p>
<p>giving the unfavourable side of the picture. On the other hand, Cicero
</p>
<p>highly extols his virtues, abilities, and achievements. It is of this same
</p>
<p>individual that Valerius Maximus (3, 7, 8) relates the well-known anec-
</p>
<p>dote, so illustrative of the high estimation in which he was held by the
</p>
<p>people. Being accused of having received a bribe from a foreign prince,
</p>
<p>he concluded a very brief defence with the following words :  " Varius
</p>
<p>Sucronensis Aemilium Scaurum, regia mercede corruptum, imperium
</p>
<p>populi Romani perdidisse ait : Aemilius Scaurus huic se affinem esse
</p>
<p>culpae negat. Utri creditis ?" The writer adds :  " Cujus dicti ad-
</p>
<p>miratione populus commotus Varium ah ilia dementissima actione per-
</p>
<p>tinaci clamor e depulit." It is more than probable, therefore, that Sal-
</p>
<p>lust endeavours to depreciate Scaurus, because the latter was a member,
</p>
<p>and a strong advocate for the power, of the nobility ; while Cicero, on

</p>
<p>the other hand, strives for this same reason to exalt his character. The
</p>
<p>truth undoubtedly lies between either extreme. He afterwards held
</p>
<p>the office of censor, and the consulship a second time. His name often
</p>
<p>occurs in the writings of Cicero, who speaks in great praise of a work
</p>
<p>of his in three books, recording the principal occurrences and trans-
</p>
<p>actions of his life. The orator considers it equal to Xenophon's Cyro-
</p>
<p>oaedia.

<p>Scipio, P. Cornelius, afterwards surnamed Africanus, from his vic-

<p>tory over Hannibal at Zama, and his consequent overthrow of the Car-
</p>
<p>thaginian power. He is only alluded to incidentally by Sallust.
</p>
<p>Scipio, P. Cornelius, surnamed Aemilianus, and also Africanus
</p>
<p>Minor. He was the son of Paullus Aemilius, the conqueror of Mace-
</p>
<p>donia, and was adopted into the Scipio line by the son of the elder
</p>
<p>Africanus. His name Aemilianus refers to his parentage, and that of

<p>thage at the close of the third Punic war. He is sometimes also styled
</p>
<p>Numantinus, from his having conquered Numantia.
</p>
<p>Scipio Nasica, P. Cornelius, married Metella, daughter of Q. Cae-
</p>
<p>cilius Metellus Macedonicus, Cicero, in his treatise on illustrious orators,
</p>
<p>mentions, that, in wit and humour, he surpassed all his contemporaries.
</p>
<p>He obtained the consulship, B. C. 113, with L. Calpurnius Piso Bestia,
</p>
<p>'when Italy fell to his lot, and Numidia to that of his colleague. He
</p>
<p><ktd in office, on which account Bestia returned from Numidia to preside
</p>
<p>it ihe elections.
</p>
<p>Sempeonia. The wife of Decimus Brutus, by whom she became the
</p>
<p>mother of D. Junius Brutus, so well known for the share he took in the
</p>
<p>assassination of Julius Caesar. She engaged in the conspiracy of Cati-
</p>
<p>line, without the knowledge, as it would appear, of her husband. Sallust
</p>
<p>has drawn her character in a very masterly manner, as that of a bold and
</p>
<p>unprincipled female.
</p>
<p>Silanus, Decimus Junius, held the office of consul with Licinius
</p>
<p>Murena, B. C, 64. They succeeded M. Tullius Cicero and C. Antonius.
</p>
<p>Being consuls elect, when the case of Catiline and his accomplices came
</p>
<p>Defore the senate, Silanus was asked his opinion first, with respect to the
</p>
<p>punishment that ought to be inflicted on these traitors. He was in favour
</p>
<p>of their being put to death. Subsequently, however, he embraced the
</p>
<p>opinion of Tiberius Nero, who was for strengthening the guards and
</p>
<p>adjourning the debate.
</p>
<p>Silanus, M. Junius. A Roman nobleman, who had for his colleague in
</p>
<p>the consulship Q. Caecilius Metellus, 1 11 B. C. He was totally defeated
</p>
<p>by the Cimbri in Gaul. (Liv. Epit. 65.) Eutropius says he defeated the
</p>
<p>Cimbri, but this is inaccurate.
</p>
<p>Sisenna, L. Cornelius. An historian of the Cornelian family, and
</p>
<p>descended from that Sisenna who was praetor A. U. C. 570. In his
</p>
<p>youth he practised as an orator, and is characterized by Cicero as a man
</p>
<p>of learning and wit, but of no great industry, or knowledge of business.
</p>
<p>In more advanced life he was praetor of Achaia, and a friend of Atticus.
</p>
<p>Vossius says his history commenced after the taking of Rome by the
</p>
<p>Gauls, and ended with the wars of Marius and Sylla. Now, it is pos-

</p>
<p>sible that he may have given some sketch of Roman affairs from the
</p>
<p>burning of the city by the Gauls, but it is evident he had touched
</p>
<p>slightly on these early portions of the history : for though his work con-
</p>
<p>sisted of twenty, or, according to others, of twenty-two books, it ap-
</p>
<p>pears from a fragment of the second, which is still preserved, that he
</p>
<p>nad there advanced in his narrative as far as the Social war, which broke
</p>
<p>out in the year 663. The greater part, therefore, was probably devoted
</p>
<p>to :he history of the civil wars of Marius : and indeed Velleius Pater-
</p>
<p>culus calls his work Opus Belli Civilis Sullani. The great defect of
</p>
<p>his history consisted, it is said, in its not being written with sufficient
</p>
<p>political freedom, at least concerning the character and conduct of Sylla,
</p>
<p>which is regretted by Sallust, in a passage bearing ample testimonv to
</p>
<p>the merits of Sisenna in other particulars. Cicero, while he admits his
</p>
<p>superiority over his predecessors, adds, that he was far from perfection,
</p>
<p>and complains that there was something puerile in his Annals, as if he
</p>
<p>had studied none of the Greek historians but Clitarchus. (Cic. de Leg.
</p>
<p>1, 2.) The fragments which remain of his history are more ryimerous
</p>
<p>than those of any old Latin annalist, being about 150 ; but thev are also

</p>
<p>Sittius Nucerinus, P. A Roman knight, born at Nuceria, whence
</p>
<p>his surname Nucerinus. Catiline, according to Sallust, reckoned hiift
</p>
<p>among his friends, and, according to the common account, he was net
</p>
<p>only connected with the conspiracy, but, having been summoned to stanC
</p>
<p>trial for some misdemeanor, before the discovery of the plot, he fled into
</p>
<p>Africa with a number of his associates and dependants, and assisted the
</p>
<p>king of Mauretania against the neighbouring princes. Cicero, however,
</p>
<p>in his oration for P. Cornelius Sylla, says, that he quitted the city in
</p>
<p>consequence of an agreement with the king of Mauretania ; that he had
</p>
<p>previously been there, and that the idea of his being in the conspiracy
</p>
<p>was absurd. The orator describes him as a respectable man, and calls
</p>
<p>him his old friend and acquaintance. Sittius, with his troops, afterwards
</p>
<p>ioined the standard of Julius Caesar in Africa, and rendered him im-
</p>
<p>portant service against the forces of Scipio and Juba. The conqueror
</p>
<p>bestowed upon him, as a recompense, the city and territory of Cirta.

</p>
<p>Spinther, or P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, held the office of curule
</p>
<p>aedile, B. C. 65, when Cicero and Antonius were consuls. His great
</p>
<p>wealth enabled him to display a magnificence in the celebration of the
</p>
<p>games, which surpassed what had ever before been seen at Rome. To
</p>
<p>his charge P. Lentulus Sura, who was then Praetor Urbanus, was con-
</p>
<p>fided, when the conspiracy of Catiline was detected in the capital. In the
</p>
<p>year 59 B. C. he was propraetor of Hispania Citerior. He was elected
</p>
<p>consul with Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos, and procured the recall of Ci-
</p>
<p>cero from banishment. In the civil war, he attached himself to the side
</p>
<p>of Pompey, and, having been taken prisoner, was brought before Caesar,
</p>
<p>at Corfinium, and set at liberty. He fought in the battle of Pharsalia,
</p>
<p>and fled to Rhodes, but the Rhodians refused him protection. Nothing
</p>
<p>farther is known of him. According to Valerius Maximus, he had the
</p>
<p>surname of Spinther, from his resemblance to a comedian of that name.
</p>
<p>Statilius, L. A Roman of equestrian rank, connected with the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy of Catiline, and strangled in prison.

<p>Sulla, L. Cornelius. A Roman of Patrician rank, who served at
</p>
<p>first under Marius. His activity and address contributed greatly to bring
</p>
<p>the Jugurthine war to a successful termination. Marius became, at last,
</p>
<p>jealous of Sylla's merit ; hence originated that quarrel between them,
</p>
<p>which was productive of the most enormous cruelties, and contributed
</p>
<p>to the final extinction of Roman liberty. Being sent to Asia to restrain
</p>
<p>the power of Mithridates, though under a different pretence, he proved
</p>
<p>himself both a brave soldier and an able general. On his return, he dis-
</p>
<p>played his military talerfts to great advantage in the Social war. So
</p>
<p>strongly were his soldiers attached to him, that when two tribunes were
</p>
<p>sent to take the command of his army, and give it to Marius, they stoned
</p>
<p>them to death. Marius, in revenge, put Sylla's friends in the city to the
</p>
<p>sword, upon which the latter marched to Rome, and compelled Marius
</p>
<p>to flee. The horrid proscription now began. A price was set on the
</p>
<p>head of Marius, but he effected his escape. Sylla then set out against
</p>
<p>Mithridates, defeated his armies under different generals, and concluded
</p>
<p>a peace with him on very advantageous terms. Marius and China having
</p>
<p>butchered many o Sylla's friends at Rome, he returned to Italy to avenge
</p>

</p>
<p>k heir deaths. On his arrival, his conduct was marked by clemency and
</p>
<p>moderation ; but no sooner were his enemies wholly within Ins power,
</p>
<p>than he committed the most enormous and barbarous acts of cruelty.
</p>
<p>To aggrandize himself, to exalt the patricians, and to glut his desire of
</p>
<p>revenge on his enemies, induced Sylla to assume the reins of absolute
</p>
<p>government. He corrected the abuses introduced by popular and un-
</p>
<p>principled demagogues, restored the ancient laws, and enacted many that
</p>
<p>were salutary and beneficial. Still, tyranny marked his whole conduct,
</p>
<p>md rendered his administration a scene of terror, by his personal enmi-
</p>
<p>ties and insufferable despotism. Desire of revenge was a stronger passion
</p>
<p>tti the mind of Sylla than love of power. After glutting his vengeance
</p>
<p>with the blood of thousands, and governing with despotic authority for
</p>
<p>.hree years, he resigned the reins of power, and lived undisturbed as a
</p>
<p>private citizen. He died in great torment of the morbus pedicularis, in
</p>
<p>the sixtieth year of his age, about 78 B. C. The perpetual intoxication
</p>
<p>-.0 which he had recourse to avoid the horrors of a guilty conscience,
</p>
<p>contributed to hasten his death.
</p>
<p>Syphax. A king of the Masaesyli, in Africa. At first he was hostile
</p>
<p>io the Carthaginians, and waged war against them ; but, on marrying
</p>
<p>Bophonisba, daughter of Hasdrubal, he formed an alliance with Carthage.
</p>
<p>He was defeated by Africanus in a night engagement, his tents being all
</p>
<p>destroyed by fire ; and was taken prisoner after a second battle, in which
</p>
<p>fie and Hasdrubal were overcome by Laelius and Masinissa. Scipio
</p>
<p>sent him to Rome, when the senate ordered him to be kept a prisoner at
</p>
<p>Alba, from which he was removed at a later period to Tibur.

<p>Tarquixius, L. A man who left Rome to join the army of Catiline,
</p>
<p>but who was apprehended and brought back. On his examination, he
</p>
<p>promised to make a full disclosure, if the public faith were pledged for
</p>
<p>his safety. On this being done, he implicated Crassus in the plot. This
</p>
<p>charge was deemed by the senate utterly false, and Tarquinius was
</p>
<p>ordered to be confined in prison, unless he gave up the person who had
</p>
<p>instigated him to the act.

<p>Vale-rius Flaccus, L. A Roman nobleman, distinguished for his
</p>
<p>military talents and general ability. He traced his descent from Va-
</p>
<p>lerius Poplicola. After holding the office of tribune of the soldiers in
</p>
<p>Cilicia, and being quaestor in Spain, he obtained the praetorship in the
</p>
<p>year in which Cicero was consul, and contributed by his activity to the
</p>
<p>crushing of Catiline's conspiracy. After the expiration of his praetor-
</p>
<p>ship, he succeeded to the government of Asia, and on his return was
</p>
<p>arraigned for extortion, but acquitted through the powerful eloquence of
</p>
<p>Cicero, who, together with Hortensius, pleaded his cause.

<p>Vargunteius, L. One of the accomplices of Catiline, who under-

<p>took, along with C. Cornelius, to murder Cicero in his own house. The

</p>
<p>were refused admittance. Cicero says they were both knights. Proba-

<p>of Catiline. He was intrusted by Lentulus with a letter for Catiline.
