<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>The relations between capital and labor, along the
</p>
<p>Burlington system in 1888, attracted the attention of
</p>
<p>employers and employes in all parts of the world.
</p>
<p>The causes which led to dissatisfaction on the part of
</p>
<p>the laborers, and their ineffectual efforts to remedy not-
</p>
<p>able evils, ought to be as widely known. The power
</p>
<p>which a great company has to coerce, or to punish,
</p>
<p>has hardly been known in this country until the great
</p>
<p>Burlington strike brought it out. The labor organiza-
</p>
<p>tions have a right to know what kind of a foe a rail-
</p>
<p>road company may become, what are its aggressions
</p>
<p>in time of peace, and what its tactics in time of strife.
</p>
<p>It is not likely that any of the parties who are con-
</p>
<p>spicuous in the contest had any thought that they
</p>
<p>were making history. None of the actors in the strug-
</p>
<p>gle between capital and labor had any thought that
</p>
<p>they were speaking into a phonograph, which some
</p>
<p>day would reproduce their words; or that a camera
</p>
<p>was beside them which would some day restore in un-
</p>
<p>erring light the relationships and attitudes of moments
</p>
<p>of blinding passion.
</p>
<p>Strangely enough, records were preserved, letters
</p>
<p>were copied, telegrams were stored away, and man}'
</p>
<p>persons have vivid recollections of the events just
</p>
<p>passed.
</p>
<p>The world has seen a new instance of the selfishness
</p>
<p>and relentlessness of capital; and legislators have come
</p>
<p>to the new tasks of regulating internal commerce, and

</p>
<p>protecting labor. Laboring men have come to see
</p>
<p>how varied and how vital are their relations to
</p>
<p>the prosperity of the country. They understand
</p>
<p>now better than ever before that the condition, re-
</p>
<p>sources, and aims of the laborer have more to do with
</p>
<p>the progress of any nation than the achievements of its
</p>
<p>arms, or the successes of its diplomacy.
</p>
<p>An increasing number of people desires that the
</p>
<p>history of the greatest labor contest of all time, should
</p>
<p>be put in permanent form, while the witnesses
</p>
<p>live. Accordingly, during the last few months, a few
</p>
<p>men located on the line of the Burlington system, have
</p>
<p>undertaken to print the record of the Burlington strike.
</p>
<p>This may guide other corporations into
</p>
<p>than that one madly chosen by the Burling'.
</p>
<p>may throw a light upon the relationships of
</p>
<p>er that will make him a wiser and more po. .tor

<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>On February 27th, 1888, at 4 o'clock A. M., the
</p>
<p>locomotive engine-men, on their own motion, terminated
</p>
<p>their connection with the Chicago, Burlington &
</p>
<p>Quincy Railroad Company. To prevent any needless
</p>
<p>damage to property, all the trains in transit at that
</p>
<p>hour went on to the nearest terminal station, but as
</p>
<p>nearly as possible to the stroke of the clock, the two
</p>
<p>thousand locomotive engineers and firemen quietly
</p>
<p>severed themselves from the Burlington system. It
</p>
<p>was not the work of a tumultuous assembly. The
</p>
<p>movement was well considered and cordially approved,
</p>
<p>and notice of intention was duly given to the company.
</p>
<p>As late as at 2 o'clock on the preceding day, a com-
</p>
<p>mittee had waited upon the authorities of the company
</p>
<p>to implore any concessions consistent with their obliga-
</p>
<p>tions to stockholders and duties to employes, that
</p>
<p>would avert the impending strike.
</p>
<p>The importance of the step which severed the
</p>
<p>engineers and firemen from the Burlington system
</p>
<p>can hardly be over-estimated. That great road ex-
</p>
<p>tends through the states of Illinois, Missouri, Iowa,
</p>
<p>Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Wisconsin and Minne-
</p>
<p>sota. It passes through more than fifteen hundred
</p>
<p>cities, towns and villages, all of which are more or less
</p>
<p>dependent upon its facilities for freight and travel. In

</p>
<p>some of these states competing and intersecting lines
</p>
<p>8 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>of road are numerous, so that the calamity of a block-
</p>
<p>ade would not be everywhere disastrous. In the
</p>
<p>various states traversed there are hundreds of small
</p>
<p>stations entirely dependent on the Burlington, and
</p>
<p>situated from fifteen to fifty miles from any other road.
</p>
<p>In case of a scarcity of coal among hundreds of prairie
</p>
<p>villages, the effect of a suspension of railroad traffic
</p>
<p>would be serious. To all the stations along a railroad
</p>
<p>track the company offers the convenience of trans-
</p>
<p>portation, and agrees to take in return the favor of
</p>
<p>patronage. The employes cannot be a party to this
</p>
<p>agreement, but the company is bound to the fairness
</p>
<p>and the foresight which will always prevent a suspen-
</p>
<p>sion of its work.
</p>
<p>The methods pursued by the engineers were peace-
</p>
<p>able. With a delicate sense of honor they regarded
</p>
<p>the right of property in the company with which they
</p>
<p>could no longer agree. The fifteen hundred engineers
</p>
<p>surrendered their engines with not a bolt, or screw,
</p>
<p>or valve out of order. The matters of complaint,
</p>
<p>with the unquestionable facts which underlay them,
</p>
<p>with dates and names, and records, were .laid before
</p>
<p>the chief officers of the company by calm, dispassionate
</p>
<p>men. Timely warning of the day and hour of the
</p>
<p>strike, with the causes compelling it, were fairly and
</p>
<p>fully given. The determination reached was not that
</p>
<p>of a tumultuous assembly, nor of an inflammable mob.
</p>
<p>The principles involved had been under public dis-
</p>
<p>cussion for years, and their correctness in the main had
</p>
<p>been conceded by various of the great Railroad Com-
</p>
<p>panies. It could be no trifling affair that thrilled with

<p>thousand miles of the Burlington lines. It is difficult
</p>
<p>for any one to estimate how much it meant when so
</p>
<p>many intelligent and practical men left their places,
</p>
<p>unfitted for any other skilled labor, and with the proba-
</p>
<p>bility that similar doors of employment would be closed
</p>
<p>to them upon other roads.
</p>
<p>Who is the Locomotive Engineer ?
</p>
<p>He is a man of bone and brawn, equal to the hard-
</p>
<p>est work. He inherits from a robust ancestry great
</p>
<p>bodilv vigor, as well as clearness and accuracy of eye
</p>
<p>and ear. He reaches a locomotive only after prepara-
</p>
<p>tory years of untiring study and toil. In his probation
</p>
<p>he acquires a quickness to detect danger and a prompt-
</p>
<p>ness to avert it. He cannot be an engineer unless he
</p>
<p>can command his tired nerves to work on in the face
</p>
<p>of rain and storm, or in defiance of sleet and cold.
</p>
<p>Higher than commanding the obedience of muscles
</p>
<p>and nerves, he must know the anatomy of his engine,
</p>
<p>and the remedy for all its maladies. On his soul is
</p>
<p>the responsibility for the safety of the precious freight
</p>
<p>of hundreds of passengers, and of hundreds of thou-
</p>
<p>sands of dollars. No other calling of civil life records
</p>
<p>such bravery in the face of peril, or such noble sacri-
</p>
<p>fice of self to save others. The locomotive engineer's
</p>
<p>craft is the drum over which every band of the coun-
</p>
<p>try's business gains its speed ; it is the master-wheel of
</p>
<p>the world's progress.
</p>
<p>We lie down in our sleeper and rest as we do at
</p>
<p>home. And yet we know that all through the night
</p>
<p>the train will dash on at the rate of forty miles an
</p>
<p>hour, past beacon-lights, switches, side-tracks and

<p>The curtain has been drawn for a moment to let the

<p>when Israel left Egypt, not a hoof was left behind.

<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>WHY DO LABORING MEN ORGANIZE ?
</p>
<p>If any one can tell when it was that man first dis-
</p>
<p>covered that in union there is power, it will fix the date
</p>
<p>when men first combined to secure to themselves
</p>
<p>prosperity and justice. Mechanical fraternities flour-
</p>
<p>ished among the Romans, in which affairs of com-
</p>
<p>mon interest were regulated by their own laws.
</p>
<p>In the eleventh century, in many cities of Italy, the
</p>
<p>people united against the rapacity of the lords, and ex-
</p>
<p>changed lordly rule for the right to labor and to trade
</p>
<p>as they deemed best. Merchants' combinations were
</p>
<p>common in all the flourishing cities of Europe in the
</p>
<p>twelfth century. In the same century the drapers of
</p>
<p>Hamburg, the shoemakers of Magdeburg, and various
</p>
<p>tradesmen of Milan formed unions, or brotherhoods,
</p>
<p>that have been closely imitated by various craftsmen
</p>
<p>in modern times. Guilds, as such organizations were
</p>
<p>called among the Saxons, were not necessarily trade
</p>
<p>associations, though they protected their members from
</p>
<p>injustice, secured their recognition and provided for
</p>
<p>their employment. In general they resisted arbitrary
</p>
<p>power as affecting the interests of their adherents.
</p>
<p>In England the guilds for centuries held their
</p>
<p>rights under royal charter, and in that century very
</p>
<p>many of the ordinary occupations were organized for
</p>
<p>mutual benefit. A great many of our associations of

</p>
<p>modern times can be traced to the Saxon tendency to
</p>
<p>12 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>organize bodies of men of similar pursuits. This is
</p>
<p>the origin of our corporations of every kind, as banks,
</p>
<p>insurance, and transportation companies. Our rail-
</p>
<p>road corporations, Boards of Trade, Associated Press,
</p>
<p>Knights of Labor, and many others, chartered and
</p>
<p>unchartered, all come from the same parent stock, and
</p>
<p>all bear the same family likeness, the main feature of
</p>
<p>which is combining for mutual protection and profit.
</p>
<p>Movements in connection with labor have assumed
</p>
<p>in recent times a new importance. Once they limited
</p>
<p>themselves simply to self-protection as to employment
</p>
<p>and wages. Now they study social relations and the
</p>
<p>reciprocal obligations of capital and labor. The lead-
</p>
<p>ing minds of the labor movement are by necessity
</p>
<p>students of political economy and of social science;
</p>
<p>and in their discussions and projects every calling ob-
</p>
<p>tains a hearing, and finds promotion. The equitable
</p>
<p>reward of honorable labor is the great social prol
</p>
<p>of our times. It is a reasonable prediction that from
</p>
<p>the ranks of organized labor shall come the strong
</p>
<p>writers, thinkers and statesmen of the future.
</p>
<p>But why do the employes of railroads organize ?
</p>
<p>Let us enumerate some of the reasons:
</p>
<p>i. It is the unquestioned usage of legislatures and
</p>
<p>of congress to grant to railroad corporations almost
</p>
<p>unlimited franchises, and in perpetuity, without any
</p>
<p>personal responsibility. On the other hand, no enact-
</p>
<p>ment of any importance is on any statute book to pro-
</p>
<p>tect railroad men, whose work upon trains imperils
</p>
<p>their lives with almost every dutv the}' perform. It
</p>
<p>is not unreasonable that trainmen should be disaffected

<p>wherever they are paid less than men are usually paid

</p>
<p>for similar work on other roads, and wherever they are
</p>
<p>held to a company by an arrangement that compels
</p>
<p>them to stay where they are, or else be prevented from
</p>
<p>railroad work anywhere else
</p>
<p>2. It is to be remembered also, that the life of a
</p>
<p>railroad is a perpetuity; that with time its expenses
</p>
<p>will lessen and its business will increase. In view of
</p>
<p>future incomes men will take present risks. Capital
</p>
<p>can always do this, but labor cannot. Labor repre-
</p>
<p>sents women and children; it implies food, clothing,
</p>
<p>shelter and education; the day's work if well done
</p>
<p>should meet these demands at par. The two millions,
</p>
<p>or more, now nearly three millions, of persons in
</p>
<p>the families of railway employes have the first lien on
</p>
<p>the products of their work. When, therefore, the
</p>
<p>railway laborer demands reasonable pay, he has be-
</p>
<p>hind him a regiment of arguments to enforce his right.
</p>
<p>The most of the work to be done is so difficult as to
</p>
<p>require experienced, or skilled labor; it is largely of a
</p>
<p>kind to impair health and to shorten life, and it ex-
</p>
<p>poses the laborer to great irregularities of work, and
</p>
<p>to a frightful percentage of fatal accidents. When
</p>
<p>losses occur to a company from mismanagement they
</p>
<p>should not be made up by abatement of the wages of
</p>
<p>laborers. If the business of a year proves dull, the
</p>
<p>stockholder's dividends should not be kept up by cut-
</p>
<p>ting down the wages of the men. One man alone
</p>
<p>counts nothing before a powerful company; one day's
</p>
<p>work bears a poor proportion to the thousands of mil-
</p>
<p>lions of capital invested in railroads. Unless labor
</p>
<p>combines it cannot be heard at all. It has no resort,

</p>
<p>relentless power of gold.
</p>
<p>3. The conditions of the trainman's life are hard.
</p>
<p>If he develops into a man of business, or if he becomes
</p>
<p>manager of great enterprises, it is in defiance of his
</p>
<p>surroundings. He usually enters in early life upon
</p>
<p>his occupation in which there is a premium on strength,
</p>
<p>alertness and endurance, and in which there is much
</p>
<p>of both physical weariness and mental dissipation. He
</p>
<p>is commonly exposed to allurements that tend down-
</p>
<p>wards. Along the line there are drinking places; if
</p>
<p>not in the station itself, then within a door or two. It
</p>
<p>is a rare thing that he finds a reading room for railway
</p>
<p>men, or a resting place away from tempting odors
</p>
<p>and sights and companions. It does not seem to be
</p>
<p>recognized at headquarters that what makes a better
</p>
<p>man makes a better workman. If there are anywhere
</p>
<p>in depots, reading rooms, and places of quiet rest for
</p>
<p>the much jolted men, it is very recent, and exceeding-
</p>
<p>ly rare, and even where there is considerable work of
</p>
<p>this kind it is rarely traceable to a railroad company.
</p>
<p>But almost all roads in this country have, in a verv
</p>
<p>effective way, testified to the capability and the charac-
</p>
<p>ter of the railroad employe. Almost everywhere
</p>
<p>men are filling the highest positions in railroad manage-
</p>
<p>ment who have come up from the lowest round. This
</p>
<p>: s very noticeable in the Pennsylvania system. Presi-
</p>
<p>- t Roberts, and A. J. Cassatt, formerly vice-presi-
</p>
<p>dent, began as rodmen in the engineers' corps. Sec-
</p>
<p>ond  vice-president Thompson was a machinist of
</p>
<p>Altoona; general manager Pugh began as a brake-

<p>WHY DO LAbuRING MEN ORGANIZE? 15
</p>
<p>McCrea, general manager west of Pittsburg, both
</p>
<p>began as messenger boys. A. M. Tucker, division
</p>
<p>superintendent on the Erie, was a track laborer. C.
</p>
<p>W. Bradley, general superintendent of the West Shore,
</p>
<p>was a brakeman, then conductor, on the same road.
</p>
<p>President Caldwell of the Nickel Plate was a clerk on
</p>
<p>the Pennsylvania. The engineers and firemen have
</p>
<p>been very prolific in this direction. One Division, No.
</p>
<p>34, of Columbus, Ohio, has on its roll of honor two
</p>
<p>railroad presidents, three master mechanics, and four
</p>
<p>roundhouse foremen. There can be no doubt that
</p>
<p>everywhere similar talent abounds among men in
</p>
<p>subordinate positions along all our great railway lines.
</p>
<p>That so many reach distinction in spite of great disad-
</p>
<p>vantage is an inspiring argument in favor of organization
</p>
<p>for mutual improvement and protection. It encourages
</p>
<p>honest emulation and true pride. Its result must be
</p>
<p>to make the men sober, industrious, frugal, faithful,
</p>
<p>and self-helpful.
</p>
<p>4. The capital invested in banks and that employed
</p>
<p>in insurance companies, though in large amounts, is
</p>
<p>vet comparatively harmless as regards labor.
</p>
<p>But when capital is pitted against labor; when the
</p>
<p>issue is Money vs. Men ; when the returns upon the
</p>
<p>invested capital are in proportion to the pressure upon
</p>
<p>the laborer, then as capital is heartless, the rights of
</p>
<p>the man must go under. The greatest danger is
</p>
<p>reached when capital succeeds in holding the laborer
</p>
<p>in one hand, and grasping legislation with the other.

<p>way companies in this country, will soon reach the

<p>1 6 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>enormous amount of ten thousand millions of dollars,
</p>
<p>($10,000,000,000.) A very small percentage on this
</p>
<p>sum will support a lobby, the third house, in every
</p>
<p>state capital, as well as at Washington. An assess-
</p>
<p>ment of one-fourth of one cent on each dollar of this
</p>
<p>vast sum would produce a revenue of twenty-five mil-
</p>
<p>lions. At present rates of increase we shall soon
</p>
<p>have in this country one million of railway laborers.
</p>
<p>A reduction of five cents per day upon that number of
</p>
<p>men would produce the sum of eighteen millions of
</p>
<p>dollars, ($18,250,000.) We do not say that anyone
</p>
<p>has proposed this, but we do say that similar things
</p>
<p>have been done. Wages have been cut down to re-
</p>
<p>plenish a foolishly exhausted treasury. How easy a
</p>
<p>thing it would be for capital to declare war on labor and
</p>
<p>then assess upon labor the expense of it. How easy
</p>
<p>to keep up dividends to stockholders by cutting down
</p>
<p>wages; or to cover the ruinous expense of an unwise
</p>
<p>policy in the management by issuing a lower rate of
</p>
<p>payments.
</p>
<p>Capital, controlling lobbies and newspapers, con-
</p>
<p>stitutes a trio for evil, before which, if it is left un-
</p>
<p>checked, the rights of the American laborer will be of
</p>
<p>as little value to him as to the toilers of Russia, or of
</p>
<p>Algiers. In Europe, when contests are on between
</p>
<p>money and labor, the appeal is to the bayonet; but in
</p>
<p>this country the appeal is to argument, to righteous-
</p>
<p>ness, and to the ballot. Our method of protection is
</p>
<p>not by violence, but by the peaceable combination of
</p>
<p>the endangered men, so as to make themselves felt by
</p>
<p>their moral force, their intelligence, and by their num-

<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS.
</p>
<p>We believe that there are certain great principles in
</p>
<p>equity in which both capital and labor ought heartily
</p>
<p>to agree, and beyond which the demands of either
</p>
<p>would be both unreasonable and unrighteous. There
</p>
<p>is really but one universal and unerring rule, viz : As
</p>
<p>ye would that men should do to you, do 3^ also to
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>Most men, given to one kind of work, become skilled
</p>
<p>in it, and unfit themselves for other employments, but at
</p>
<p>the same time increase the value of their labor to their
</p>
<p>employer. To be discharged implies the loss of the time
</p>
<p>used in acquiring the skiD, and also the waste of time
</p>
<p>and money in seeking a new place. It may require a
</p>
<p>removal of hundreds of miles at great expense. If
</p>
<p>permanent employment is uncertain, it will prevent the
</p>
<p>laborer from embellishing, or even from making a home,
</p>
<p>and it tends to make of him an improvident, hand-to-
</p>
<p>mouth hanger-on upon a temporary occupation, and
</p>
<p>the education of his children becomes a most unlikely
</p>
<p>thing. He cannot identify himself with permanent in-
</p>
<p>terests of the community, and he sinks into a character-
</p>
<p>less wage-earner. It would not be strange if some times
</p>
<p>the fear of removal would lead men to try to keep their
</p>
<p>places by unbecoming and wrongful methods, or they
</p>
<p>may do a poor service knowing they are liable to dis-

<p>wages, or compulsorily increase the hours of labor, or
</p>
<p>frequently require additional hours of work for the pay
</p>
<p>of ten, or compel the employe to assume the risk of
</p>
<p>damage to property, or say to the men unfairly
</p>
<p>burdened, ; ' If you do not like our administration, go
</p>
<p>elsewhere; you are at liberty." All these methods
</p>
<p>have, here or there, been resorted to. It is obvious
</p>
<p>that they deteriorate the character of the laborer, so
</p>
<p>as not only to lessen the value of the labor, but also
</p>
<p>to abate the worth of the man as a member of the com-
</p>
<p>munity. Certainly no corporation has a moral right to
</p>
<p>do this, for it unfits the employe for honorable and
</p>
<p>skilled work.
</p>
<p>Self-interest alone would require of a corporation
</p>
<p>the strictest integrity and fairness, and considerate pro-
</p>
<p>vision for the adequate support of every deserving
</p>
<p>laborer. Moral obligation would require that wages
</p>
<p>should be adequate for a little more than actual cur-
</p>
<p>rent support, for the rainy day should not be a desti-
</p>
<p>tute one, and comforts ought to increase in every vir-
</p>
<p>tuous family with advancing age. The pay for a day's
</p>
<p>work should be the unstinted remuneration for an
</p>
<p>average man, and less or greater work done than the
</p>
<p>average should have higher or lower rates. We can
</p>
<p>neither buy nor sell the moral sense that makes the
</p>
<p>workman industrious, and studious to do his work rap-
</p>
<p>idly and well, and to prevent loss of material ; but that
</p>
<p>moral sense has a real value nevertheless, and the man
</p>
<p>who has this quality really earns more money than the
</p>
<p>man of the same strength who has it not. It is not

<p>enough for the corporation to pay only the rate of wa-

</p>
<p>ges that it can afford with its present rate of dividends,
</p>
<p>for that would require labor to guarantee both the hon-
</p>
<p>esty and the intelligence of capital. If wisdom and hon-
</p>
<p>esty are in the foundation of an enterprise, its dividends
</p>
<p>may be delayed for years, and then make ample com-
</p>
<p>pensation; but food and clothing, and comforts, cannot
</p>
<p>wait. The conclusion is inevitable that every corpora-
</p>
<p>tion employing labor is bound by the highest law
</p>
<p>known to man, to make contented and comfortable,
</p>
<p>every worthy employe it has, and to do this before it
</p>
<p>retires to count its profits.
</p>
<p>One fact is better than many theories. The Chi-
</p>
<p>cago Inter-Ocean of June 20, 1889, says:
</p>
<p>" One thing has been demonstrated by General Mc-
</p>
<p>Nulty, while receiver of the Wabash, that the best
</p>
<p>managers are not always trained railroad men. Gen-
</p>
<p>eral McNulty dropped his law practice to accept the
</p>
<p>appointment of receiver of a small railroad in southern
</p>
<p>Illinois, which was bankrupt. He built this road up,
</p>
<p>and turned it back to the stock holders as a paying-
</p>
<p>piece of property. When Judge Gresham appointed
</p>
<p>General McNulty receiver of the Wabash road, the
</p>
<p>property w r as in a deplorable condition, and he has
</p>
<p>succeeded in placing it in a better condition than ever
</p>
<p>before, and he has himself come to be acknowledged
</p>
<p>as one of the best railroad managers of the country, so
</p>
<p>that he has received nattering offers from roads that
</p>
<p>are anxious to secure his services."
</p>
<p>The pay of the labor of this road, while this able
</p>
<p>financier was building it up, was among the best that
</p>
<p>was paid in the United States. General McNulty

</p>
<p>THE DAWNING OF TROUBLE.
</p>
<p>In 1862 the engineers running between Aurora,
</p>
<p>thirty-seven miles west of Chicago, and Galesburg,
</p>
<p>one hundred and twenty-five miles farther west, were
</p>
<p>paid less than other engineers were paid for the same
</p>
<p>service on other parts of the C, B. & Q. road. They
</p>
<p>believed that the injustice was directly chargeable to the
</p>
<p>division superintendent, Mr. Hammond, and accord-
</p>
<p>ingly they demanded of him its correction. They ap-
</p>
<p>pointed a committee to wait upon Mr. Hammond, to
</p>
<p>ask an advance of fifty cents per day or trip, and pay
</p>
<p>for extra time. Mr. Hammond would not grant it, and
</p>
<p>the committee returned and so reported. They then
</p>
<p>agreed to insist on their demand and to give the super-
</p>
<p>intendent ten days' notice, at the end of which time they
</p>
<p>would stop work if the matter was not adjusted.
</p>
<p>This notice was given. On the day when the time
</p>
<p>would expire, a despatch came from Mr. Hammond
</p>
<p>asking the men to keep at work and he would see
</p>
<p>that they were satisfied. The men were not disposed
</p>
<p>to make a contract in so loose a way as that and de-
</p>
<p>clined. When this news reached Mr. Hammond by
</p>
<p>telegram, he called up a special train to take himself
</p>
<p>and party to Aurora, the seat of the difficulty, and on
</p>
<p>his arrival it was found that he had with him eighteen
</p>
<p>engineers to take the places of these men. But it was

</p>
<p>or could not take the engines, and superintendent
</p>
<p>Hammond acceded to the demand. Work was sus-
</p>
<p>pended only one hour.
</p>
<p>It is fair to the Company to state that when a sup-
</p>
<p>erintendent, or other high administrative officer, cor-
</p>
<p>rects an abuse in the administration without consulting
</p>
<p>his superiors, it is evident that he is the originator of
</p>
<p>the annoying order himself. ^The unanimity of the en-
</p>
<p>gineers in this matter, and the prompt adjustment of it

<p>by the superintendent, indicate the justness of the

<p>CHAPTER V.
</p>
<p>BROTHERHOOD OF LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS.
</p>
<p>On the 17th of April, 1863, at Marshall, Michigan,
</p>
<p>Messrs. E. Nichols, F. Avery, D. Wheeler, John Ken-
</p>
<p>ned}-, F. Wartsmouth, H. Higgins, B. Northrup, Geo.
</p>
<p>Q. Adams, and W. D. Robinson, believing that
</p>
<p>many evils might be remedied, and much good accom-
</p>
<p>plished, by an organization of practical locomotive en-
</p>
<p>gineers, met and instituted a society named the Broth-
</p>
<p>erhood of the Foot Board. The 17th and the 18th of
</p>
<p>the following August was agreed upon by them as the
</p>
<p>time for holding the first annual convention at Detroit,
</p>
<p>Michigan, at which convention W. D. Robinson, of De-
</p>
<p>troit, was duly elected to fill, for the first time in its ex-
</p>
<p>istence, the very important office of Grand Chief Engi-
</p>
<p>neer, and O. T. Johnson, of LaFayette, Indiana, was
</p>
<p>chosen first Grand Assistant Engineer. By a provis-
</p>
<p>ion of the original constitution, locomotive firemen and
</p>
<p>machinists were admitted to equal membership. A
</p>
<p>short deliberation, and experience, convinced the in-
</p>
<p>corporators that engineers should act separately in the
</p>
<p>matter of self protection. Hence it became necessary
</p>
<p>to call a special session of the convention, which as-
</p>
<p>sembled on the 22nd of February, 1864, at Detroit, at

<p>which time and place this objectionable clause was
</p>
<p>24 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>changed and the locomotive engineers were possessed
</p>
<p>of an organization exclusively their own.
</p>
<p>At the second annual convention, which was held at
</p>
<p>Indianapolis, Indiana, on August 17th, 1864, Charles
</p>
<p>Wilson, of Rochester, New York, and Robert Laugh--
</p>
<p>lin, of Hornellsville, New York, were chosen to fill the
</p>
<p>two highest offices of the organization, and the title
</p>
<p>originally chosen was substituted by the title which is
</p>
<p>still borne by the order, viz : The Brotherhood of
</p>
<p>Locomotive Engineers.
</p>
<p>That a good thing was done in the organization of
</p>
<p>the order is evident from its rapid growth. This con-
</p>
<p>vention at Indianapolis was held at the end of its first
</p>
<p>vear, when sixty-seven of its subordinate divisions had
</p>
<p>been established, with a membership of over sixteen
</p>
<p>hundred. To-day the order extends through every
</p>
<p>part of the United states, and has a footing also in
</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico. The number of divisions
</p>
<p>has reached four hundred and twenty, and the member-
</p>
<p>ship exceeds twenty-five thousand.
</p>
<p>There is a Mutual Insurance Association connected
</p>
<p>with the Order and an outgrowth of it, originating
</p>
<p>1867. The business and the reports cover now a period
</p>
<p>of twenty-one years of the work of insurance with
</p>
<p>the most satisfactory results. There were paid out,
</p>
<p>during the year previous to November, 1888, one hun-
</p>
<p>dred claims of three thousand dollars each, making a
</p>
<p>total of three hundred and twenty-seven thousand
</p>
<p>dollars, ( $327,000. ) The entire amount paid to wid-
</p>
<p>ows, orphans and to disabled members, since 1867. is
</p>
<p>$2,572,169.61.

<p>During the vear ending with November, 18S8, the
</p>
<p>BROTHERHOOD OF LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS. 25
</p>
<p>Chief Engineer was called to interpose and to adjust be-
</p>
<p>tween men and officers on twelve different roads, and
</p>
<p>in each instance he effected an honorable and amicable
</p>
<p>adjustment. The contest between the men and the
</p>
<p>officers of the Burlington System was the only one
</p>
<p>that has occurred in eleven years that has not yielded
</p>
<p>to satisfactory adjustment by friendly interposition.
</p>
<p>The history of the Order is made up of happy results
</p>
<p>upon individual character, inspiring men with emula-
</p>
<p>tion, and virtuous pride in their calling. By its refin-
</p>
<p>ing and elevating influence upon the character of its
</p>
<p>members it adds to the efficiency and to the actual
</p>
<p>wealth of every company whose engines are run by
</p>
<p>members of the Brotherhood.
</p>
<p>In the constitution of subordinate lodges of this
</p>
<p>Brotherhood, in article V, section II, we have these
</p>
<p>words :
</p>
<p>" Should it come to the knowledge of any member

<p>* * * that a brother * * * is guilty of drunkenness,
</p>
<p>or keeping a saloon where intoxicating liquors are

<p>sold, or being engaged in the traffic of intoxicating
</p>
<p>liquors * * it shall be his duty to bring the matter
</p>
<p>before the Chief Engineer of his division, in writing at
</p>
<p>once, who shall immediately appoint a committee of
</p>
<p>three to investigate the charges."
</p>
<p>Section IV. (After the testimony is all offered.) "The
</p>
<p>Chief Engineer shall order the ballot passed, and it shall
</p>
<p>require a majority vote of all of the members present
</p>
<p>to expel him, excepting those convicted of keeping a
</p>
<p>saloon where intoxicating liquors are sold; in which
</p>
<p>case it shall be the duty of the Chief to declare the
</p>
<p>offending brother duly expelled without a ballot."

<p>CHAPTER VI.
</p>
<p>BROTHERHOOD OF LOCOMOTIVE FIREMEN.
</p>
<p>The locomotive firemen effected an organization, a
</p>
<p>Brotherhood, for mutual benefit, on December i,
</p>
<p>1873, at Port Jervis, New York. Eleven men met to
</p>
<p>devise means of mutual helpfulness, social, moral and
</p>
<p>intellectual, to protect the interests of firemen and to
</p>
<p>promote their general welfare. It has, in these six-
</p>
<p>teen years, permeated every part of the United States,
</p>
<p>extending also into Mexico and Canada. The Order
</p>
<p>receives reports from three hundred and ninety lodges,
</p>
<p>aggregating over nineteen thousand members. Its
</p>
<p>object at first was not beyond the mutual advantages
</p>
<p>that come from close affiliation of men of similar pur-
</p>
<p>suits; but in 1885 the Order extended its purposes and
</p>
<p>became distinctly a labor organization without losing
</p>
<p>its benevolent characteristics. The method of adjust-
</p>
<p>ing differences between the Order and the authorities
</p>
<p>of a road, is to appeal directly to the highest authority
</p>
<p>of the company complained of, and if that is not suc-
</p>
<p>cessful, then to insist upon arbitration. The organiza-
</p>
<p>tion tends to good order, to mutual beneficial influ-
</p>
<p>ences, and it is a concentration of power which may,
</p>
<p>at almost any time, be called upon for mutual pro-
</p>
<p>tection, or in some way in the defense of the interests
</p>
<p>of labor. There is no antagonism between the fire-
</p>
<p>men and any other society of railway laborers; on the

</p>
<p>contrary, the Order works for the advantage of the
</p>
<p>28 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>laborer in the interests of fair work for fair pay.
</p>
<p>In the constitution of the Firemen's Brotherhood
</p>
<p>for subordinate lodges, there are some provisions of
</p>
<p>general interest:
</p>
<p>Section 188. " Any member dealing in intoxicating
</p>
<p>liquors shall be expelled."
</p>
<p>Section 190. "Any member who shall use intoxi-
</p>
<p>cating liquors to excess, or shall be found guilty of
</p>
<p>drunkenness, or other immoral practice, or conduct un-
</p>
<p>becoming a member, shall be suspended for the first
</p>
<p>offense, if of a light character; but if of a serious na-
</p>
<p>ture, or for a second offense, the offender shall be ex-

</p>
<p>switchmen's mutual aid association.
</p>
<p>The switchmen at Chicago organized a Union, for
</p>
<p>mutual aid, intended for only local purposes, on Au-
</p>
<p>gust 1 8, 1877. The society had but little progress
</p>
<p>until 1884, wnen it took in new blood, and various cit-
</p>
<p>ies began to organize similar societies. A meeting of
</p>
<p>delegates, for the object of forming a national organi-
</p>
<p>zation, was held at Chicago, February 22, 1886. The
</p>
<p>convention deliberated eight days over a constitution,
</p>
<p>which was adopted at last with enthusiastic unanimity.
</p>
<p>The object of the Mutual Aid Society, as declared in
</p>
<p>the preamble to the Constitution, is as follows :
</p>
<p>1st. To unite and promote the general welfare, and
</p>
<p>advance the interests  social, moral, and intellectual 
</p>
<p>of its members.
</p>
<p>2nd. To endeavor to establish mutual confidence,
</p>
<p>and create and maintain harmonious relations between
</p>
<p>employer and employe.
</p>
<p>The forms of benevolence undertaken were, " to re-
</p>
<p>lieve the distress of disabled brothers, to care for
</p>
<p>their widows and orphans, and to see to the decent
</p>
<p>burial of deceased members."
</p>
<p>The first annual meeting was held in Kansas Citv,
</p>
<p>Monday, September 20, 1886, having delegates from
</p>
<p>tw r enty-five lodges.
</p>
<p>The first Grand Master was James L. Monaghan,

</p>
<p>to the outdoor work of the switchman. He became
</p>
<p>a member of the Illinois legislature in 1888. From
</p>
<p>that time on, the Society has been fortunate in having
</p>
<p>for officers, good and efficient men. In 1888, Mr.
</p>
<p>George S. Bailey was made Grand Organizer and In-
</p>
<p>structor, who also left the law for outdoor railroading
</p>
<p>work. In 1886 he became a member of the lower
</p>
<p>house of the Illinois legislature, and carried through
</p>
<p>a bill for a State Board of Arbitration, but not in
</p>
<p>time to have the action of the Senate. The Order is
</p>
<p>a vigorous one, watching carefully the interests of

</p>
<p>BROTHERHOOD OF RAILROAD BRAKEMEN.
</p>
<p>The epidemic of organization struck the railroad
</p>
<p>brakemen in the spring of 1883. A few railroad men
</p>
<p>of all occupations, chiefly brakemen and switchmen,
</p>
<p>formed, at Albany, N. Y., a society called the Capitol
</p>
<p>City Aid Association. The object was protection by mu-
</p>
<p>tual benevolence. In June following, eight brakemen
</p>
<p>met in a caboose at Oneonta, N. Y., and organized the
</p>
<p>first auxiliary branch, called No. 2. This enterprising
</p>
<p>offspring withdrew from Capitol City and set itself up
</p>
<p>as Oneonta Lodge of the Brotherhood of Railroad
</p>
<p>Brakemen. This occurred in July, 1883. Its mem-
</p>
<p>bers were all brakemen. The Order was greatly in-
</p>
<p>debted to Eugene V. Debs, a good man, who was emi-
</p>
<p>nent among the Brotherhood of Firemen. The Capi-
</p>
<p>tol City Aid Association, rinding itself no longer fol-
</p>
<p>lowed, turned about and followed the new head and
</p>
<p>became Capitol City Lodge, No. 3.
</p>
<p>The organization by the adoption of a constitution,
</p>
<p>bears date, Oneonta, N. Y., Sept. 12, 1883. The Or-
</p>
<p>der spread along the lines of iron net work with great
</p>
<p>rapidity, and it numbers now over ten thousand mem-
</p>
<p>bers. It rilled a well defined want among trainmen.
</p>
<p>Their position is not too well paid, and it is full of
</p>
<p>hardship, privation and peril. The calling is so full of
</p>
<p>danger that insurance men exclude brakemen from

<p>CHAPTER IX.
</p>
<p>REDUCED WAGES AND CLASSIFICATION.
</p>
<p>In 1873, the C, B. & Q. road used only a single
</p>
<p>track in doing the company's business between Chica-
</p>
<p>go and Galesburg. The volume of business was so
</p>
<p>great that trains met with many delays, often waiting
</p>
<p>for hours upon the side track, waiting for Chicago
</p>
<p>bound trains having the right of way. Trains bound
</p>
<p>west would often be many hours more than time al-
</p>
<p>lotted on the time-card in making the trip, and no al-
</p>
<p>lowance was ever made for such service. It also had
</p>
<p>been the practice to allow the men to go into the re-
</p>
<p>pair shops with their engines when they needed re-
</p>
<p>pairing, and work on them. This usage had been
</p>
<p>discontinued and the men would sometimes have to
</p>
<p>wait in idleness for months, while the engine was un-
</p>
<p>der repairs. Being left without work, reduction of
</p>
<p>pay and other conditions equally unsatisfactory, induced
</p>
<p>the engineers to appoint a committee, which con-
</p>
<p>sisted of L. E. Johnson, who is at this writing super-
</p>
<p>intendent at Aurora, William Wilson, and J. C. Por-
</p>
<p>ter, who were instructed to draw up a paper to be
</p>
<p>submitted to the various divisions for approval, or cor-
</p>
<p>rection, and, if approved, to be presented to the gen-
</p>
<p>eral manager, Mr Harris, with the request that the
</p>
<p>matters complained of should be investigated and
</p>
<p>remedied. The committee chosen to present this

</p>

</p>
<p>following letter to the General Manager:
</p>
<p>Galesburg, 111., Sept. 23, 1873.
</p>
<p>Robert Harris, Esq.,
</p>
<p>General Supt, C, B. & Q. R R.
</p>
<p>Dear Sir
</p>
<p>The engineers of the C, B. & Q. R. R.,
</p>
<p>and leased lines east of the Mississippi River,
</p>
<p>feeling that they are not receiving sufficient pay for
</p>
<p>the labor performed, have requested the undersigned
</p>
<p>engineers to wait upon the general officers of the road,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of requesting them to increase our
</p>
<p>pay to the standard of $4 per day, on all divisions of
</p>
<p>the road as they now are, also that the nine-tenths of full
</p>
<p>time be allowed them when not made, the same to be
</p>
<p>paid monthly, allowing all extra time made over and
</p>
<p>above. The reasons for the above are as follows:
</p>
<p>1. The increase of responsibility placed upon them.
</p>
<p>2. The increase of the number of hours on the road.
</p>
<p>3. The increased amount of work performed while
</p>
<p>on duty.
</p>
<p>4. That a transfer of engines and men from Aurora
</p>
<p>to Galesburg has largely increased their expenses, al-
</p>
<p>so keeping them from their homes much more than
</p>
<p>previous to the change.
</p>
<p>5. That engines running from Aurora to Chicago
</p>
<p>on freight, are in many instances compelled to run
</p>
<p>to the stock yards and then to the Chicago yards, re-
</p>
<p>quiring from ten to sixteen hours for one day's work.

</p>
<p>REDUCED WAGES AND CLASSIFICATION. 35
</p>
<p>readiness for duty at all times, both night and day,
</p>
<p>frequently being called upon for certain hours, and
</p>
<p>after remaining in yards waiting for trains from two to
</p>
<p>six hours, on their engines, then being obliged to
</p>
<p>make their trip for the same amount of pay.
</p>
<p>We would also be pleased to have our firemen paid
</p>
<p>in the same proportion.
</p>
<p>The above we most respectfully lay before you for
</p>
<p>your consideration and favor.

<p>To Robert Harris, Esq., Chicago, 111.,
</p>
<p>To this there came a reply as follows:
</p>
<p>Chicago, 111., Oct. 27, 1873.
</p>
<p>Messrs. B. Wagner, I. Alexander andL. E.Johnson,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Committee:
</p>
<p>"It was "understood at the time you
</p>
<p>presented the communication about pay, September
</p>
<p>23, that I would look into the matter and see if.
</p>
<p>there appeared proper grounds for increasing it.
</p>
<p>This has been done, and the conclusion is not to in-
</p>
<p>crease the standard of compensation. I think it will
</p>
<p>appear, all things considered, that the engineers and
</p>
<p>firemen on this road are compensated as highly as else-
</p>
<p>where.
</p>
<p>Mr. Chalender is authorized to make a proper al-
</p>
<p>lowance, over and above the existing standard on the

</p>
<p>to the stock yards and thence to the freight station.
</p>
<p>The division master mechanic will see that the diffi-
</p>
<p>culty of being called unnecessarily early before start-
</p>
<p>ing is remedied, if engineers will call his attention to
</p>
<p>it whenever it occurs.
</p>
<p>Yours Truly,
</p>
<p>(Signed) Robert Harris.
</p>
<p>The delays, of which the committee complained,
</p>
<p>were liable to occur every day, and cost the engineers
</p>
<p>an average of three hours each trip, making an aver-
</p>
<p>age of three hours of unpaid labor. ' The remark of
</p>
<p>Mr. Harris that the engineers were paid as well as
</p>
<p>elsewhere is true, if we consider the pav for the trip
</p>
<p>under favorable circumstances. The company has
</p>
<p>usuallv paid extreme prices on what is called the
</p>
<p>main line, and so they prevented the possibility of a
</p>
<p>united effort to correct unfavorable rates on the other
</p>
<p>parts of the system. This will be more clearly pre-
</p>
<p>sented in the work of the committee of 1886.
</p>
<p>The effort to set right a grievous wrong in 1873,
</p>
<p>had little effect, except to intensify a sense of injus-
</p>
<p>tice in the minds of the men, and also to confirm the
</p>
<p>officers of the road in their purpose to tighten their
</p>
<p>grip on their employes. Up to this time there was au
</p>
<p>apprenticeship of one year for engineers, paying $3 per
</p>
<p>day. and after one year, full pay, viz: $3.87 y 2 . But an
</p>
<p>order was issued October 1, 1876, which had some-,
</p>
<p>thing of the suddenness and the effect of a bombshell:
</p>
<p>Chicago, 111., Oct. 1, 1876.
</p>

<p>This was a cut of ten per cent on former wages,
</p>
<p>and it included all train men. A meeting of train men
</p>
<p>was called at Galesburg in which all grades of work
</p>
<p>were well represented, and a petition was signed by
</p>
<p>one hundred arid thirty employes, asking that wages
</p>
<p>be put back to the rates prior to December, 1873.

<p>The officers of the road insisted upon the necessity

<p>and the fairness of the reduction of wages, and so it

<p>remained.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER X.
</p>
<p>BURLINGTON POLICY DEFINED.
</p>
<p>We now propose to ask what the necessity was
</p>
<p>which took, with one flourish of the pen, ten cents of
</p>
<p>every dollar of income from every train man on the C,
</p>
<p>B. & Q. system. Then bear in mind -that a small as-
</p>
<p>sessment on a very large number will produce an
</p>
<p>enormous sum. For example: the Union Pacific
</p>
<p>Road, according to its president's report in 1888, em-
</p>
<p>ploys 14,000 men. Their pay ranges from $1 to $4
</p>
<p>per day. Let the average be, say, $2 per day,
</p>
<p>and ten per cent on all salaries would yield an income
</p>
<p>of $2,800 per day, or in a year of 315 days, $882,000.
</p>
<p>These figures show that railway managers can play a
</p>
<p>great game with small factors. Employes will not
</p>
<p>leave for trifling reasons. To take the risk of finding-
</p>
<p>other work, with probable loss of time and expense of
</p>
<p>moving, and perhaps leaving a little property, is a se-
</p>
<p>rious matter, and the laborer will submit to extortion till
</p>
<p>endurance is no longer possible. Then the corporation
</p>
<p>defines the required labor and its conditions, and fixes
</p>
<p>the wages, and so settles at once both the buying and
</p>
<p>selling price of labor. The laborer, therefore, in be-
</p>
<p>ginning work for a railway of close calculations, as-
</p>
<p>sumes the risks of the company without being a sharer
</p>
<p>in its profits. Now the railway laborer may have to
</p>
<p>suffer a reduction of wages for either of two reasons:

<p>One way in which he may lose, is when he is com-

</p>
<p>pelled to build up the position and the fortune of the
</p>
<p>chief officers of the road, personally. A few years
</p>
<p>ago, the mayor and aldermen of Toronto were inves-
</p>
<p>tigating the affairs of the Grand Trunk of Canada.
</p>
<p>In the examination, alderman Tinning asked a wit-
</p>
<p>ness: "Mr. Duffin, will you explain about the thirty-
</p>
<p>five per cent ?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Duffin : " It means that by whatever means the
</p>
<p>chief officers of the road reduce the working expenses
</p>
<p>of the road, they have a guarantee from the board of
</p>
<p>directors in the old country of thirty-five per cent on
</p>
<p>that account."
</p>
<p>Alderman Bronsted : "But who gets that ?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Duffin : " The heads of departments, Messrs.
</p>
<p>Hickson, Wallace, Blackwell, Spicer, and Roberts.
</p>
<p>Probably, when they see this report, they may try to
</p>
<p>deny it, but I am prepared to prove it. Roberts de-
</p>
<p>nied, but Blackwell said it was true, and that he had
</p>
<p>$130 over his last quarter's salary, from savings he had
</p>
<p>effected in his department. I told Mr. Hickson and
</p>
<p>Mr. Wallis that that was a grievance last year, and that
</p>
<p>men could not see how the officers could demean them-
</p>
<p>selves to try to reduce our wages in order to put
</p>
<p>thirtv-five per cent in their pockets."
</p>
<p>After all, the affairs of the Grand Trunk prove
</p>
<p>nothing concerning other trunks, but one thing is cer-
</p>
<p>tain, if a high officer anywhere, has the faculty to an-
</p>
<p>nually increase the gross product of his department,
</p>
<p>and as regularly reduce its working expenses, the com-
</p>
<p>pany would grapple him with hooks of silver, and he
</p>
<p>would be too valuable to lose. Before such a man,

<p>higher positions and finer salaries would open, and
</p>
<p>40 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>tempting offers from other roads would descend upon
</p>
<p>him like gentle rain on the tender grass.
</p>
<p>Another way in which a railway laborer may be a
</p>
<p>loser, is when his wages must be cut down to make up
</p>
<p>for losses by mismanagement at headquarters. Ev-
</p>
<p>ery reader of these facts will remember the cut of rates
</p>
<p>in 1876, in which there was a powerful combination
</p>
<p>against New York City. It was a universal, magnifi-
</p>
<p>cent strike. It was official striking official, road strik-
</p>
<p>ing road. Freight was carried for less than it cost.
</p>
<p>Passengers were almost hired to ride in the sleeping
</p>
<p>cars. The old rate of fifteen dollars a ton from New
</p>
<p>York to Chicago went down to four. So wild did the
</p>
<p>rivalry of rates run, that the stockholders of the Mich-
</p>
<p>igan Central Railway Company, four hundred and
</p>
<p>fiftv-four of them, employed the best legal talent in
</p>
<p>the land, Henry S. Bennett, 14 Wall street, New
</p>
<p>York, and served a notice on Hon. Samuel Sloan,
</p>
<p>president of that company, insisting upon it that the
</p>
<p>ruinous, suicidal policy of cutting rates must be at
</p>
<p>once abandoned. The shareholders directed their
</p>
<p>attorneys to say to President Sloan, " We ask you to
</p>
<p>restore and maintain the former rates for travel and
</p>
<p>freight, and to withdraw from any combination which
</p>
<p>has for its object any undue reduction, with a view to
</p>
<p>compete with other roads. If you refuse, or fail to
</p>
<p>comply therewith, I, and my associates, are directed
</p>
<p>by them, to employ such remedies as the courts will
</p>
<p>afford to enforce their rights, and to protect the prop-
</p>
<p>erty and interests of the company." The mismanage-

<p>BURLINGTON POLICY DEFINED. 41
</p>
<p>The inevitable result was the exhaustion of great
</p>
<p>surpluses, and the depletion of treasuries. There
</p>
<p>was One untried source of income,  the management
</p>
<p>could cut down the wages of laborers on the roads.
</p>
<p>What did they do ?
</p>
<p>The New Jersey Central ordered a cut of ten per-
</p>
<p>cent to take effect August i, 1876. At a stockhold
</p>
<p>ers' meeting on February 7, Mr. Knight, president-
</p>
<p>of the company said : " The Central R. R., of New
</p>
<p>Jersey, had declared since 1866, dividends aggregat-
</p>
<p>ing $14,400,000. That had these been aver-
</p>
<p>aged at eight per cent, there would have been left in
</p>
<p>the treasury $3,413,666.13." This meeting was called
</p>
<p>to borrow, or assess the stockholders $3,000,000, the
</p>
<p>result of an effort to ruin other roads through a war
</p>
<p>of rates. This was made to appear at a meeting held
</p>
<p>at St. James Hotel, in New York City, on December
</p>
<p>16, 1876, which was attended by the presidents of the
</p>
<p>Erie, New York Central, Pennsylvania Central, Bal-
</p>
<p>timore and Ohio, and others, when an agreement was
</p>
<p>entered into to restore the rates, and terminate the
</p>
<p>discrimination against New York, as an export city.
</p>
<p>This was an acknowledgment of the cause of the
</p>
<p>financial depression of the railroad companies, whose
</p>
<p>unwise policy had caused the loss. The method of
</p>
<p>replenishing was not to assess the loss on capital, but
</p>
<p>on labor, and by their great power to compel the la-
</p>
<p>borer to make their losses good, or at least to assist
</p>
<p>in doing so.
</p>
<p>In accordance with this policy the rate of wages was
</p>
<p>reduced, not by common consent, nor by any pretense
</p>
<p>that a general financial change in the country would

</p>
<p>enable the laborer to endure it, but by a sovereign or-
</p>
<p>der that on such a day, "your pay will be reduced ten
</p>
<p>per cent." These orders flashed across the country
</p>
<p>in alarming rapidity. The New Jersey Central cut
</p>
<p>wages on August i, 1876; the Chicago, Burlington &
</p>
<p>Quincv on October 10; the Cairo & St. Louis on
</p>
<p>November 1 ; the Grand Trunk, of Canada, on Dec-
</p>
<p>ember 7. Many other roads fell in line with the
</p>
<p>same policy. The third cut on the Pennsylvania Cen-
</p>
<p>tral was made on May 27, 1877, reducing engineers
</p>
<p>to $2.70 per day, and firemen to $1.25.
</p>
<p>Some railroad companies, whatever they had done
</p>
<p>in the war of rates, had not the excuse of poverty for
</p>
<p>cutting down salaries. For example: " The net
</p>
<p>earnings from lines operated by the Pennsylvania R.
</p>
<p>R., company during the year 1876 amounted to $12,-
</p>
<p>834,385.78, and yet retrenchment is the cry. 1 " From
</p>
<p>this statement it is evident that this road survived the
</p>
<p>war in good shape, as it shows an increase of over a
</p>
<p>million dollars over the year 1875. But it was a good
</p>
<p>time to join in effectively tying up railway labor, by
</p>
<p>the exercise of a right that comes not from justice, but
</p>
<p>from the merciless power of capital.
</p>
<p>We have already alluded to the fact that a petition of
</p>
<p>one hundred and thirty engineers was presented to
</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchcock without result. The engineers sent
</p>
<p>their committee to Galesburg, where they met on
</p>

<p>ender, master mechanic, and Mr. Strong, division
</p>
<p>superintendent, and represented:
</p>
<p>That the pay of engineers had been reduced.
</p>
<p>That the plan of apprenticing engineers for six to
</p>
<p>ten years before getting full pay was oppression.
</p>
<p>That the Burlington stock yards run was reduced
</p>
<p>fifty cents per day and the hours were increased.
</p>
<p>That at Mt. Pleasant and at Chicago, switching was
</p>
<p>required for from two to eight hours without pay being
</p>
<p>allowed for it; that with overloaded trains they
</p>
<p>must double the hills, losing one to five hours; also that
</p>
<p>they shall have respectful treatment from division
</p>
<p>master mechanics.
</p>
<p>Some of the minor complaints were adjusted, and
</p>
<p>others were referred to the general superintendent,
</p>
<p>Mr. Robert Harris. That gentleman was away from
</p>
<p>the city, and to their telegram he replied that he could
</p>
<p>not return until the midlde of the next week. The
</p>
<p>committee then reported to their respective divisions,
</p>
<p>and they voted to refer the subject to the convention
</p>
<p>to be held in October.
</p>
<p>On December 8, 1876, the committee went again
</p>
<p>to Chicago, in company with Grand Chief Engineer,
</p>
<p>P. M. Arthur. Thev went to the office of the gener-
</p>
<p>al superintendent, Mr. Robert Harris, and found him
</p>
<p>in an excited state of mind, pacing the floor, stroking
</p>
<p>his hair with one hand, and so absorbed as to forget to
</p>
<p>give any civil recognition to his visitors. Mr. Arthur
</p>
<p>respectfully told him the occasion of the call, where-
</p>
<p>upon Mr. Harris said in a petulant manner, that he
</p>
<p>did not propose to have any pope come here to inter-

</p>
<p>fere with him and his engineers. Mr. Arthur told
</p>
<p>44 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>him he did not come here as a pope, but as a gentle-
</p>
<p>man, and he expected to meet one, and in the hope
</p>
<p>that they could together fix up the differences and have
</p>
<p>peace. Mr. Harris : " If that is the case, we will hear
</p>
<p>what you have to say," still pacing the floor.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur: "Sit down then; I cannot talk to a
</p>
<p>man's back."
</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur then went over the complaints of the
</p>
<p>men, some of which were so grossly unjustifiable that
</p>
<p>Mr. Harris said they should be remedied. The classi-
</p>
<p>fication system was reduced from four years to three.
</p>
<p>Mr. F. A. Chase, Division 32, was uncompromising
</p>
<p>in his censures of the company. He would yield noth-
</p>
<p>ing; not an iota. But for him, good terms could have
</p>
<p>been made, and the almost complete failure of the com-
</p>
<p>mittee turned on the violence of his feelings. Said he
</p>
<p>to Mr. Arthur, "If I should go home and tell my wife
</p>
<p>that I had given in to the company, she would disown
</p>
<p>me." He was so radical as to disable the others. No
</p>
<p>satisfactory agreement could be reached. No better
</p>
<p>conditions could, in his presence, be made. The fav-
</p>
<p>oring moment went by. On December 20, this com-
</p>
<p>mitteeman wrote a letter to his division, begging of
</p>
<p>them the kindest feeling they could command towards
</p>
<p>him, expressing great fear of their disrespect, and ask-
</p>
<p>ing to be allowed to withdraw from the Order. A
</p>
<p>few words will complete his history as a committee-
</p>
<p>man : After he began his duties in the committee, he
</p>
<p>took a ride with Mr. Chalender, the master mechanic
</p>
<p>of- the road, in which ride, he said afterwards, the
</p>
<p>grievance business was not mentioned. Then in the

<p>committee he was so radical as to defeat his fellow
</p>
<p>BURLINGTON POLICY DEFINED. 45
</p>
<p>members. Immediately he withdrew from the Order,
</p>
<p>after receiving for his time and expenses $96.87. Then
</p>
<p>honors and promotions began to shower upon him
</p>
<p>from the company. Very soon he obtained an engine
</p>
<p>on a passenger train, though not entitled to it from age
</p>
<p>in service; then he was foreman of the round house at
</p>
<p>Aurora, afterward master mechanic at St. Joseph.
</p>
<p>His conversion from Brotherhood to Burlington was
</p>
<p>as sudden as St. Paul's, and like that eminent martyr,
</p>
<p>his zeal was greater in his second consecration than in
</p>
<p>his first, and all that without a scrap of the material of
</p>
<p>which martyrs are made. The company showed great
</p>
<p>skill in using means to break up the committee by
</p>
<p>discharge or otherwise, but did not often succeed.
</p>
<p>The result of this appeal to the company was not re-
</p>
<p>ceived with good grace, and it united all concerned in
</p>
<p>a determination to effect a change for the better,
</p>
<p>which resulted in a strike and suspension of business

<p>CHAPTER XL
</p>
<p>THE STRIKE OF 1877.
</p>
<p>A call was made for a meeting at Burlington, to
</p>
<p>which all class of train men responded, and a commit-
</p>
<p>tee was appointed to present their requests to the Com-
</p>
<p>pany. Then commenced the usual maneuvers of
</p>
<p>officials to intimidate by threats of discharge, etc. They
</p>
<p>had posted a notice that unless the men came to the
</p>
<p>office and signed, ready to go to work, that after
</p>
<p>such an hour they could consider themselves dis-
</p>
<p>charged. 1
</p>
<p>Wheaton and Belknap, in their famous circular of
</p>
<p>1888, charge the engineers with bad faith, but the
</p>
<p>charge is not sustained by the documents before me,
</p>
<p>or by living witnesses who were participants. Both
</p>
<p>factions charge bad faith which was probably true of a
</p>
<p>few men. This is always the case in such trials of
</p>
<p>character. It is said that " self preservation is the first
</p>
<p>law of nature, " and we find this principle actuating
</p>
<p>men in an inverse ratio to the character they possess
</p>
<p> the less of character the more of preservation. It is
</p>
<p>not often that a bad man performs good deeds.
</p>
<p>The side tracks were blocked with cars ; the Chicago
</p>
<p>end of the line being tied up in consequence of the spread
</p>
<p>of the great Pennsylvania strike of that year. A

</p>
<p>man, conductor and brakeman were obliged to flee for
</p>
<p>their lives. Women, children and men, of all kinds
</p>
<p>and colors, swarmed in the yards, and threw stones
</p>
<p>and all sorts of missiles at the men. They had no in-
</p>
<p>terest in the railroad, but had taken the fever and were
</p>
<p>ready to commit any depredations against a railroad,
</p>
<p>even to kill its employes.
</p>
<p>The Burlington Company knew this could not last
</p>
<p>and that they must get their own troubles over in some
</p>
<p>manner, so that they would have men to do business with.
</p>
<p>The men at Creston, Iowa, had an understanding with
</p>
<p>W. P. Montgomery, the committeeman at Burlington,
</p>
<p>that no notices would be received by them unless the in-
</p>
<p>itials of his name were reversed to P. W. Montgomery.
</p>
<p>Mr. Potter, then superintendent of the Iowa lines,
</p>
<p>sent telegrams to Creston telling the men that all was
</p>
<p>settled, and signed Mr. Montgomery's name, but not
</p>
<p>knowing the understanding about the signature did
</p>
<p>not sign it right, and the men would not believe it was
</p>
<p>authentic.
</p>
<p>Some of the conductors started for Burlington with
</p>
<p>a hand car and the engineers demanded an engine and
</p>
<p>way car to go and see the committee themselves,
</p>
<p>which was finally given them. Such was the condi-
</p>
<p>tion of doubt and mistrust all along the line. July 27,
</p>
<p>the following letter was written, to wit:
</p>
<p>Chicago, Burlington and Quincy R. R. Co.
</p>
<p>Office Division Superintendent.
</p>
<p>Burlington, Iowa, July 27, 1877.

</p>
<p>delay, that they in common with other employes
</p>
<p>shall not be discharged for any participation in the
</p>
<p>present strike. And that any grievance, either set
</p>
<p>forth in writing, or by word of mouth, presented to
</p>
<p>the manager of the road, shall receive a respectful
</p>
<p>hearing, and action shall be taken in the matter with-
</p>
<p>in a reasonable time.
</p>
<p>C. E. Perkins,
</p>
<p>Vice-President.
</p>
<p>It is certain that not much respect was intended in
</p>
<p>this letter. It was evidently addressed to the com-
</p>
<p>mittee representing the Burlington employes, but no
</p>
<p>complimentary address is either at the beginning or
</p>
<p>end, and the conductors are not mentioned at all.
</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins is autocratic, and yielded this much be-
</p>
<p>cause of a necessity. But this did not cure the diffi-
</p>
<p>culty, although it might have had a tendency to in-
</p>
<p>duce them to accept the promise that was made in the
</p>
<p>name of Robert Harris, general manager, in a dis-
</p>
<p>patch received at Aurora, promising that if the men
</p>
<p>would go to work, as soon as the panic was over
</p>
<p>their pay should be adjusted satisfactorily, and
</p>
<p>signed  Robert Harris, general manager. The
</p>
<p>men having great confidence in Mr Harris, accepted
</p>
<p>his proposition in good faith, and sent the following

<p>CHAPTER XII.
</p>
<p>INCREASING IRREGULARITIES.
</p>
<p>Everything moved off again as though there had
</p>
<p>been no differences existing, all feeling that the promises
</p>
<p>would be fulfilled, but as time passed and business re-
</p>
<p>sumed its former briskness, doubt began to take the
</p>
<p>place of confidence, and the men began to inquire into
</p>
<p>the cause, and they were told by those who were in a
</p>
<p>position to know, that Mr. Harris did not make the
</p>
<p>promise, but that superintendent Strong did, using Mr.
</p>
<p>Harris's name ; and that Mr. Harris, on being informed
</p>
<p>of the action taken, said he never made any promises
</p>
<p>he did not fulfill, and that the adjustment must be
</p>
<p>made. 1 In consequence of this, Mr. Harris was noti-
</p>
<p>fied that his resignation would be accepted, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Harris resigned and went to St. Louis, Rock Island &
</p>
<p>Chicago road, and Mr. W. B. Strong was appointed
</p>
<p>in his place; Arthur A. Hobart in Mr. Strong's place. 2
</p>
<p>This ended the promise, and the classification established
</p>
<p>by the order of October 10, 1876 still stood. The
</p>
<p>official plans were laid and carried out without regard
</p>
<p>to personal obligations, and with utter disregard for
</p>
<p>truth, but in a direct line with all their dealing with
</p>
<p>their employes.
</p>
<p>Mr. Harris was out of the way, and a policy was in-
</p>
<p>augurated of getting rid of  in some manner  the
</p>
<p>presumed leaders of any movement for the better condi-
</p>
<p>tion of the employe. At this time, Mr. L. E. Johnson,

<p>who, the reader will remember, was chairman of the
</p>
<p>grievance committee who waited on Mr. Harris in
</p>
<p>1873, was made foreman at Ottumwa in the early part
</p>
<p>of 1S78, and Mr. Chase was provided with a passen-
</p>
<p>ger train, and later was made foreman at Aurora; en-
</p>
<p>listing these two  who had been a thorn in their side
</p>
<p>as representatives of the Brotherhood  on the side of
</p>
<p>the company.
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson was expelled for non-payment of dues, 1
</p>
<p>and Mr. Chase demanded a withdrawal card immedi-
</p>
<p>ately after serving on the committee of 1876, and of
</p>
<p>all the official force of the Burlington, no greater dem-
</p>
<p>agogues were found than these two who had turned
</p>
<p>their back on the Brotherhood, and having got a
</p>
<p>place, undertook to prove to the company their sin-
</p>
<p>cere conversion.
</p>
<p>After being deceived in 1877, no further united ef-
</p>
<p>fort was attempted until 1881, when Division 112, sit-
</p>
<p>uated at Creston, asked that a committee be appointed
</p>
<p>from each division and to try again to cure the evil condi-
</p>
<p>tions of pay, but they did not succeed, as only the main
</p>
<p>line proper had organizations, and some of them were
</p>
<p>disgusted at the result of the 1877 effort. The St.
</p>
<p>Louis Division, from Rock Island to St. Louis, 249
</p>
<p>miles, was not organized. L. E. Johnson was trans-
</p>
<p>ferred from Ottumwa as foreman, to Beardstown as
</p>
<p>master mechanic of this division, and under his man-
</p>
<p>agement the grievances were very numerous. It was
</p>
<p>his delight to lay the men off for the most trivial offen-
</p>
<p>ses, whether accidental or careless, and the men were
</p>
<p>paid as best suited the local officers, without any uni-
</p>
<p>form standard. 2 To illustrate: from Beardstown to

</p>
<p>Monmouth, seventy-two miles, the engineer was paid
</p>
<p>$2.55. If it took seven hours or twenty-four hours,
</p>
<p>the pay was the same. They would start out on a
</p>
<p>through Monmouth run, and on arrival at Astoria coal
</p>
<p>mines, would be stopped and made to switch from three
</p>
<p>to five hours, without pay.
</p>
<p>In the fall of 1881, Johnson was transferred to Au-
</p>
<p>rora, and A. Forsyth was appointed to the place va-
</p>
<p>cated at Beardstown, but this did not improve matters.
</p>
<p>At this time, one W. K. Hollis was appointed round-
</p>
<p>house foreman at Beardstown. This man Hollis had
</p>
<p>been a member of Division No. 38, at Baltimore; had
</p>
<p>served on grievance committee for that division, and
</p>
<p>in that capacity made demands on the company con-
</p>
<p>trary to his instructions, and the officers found him out
</p>
<p>and discharged him. This action on his part broke
</p>
<p>up the division, which had some $200 in its treasurv,
</p>
<p>and owned its furniture, and Hollis was charged with
</p>
<p>making way with it, for which he was expelled. This
</p>
<p>man being put in an official position on this division,
</p>
<p>did not tend to allay the irritation the men felt, but
</p>
<p>rather had a tendency to increase it. Yet they had no
</p>
<p>means of redress until after the organization of Divis-
</p>
<p>ion 127, at Beardstown, in 1882. There was a few
</p>
<p>brotherhood men there, but, anticipating dismissal
</p>
<p>for any aggressive move thev might make, said noth-
</p>
<p>ing, until in July, 1882, when a committee was appoint-
</p>
<p>ed to wait on master mechanic Forsvth, in regard to
</p>
<p>their engines being taken to East St. Louis yard, as
</p>
<p>had been previously done by the hostler. It took from
</p>
<p>thirty minutes to one hour to do this work, and the

<p>THE CONDITION OF TRAINMEN MADE WORSE.
</p>
<p>Evils existed all along the line of the Burlington,
</p>
<p>but the organization was too weak to resist. They
</p>
<p>were of such an irritating nature that the thoughts of
</p>
<p>the men were always in the direction of securing some
</p>
<p>means by which redress could be had, and at the
</p>
<p>convention held in Louisville, in October, all the repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives from the Burlington met and adopted plans
</p>
<p>tor the grievance committee of 1883, which committee
</p>
<p>met in Burlington, March 27, and elected Chas. Fish-
</p>
<p>er, of Creston, Iowa, chairman. This committee, met
</p>
<p>Mr. T. J. Potter, general manager, and H. B. Stone,
</p>
<p>the .general superintendent, who refused to grant any
</p>
<p>concessions, and the sitting culminated in hot words be-
</p>
<p>tween Mr. Potter and the committeeman from Divis-
</p>
<p>ion 107. Great complaint was made on account of
</p>
<p>overwork without pay. Mr. Potter gave the men no
</p>
<p>satisfaction on this point, but after they were gone he
</p>
<p>told the officers of the Kansas City, St. Joseph &
</p>
<p>Council Bluffs railroad, that if the men made any more
</p>
<p>fuss about delayed time they could allow it, but that
</p>

<p>compelling power, and Mr. Potter knew the numerical
</p>
<p>strength of the committee's backing. The Grand
</p>
<p>Chief, P. M. Arthur, met with this committee, and ad-
</p>
<p>vised that they go home and get all the men together,
</p>
<p>and let them know the indifference manifested by the
</p>
<p>officials, put new energy into their efforts to increase
</p>
<p>their number, and when two-thirds of the men were
</p>
<p>members, the} 7 would try again.
</p>
<p>To head off this effort, George Calkins was ordered
</p>
<p>discharged in July, and on August 5, a committee was
</p>
<p>appointed (by Division 32, of Aurora, of which Mr. Cal-
</p>
<p>kins was a member) which was instructed to wait on
</p>
<p>Mr. L. E. Johnson (the same man who was chairman
</p>
<p>of the grievance committee of 1873, now master me-
</p>
<p>chanic at Aurora,) and ascertain the cause of Mr. Cal-
</p>
<p>kins discharge. Mr. Johnson said that Mr. Calkins
</p>
<p>was discharged for being too earnest a worker for the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. On Mr. Cal-
</p>
<p>kins being discharged, the chairman of the general
</p>
<p>grievance committee, Mr. Chas. Fisher, of Creston,
</p>
<p>addressed a letter to all divisions along the line, asking
</p>
<p>them to vote on the question of whether they would
</p>
<p>make an effort to reinstate Mr. Calkins. For this ac-
</p>
<p>tive part taken by Mr. Fisher, Mr. T.J. Potter ordered
</p>
<p>his discharge, and in the fore part of August, votes
</p>
<p>were taken to sustain these men; but the fear of dis-
</p>
<p>missal and the realization of a lack of power to carry
</p>
<p>all the men with them, (only about one-half being mem-
</p>
<p>bers) the case was never brought to an issue. The
</p>
<p>convention, in October, paid to each, three months
</p>
<p>salary, and Mr. Calkins was paid until he obtained an-

</p>
<p>as engineer since.
</p>
<p>All this time the corporation screw was being tight-
</p>
<p>ened. Efforts were made at local points to correct lo-
</p>
<p>cal affairs, but always with the same results. Times
</p>
<p>were dull and every division officer was trying to make
</p>
<p>a better showing than his neighbour on another divis-
</p>
<p>ion. On the St. Louis division, Mr. Forsyth in 1884,
</p>
<p>concluded to do away with hostlers at Monmouth and
</p>
<p>make the engine men clean the fires and put away
</p>
<p>their own engines in the roundhouse without pay.
</p>
<p>The local committee waited on him, and as this, like
</p>
<p>most other evils, emanated from some local official, he
</p>
<p>was induced to leave the hostler.
</p>
<p>They then increased the number of cars so that the
</p>
<p>men would have to double on the hills. Not being able
</p>
<p>to pull all the cars they would have to take part of them
</p>
<p>and go to the next station and set them on the siding,
</p>
<p>and come back and get the other part and then couple
</p>
<p>up and go on. Perhaps they would have this to do
</p>
<p>several times during the trip, and without any addi-
</p>
<p>tional pay. This is dangerous work, as many accidents
</p>
<p>happen going down grade after these parts, and mam-
</p>
<p>men have been discharged in consequence. They
</p>
<p>tried to cure this, but were told that they only had the
</p>
<p>regular number of cars. The men knew that the
</p>
<p>number had been increased to get this work done for
</p>
<p>nothing, but they could not help themselves..
</p>
<p>Every act of this kind tended to increase their pow-
</p>
<p>er, as the men found there was no redress except in
</p>
<p>organized effort.

<p>CHAPTER XIV.
</p>
<p>PURSUING A SUPERINTENDENT.
</p>
<p>No further effort of note was made until Feb. i,
</p>
<p>1885, when Division 32, situated at Aurora, made a
</p>
<p>call for representatives from the various divisions loca-
</p>
<p>ted along the system to meet in Burlington on March
</p>
<p>3, 1885, which was responded to by J. C. Porter, of Au-
</p>
<p>rora, Div. 32;Heimerof Galesburg, 62; O'Brien of Keo-
</p>
<p>kuk, 56; Kirch of Creston, 112; and Fowler of Burling-
</p>
<p>ton, 151. Divisions 79, 98, 107, 127, 164, 271 and 290
</p>
<p>were not represented. They made a temporary or-
</p>
<p>ganization, with P. O'Brien as temporary chairman,
</p>
<p>and Wm. Fowler as temporary secretary. Commun-
</p>
<p>ications were read from nearly all the other points not
</p>
<p>represented in person.
</p>
<p>The men along the line had evidently not forgotten
</p>
<p>what befell their predecessors for serving on commit-
</p>
<p>tee, and one of the letters states, in the following lan-
</p>
<p>guage that "It is going to be a hard matter to send a
</p>
<p>man from here to organize or meet with a general
</p>
<p>grievance committee, for the man that goes from here
</p>
<p>will be discharged, if found out. You may think
</p>
<p>this strange, but if any engineer lays off he must get a
</p>
<p>permit from the master mechanic if he wants to leave
</p>
<p>town. I write this to show you how we are fixed
</p>
<p>since the last time the committee met in Burlington,
</p>
<p>but we will get there in some shape." 1

</p>
<p>of 1883, they arrived at the natural conclusion that very
</p>
<p>little could be done without a concert of action on the
</p>
<p>part of all interested, and they concluded to refer the
</p>
<p>whole matter to the delegates to the convention to be
</p>
<p>held at New Orleans in October. Accordincdv, the
</p>
<p>temporary chairman, Mr. O'Brien, of Keokuk, reported
</p>
<p>this meeting, with all the correspondence, to the con-
</p>
<p>vention at New Orleans, and this action resulted in a
</p>
<p>call, at that convention, for a meeting of the delegates
</p>
<p>of the C, B. & Q. R. R. which was held in room 282,
</p>
<p>of the St. Charles hotel, Oct. 24, 1885, and resulted in
</p>
<p>the formation of the committee of 1886, with J. C.
</p>
<p>Porter, of Aurora, as chairman, and L. E. Hinckley, of
</p>
<p>Galesburg, as secretarv.
</p>
<p>On Jan. 25, 1887, a call was made by the chairman for
</p>
<p>the committee to convene at Burlington on the 22nd day
</p>
<p>of February, 1886, for the transaction of such business
</p>
<p>as might properly come before it . On the assembling
</p>
<p>of the committee, it was found that nearly all had ex-
</p>
<p>tensive reports of local affairs, consisting of delayed
</p>
<p>time, which they were obliged to perform without re-
</p>
<p>remuneration, men laid off without cause, others dis-
</p>
<p>charged, and many otherwise annoyed, none of which
</p>
<p>they had been unable to correct with their local offi-
</p>
<p>cers. There were volumes of this, especially from
</p>
<p>the representatives of the Burlington & Missouri, but
</p>
<p>it was decided that they did not properly come before
</p>
<p>this committee, and it was advised to try and secure
</p>
<p>some rules, and have them signed by the general man-
</p>
<p>ager or president, that would take the power out of
</p>
<p>the hands of the local officers to manipulate conditions

<p>to suit their own fancy.

<p>60 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>The men contended for the principles enunciated in
</p>
<p>a circular issued in 1888 to the officers of the Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania R. R. Company which says: "The employes
</p>
<p>of the Pennsylvania lines are compensated sufficiently
</p>
<p>to make them self-respecting and reliable, and -are dis-
</p>
<p>ciplined to the highest standard. A powerful preven-
</p>
<p>tive of discord is that men filling the highest offices
</p>
<p>are expected to consider themselves employes as well
</p>
<p>as the humblest subordinates, are instructed to follow
</p>
<p>their orders to the letter, and pay due respect to their
</p>
<p>superiors; and at the same time superior officers are
</p>
<p>required to be considerate and just in intercourse with
</p>
<p>subordinates." ' Unfortunately both for the financial in-
</p>
<p>terest, as well as for the employes, of the Burlington,
</p>
<p>there were no rules that required the officers to be
</p>
<p>considerate and just. But an appointment to office, in
</p>
<p>the mind of the appointee, carried with it unlimited in-
</p>
<p>dividual rights, to have and to do as seemed best
</p>
<p>suited to the individual interests and disposition of the
</p>
<p>individual so appointed.
</p>
<p>Those who have not given this subject thought, lit-
</p>
<p>tle realize the contentions that emanate from the un-
</p>
<p>limited exercise of personal prerogative, through the
</p>
<p>999 grades of necessary officials of a great railroad
</p>
<p>corporation. A section foreman as an officer in com-
</p>
<p>mand of his squad, hires and discharges men. He can
</p>
<p>be as autocratic as a king, and there is no redress,
</p>
<p>except to leave the service, or to appeal to higher
</p>
<p>authority.
</p>
<p>A foreman of a roundhouse may suspend engineers
</p>
<p>and firemen. He may take away any rights earned

<p>erally governed by his likes and dislikes, regardless of

<p>the good of the service, and an appeal to a higher
</p>
<p>authority becomes necessary.
</p>
<p>A division master mechanic may discharge, suspend,
</p>
<p>or assess for damage, for any infraction of rules, and
</p>
<p>be governed, not by principle, but by personality or
</p>
<p>by a grudge ; not as a direct beneficiary, but to decrease
</p>
<p>the expense of his division; to make a more favorable
</p>
<p>showing than other master mechanics of the same

<p>system, in order to make sure his own place or a bet-
</p>
<p>ter one.
</p>
<p>Train masters and superintendents scattered along
</p>
<p>the 6000 miles of the Burlington, each trying to outdo
</p>
<p>the other in cheapening transportation, lessening the
</p>
<p>cost of material by assessing the employ for damages
</p>
<p>to rolling stock, or for stock killed; increasing the
</p>
<p>number of cars in the train until they cannot be hand-
</p>
<p>led by the men without doubling the hills, necessita-
</p>
<p>ting additional work and danger without additional pay.
</p>
<p>The list of encroachments and unwarranted exactions
</p>
<p>might be strung out almost indefinitely, but so long as
</p>
<p>they increased the dividends they were always sanc-
</p>
<p>tioned by the management; and they invariably re-

<p>practice in order to indicate one of the methods by

<p>which discontent and resentment may readily be en-

<p>gendered among a large number of employes.
</p>
<p>They see their extremities taken advantage of, and

<p>submit to it because their necessities do not permit

<p>them the luxury of revolt, but they can hardly be ex-

<p>The committee composed of J. C. Porter, of Aurora,
</p>
<p>111., chairman; L. E. Hinckley, of Galesburg, 111., sec-
</p>
<p>retary: John A. Beaureisen, of Aurora, 111.; Charles

<p>W. T. Odell, of Chicago, 111. As this committee was
</p>
<p>general in its nature, their efforts were directed to-
</p>
<p>wards formulating rules that would apply to the

<p>whole system. They had provided themselves with

<p>the schedules and fixed conditions of all the roads

<p>presented to the general manager. The committee ad-

<p>superintendent, requesting an appointment, and the
</p>
<p>communication was answered by the chief clerk, stat-
</p>
<p>ing that Mr. Stone was out of town, and he was re-
</p>
<p>quested to forward the dispatch and obtain an answer
</p>
<p>if possible. An answer was received Tuesday morn-
</p>
<p>ing, appointing 3:00 p. m., March 3, for the confer-
</p>
<p>ence. The committee was admitted at the appointed
</p>
<p>time, and a two hour's sitting was had, in which Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone said he could not consider the Hannibal & St.
</p>
<p>Joseph; the Kansas City, St. Joseph & Council Bluffs;
</p>
<p>or the Burlington & Missouri, and wanted the commit-
</p>
<p>tee to cut these lines out of the consideration, which
</p>
<p>they properly refused to do. The conditions most com-
</p>
<p>plained of were placed on these lines by the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton's authority, but Mr. Stone denied having the power
</p>
<p>to take them away. The committee then retired to
</p>
<p>their quarters at the Grand Pacific Hotel and sent a
</p>
<p>request to General Manager T. J. Potter, stating that
</p>
<p>they had had an audience with Mr. Stone, and that he
</p>
<p>had declared the leased lines out of his jurisdiction,
</p>
<p>and asked an audience with him at his earliest conven-
</p>
<p>ience. As soon as the committee made its appearance
</p>
<p>at headquarters, Mr. Potter arranged to leave the
</p>
<p>city, Mr. Stone stating that he would probably be away
</p>
<p>for a fortnight.
</p>
<p>This the committee took for a part of an understand-
</p>
<p>ing between the two to discourage them. But they were
</p>
<p>not in a temper to be discouraged. Mr. Potter went
</p>
<p>to St. Louis and started from there on a tour of in-
</p>
<p>spection of the whole line of the Burlington, for the evi-
</p>
<p>dent purpose of evading a meeting with this commit-

<p>represented by this committee. The telegram from
</p>
<p>the committee to Mr. Potter was handed to him on
</p>
<p>his way from St. Louis to Burlington. He answered,
</p>
<p>saying he was on his way to Colorado, on a business
</p>
<p>trip, and that it would not be convenient to meet them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Potter was then asked to delay his departure for
</p>
<p>one day, that there were fourteen of the committee and
</p>
<p>they had come to see the officers. Mr. Potter answered
</p>
<p>on the morning of March 5, stating that business en-
</p>
<p>gagments would make it necessary for him to go to
</p>
<p>Colorado, and he would appoint March 20, for a meet-
</p>
<p>ing in Chicago, and asked the committee to see Super-
</p>
<p>intendent Stone and he would furnish transportation to
</p>
<p>their respective homes and return on the above date.
</p>
<p>But this committee had not forgotten the fate of the
</p>
<p>committee of 1883, ' and did not propose to go home
</p>
<p>and have part, or the whole of the committee, dis-
</p>
<p>charged to break it up, as was then done, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Potter was answered that the committee had come to stav
</p>
<p>until its business was transacted, and they would await
</p>
<p>his return. This brought another telegram from Mr.
</p>
<p>Potter, saying that business of great importance and of
</p>
<p>previous engagements would prevent his meeting
</p>
<p>them until the day appointed. The committee saw
</p>
<p>behind this a ruse to keep out of the way, and it was
</p>
<p>learned that he was in Burlington long enough to
</p>
<p>have complied with the request, if he so desired. The
</p>
<p>action of the general manager made it necessary for
</p>
<p>the committee to remain in Chicago fifteen days.
</p>
<p>On Sunday, March 7, the local officers were
</p>
<p>congregated in Burlington discussing the situation and

<p>who had been asking an increase of pay, and the com-
</p>
<p>mittee was informed that the officers decided to make
</p>
<p>a reduction of the engineer's pay, and add it to that
</p>
<p>of the conductor's, but Mr. Potter was reported as
</p>
<p>saying, "We will have to advance wages ioper cent."
</p>
<p>On March 10, one of the committee was in Aurora
</p>
<p>and on his return reported that the officials were con-
</p>
<p>gregating at Aurora, and it was evident that the com-
</p>
<p>mittee of fourteen had to contend with the combined
</p>
<p>official talent of the Burlington system. On the 6th a
</p>
<p>letter was sent the Grand Chief Engineer of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood of Engineers, P. M. Arthur, which was
</p>
<p>answered on the 8th, saying to the committee:
</p>
<p>"Have the men vote on the whole system, whether
</p>
<p>they will sustain you in whatever action you deem
</p>
<p>advisable. Avoid all outside discussion of your griev-
</p>
<p>ances. Keep your own council, and when you have
</p>
<p>exhausted all your efforts, and want my services, wire
</p>
<p>me and I will come at once." ' P. M. Arthur, Grand
</p>
<p>Chief Engineer.
</p>
<p>The grievance committee, in their preparation to
</p>
<p>meet the Burlington officers, appointed sub-commit-
</p>
<p>tees and sent them to each railroad centering in Chi-
</p>
<p>cago, to obtain a schedule of wages paid on road and
</p>
<p>in yard service, for comparison with the Burlington.
</p>
<p>The methods of the committee were so quiet that the
</p>
<p>reporters did not know they were in Chicago until
</p>
<p>about ten days after their arrival. Correspondence was
</p>
<p>kept up with the Grand Chief Engineer, and he

</p>
<p>Potter is rapidly approaching, and the best advice I
</p>
<p>can give at this stage of the proceedings is to meet
</p>
<p>him in a spirit of fairness. If he does the same you
</p>
<p>will effect a settlement honorable to both sides. If he
</p>
<p>is stubborn and will not make any concessions, go at
</p>
<p>once to the president. If he refuses to do anything,
</p>
<p>send for me, and I will see what I can do. If you can-
</p>
<p>not obtain all you ask for in the schedule drawn up,
</p>
<p>then compromise on something near it. It is far better
</p>
<p>to do that than to resort to coercion. I have sufficient
</p>
<p>confidence in your committee, that they will do what is
</p>
<p>fair and just between the company and the men. Let
</p>
<p>us hope for the best, and rely upon our manhood and
</p>
<p>providence for our success. I have declined to go to
</p>
<p>Corsicana, Texas, until your case is settled. With
</p>
<p>kind regards to all, I remain,

</p>
<p>General Manager Potter went over the whole sys-
</p>
<p>tem to Denver, and on the way questioned the local
</p>
<p>officials as to the numerical strength of the brother-
</p>
<p>hoods, and their sentiment, and upon his arrival in
</p>
<p>Chicago, on March 19, knew what he had to contend
</p>
<p>with. But he was as well prepared as one could be,
</p>
<p>for defense of his side of the question.

</p>
<p>THE COUNCIL OF WAR.
</p>
<p>At the appointed time, March 20, the committee were
</p>
<p>invited to Mr. Potter's office, and after the usual intro-
</p>
<p>ductions and recognitions of old acquaintances, we
</p>
<p>entered upon the subject of the meeting. Mr. Potter,
</p>
<p>like Mr. Stone, took the ground of supply and demand,
</p>
<p>and asked why they did not go to some other railroad
</p>
<p>if the pay was not satisfactory. 1 The principle of sup-
</p>
<p>ply and demand in an open market is deemed a com-
</p>
<p>mercial balance. But labor employed by a large cor-
</p>
<p>poration is subject to the will of the money power, the
</p>
<p>same as the poor are affected by a corner on wheat.
</p>
<p>The scope of the control is such that there is virtually
</p>
<p>but one market, and if labor withdraws from the ser-
</p>
<p>vice of a railroad corporation six thousand miles long,
</p>
<p>it must go perhaps hundreds of miles to find a new
</p>
<p>market.
</p>
<p>Section men's pay is reduced to 95 cents per day by
</p>
<p>the order of a general manager of the Burlington,
</p>
<p>when common labor is worth $1.25 on the market.
</p>
<p>The section man having no power of redress, and be-
</p>
<p>ing ignorant of other business, has no alternative but
</p>
<p>to submit. The Jute Trust increased the price of
</p>
<p>manufactured jute 50 per cent, while the labor which
</p>
<p>produced it was at the pauper point, and received no
</p>
<p>benefit from the advance. The consumer looked for
</p>
<p>another market but found nothing but Jute trust Jute.

<p>and resorted to substitutes, and state legislatures.
</p>
<p>But where is labor's substitute, or legislative in-
</p>
<p>fluence ? It has neither, and must submit to the inev-
</p>
<p>itable result of combined capital.
</p>
<p>Mr Potter was manager of the Burlington system,
</p>
<p>and all its leased lines, yet he, as Mr. Stone had
</p>
<p>done, denied having authority to fix the pay and change
</p>
<p>the conditions complained of. But he would make things
</p>
<p>pleasant east of the Mississippi if the committee would
</p>
<p>drop the Burlington & Missouri and the other leased
</p>
<p>lines, which the committee again refused to do. Mr.
</p>
<p>Potter was asked if there was any official higher than
</p>
<p>he was that could settle with the whole system, 1 and he
</p>
<p>answered that he had as much authority as any one.
</p>
<p>He denied the right of the Chicago & Iowa railroad
</p>
<p>to be represented, but he was obliged to acknowledge
</p>
<p>that he was vice-president of that road. He argued
</p>
<p>that it was not fair of the men to ask a uniform pay,
</p>
<p>as the conditions and expense of living varied; that,
</p>
<p>for example, a man ought to have better pay in Ne-
</p>
<p>braska and Colorado than in Illinois, because it costs
</p>
<p>more to live there. Mr. Hoge, of McCook, asked
</p>
<p>why the company refused to pay as much in Nebraska
</p>
<p>as they do in Illinois, and Mr. Potter had to acknowl-
</p>
<p>edge a strong point made against him. He was not
</p>
<p>practicing what he preached. The committee had the
</p>
<p>schedule with them which they had consumed so much
</p>
<p>time in preparing, but they thought best not to pre-
</p>
<p>sent it unless Mr. Potter would consent to treat with
</p>
<p>all concerned. Mr. Potter asked if the plan of sched-
</p>
<p>ule which we had made out, contemplated the abolition
</p>
<p>of classification, and he was aswered by the chairman,

</p>
<p>Mr. Porter, that it did. Mr. Potter called it apprentice
</p>
<p>pay-
</p>
<p>it will be remembered that the committee of 1876
</p>
<p>asked that apprentice pay be restored, and classifica-
</p>
<p>tion done away with. Apprenticeship, as practiced
</p>
<p>by all trades, has in it the principle of equity, the con-
</p>
<p>ditions being fixed by common consent, while classifi-
</p>
<p>cation represents the power to fix conditions without
</p>
<p>regard to equity. 1 The committee told Mr. Potter of
</p>
<p>many of the evils of classification and its abuses by lo-
</p>
<p>cal officers, and Mr. Potter said : " Officers, a good
</p>
<p>many times, make mistakes and do things they had not
</p>
<p>ought to do." Yet he could not make that change,
</p>
<p>and said: "Fancy pay is the cause of so many roads
</p>
<p>going into the hands of a receiver." The Burlington
</p>
<p>company had been selling rebate tickets, from Kansas
</p>
<p>City to Chicago, which, after the rebate was paid, left
</p>
<p>the company 50 cents each. The committee asked
</p>
<p>Mr. Potter whether this did not conduce to more re-
</p>
<p>ceivers than any kind of pay. 2 Mr. Potter said: " Offi-
</p>
<p>cials get mad as well as any body, and do foolish things,
</p>
<p>which to us, is only a strike of one capital against an-
</p>
<p>other. They do not think that they get their propor-
</p>
<p>tion of the pool." Where then, was Mr. Potter's prin-
</p>
<p>ciple of supply and demand ? The meeting closed at
</p>
<p>noon to convene at 2 :30 p. m. Mr. Potter said he did
</p>
<p>not think he could consider classification on the leased
</p>
<p>lines, and closed by asking : " Now your demands are,
</p>
<p>an equalization of pay, and doing away with classifica-
</p>
<p>tion."

<p>1 Order of Oct. 10, 1876. - Quotation of a member of Committee.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVI.
</p>
<p>SKIRMISHING FOR POSITION.
</p>
<p>Promptly at 2:30 p. m., all parties being present, the
</p>
<p>discussion was continued, Mr. Potter taking positive
</p>
<p>ground upon the two points of his last* question at the
</p>
<p>adjournment of the previous meetings  equalization of
</p>
<p>pay, and classification. He did not try to defend the
</p>
<p>justice of the position, but knew the financial advan-
</p>
<p>tages and considered them of great importance. The
</p>
<p>committee contended for the justice of their position
</p>
<p>with pertinacity, and knowing all the evils of the law
</p>
<p>and the abuses by the local officers in its application,
</p>
<p>had Mr. Potter in deep water as far as argument went. 1
</p>
<p>He asked whether the committee had come with a
</p>
<p>positive ultimatum. The chairman answered : " We
</p>
<p>onlv ask justice, and where injustice can be shown in
</p>
<p>our proposition, concessions will be readily made."
</p>
<p>After a silence of considerable length Mr. Potter
</p>
<p>asked if the committee expected to have uniform pay
</p>
<p>if the Company abandons classification, and he was
</p>
<p>answered, "Yes." Mr. Potter said, " I only asked the
</p>
<p>question to see how far apart we are." He contended
</p>
<p>that the financial condition of the Company would not
</p>
<p>admit of such changes, and consequent increase in ex-
</p>
<p>penses. One of the Committee produced the annual
</p>
<p>financial statement of the Company, showing they had
</p>
<p>collected "$26,172,819.54, and had a net income
</p>
<p>over operating expenses of $1 2,845,786.43." 2 Mr.

<p>SKIRMISHING FOR POSITION. 7 1
</p>
<p>Potter knew that the Burlington was one of the best
</p>
<p>dividend-paying roads in the country.
</p>
<p>The Committee had been away from their homes
</p>
<p>thirty days, and were anxious to come to some kind of
</p>
<p>an understanding. They had discussed the matter and
</p>
<p>concluded to divide the difference on classification;
</p>
<p>the men to give one year and the company one year,
</p>
<p>the one year based on second year pay. Mr. Potter
</p>
<p>was not inclined to compromise. The pay of the fire-
</p>
<p>men was discussed, and Mr. Potter asked what they
</p>
<p>wanted. The Committee told him, 55 per cent of the
</p>
<p>engineer's pay, and only one year of apprentice pay.
</p>
<p>Mr. Potter finally concluded to take the whole matter
</p>
<p>home and deliberate on its merits. The schedule had
</p>
<p>not been given to him because he had positively re-
</p>
<p>fused to consider the Burlington & Missouri, and other
</p>
<p>leased lines. But his expressed willingness to take up
</p>
<p>the whole subject was what the committee wanted, and
</p>
<p>he was then presented with the schedule. When this
</p>
<p>was given him he observed that he had expected the
</p>
<p>papers to be presented before, but he concluded he
</p>
<p>would not ask for them. He then proposed they ad-
</p>
<p>journ until 10:30 a. m. Sunday, which was agreed to.
</p>
<p>At the appointed time, Mr. Potter opened the dis-
</p>
<p>cussion by saying that he did not want to abolish clas-
</p>
<p>sification, or establish a uniform rate of pay, and he
</p>
<p>made this proposition: To call all the local officers in
</p>
<p>and go over the grounds of complaint. To which the
</p>
<p>chairman of the committee replied : " That might
</p>
<p>benefit a few, but would give us no rules to control
</p>
<p>the future. Local officers could change the conditions

<p>again to suit themselves, and we should be left just

</p>
<p>where we started." Mr. Potter said: "You are the
</p>
<p>judge on one side, and I am the judge on the other. I
</p>
<p>cannot concede the two main points, as it is against
</p>
<p>my principles, which are based on the laws of supply
</p>
<p>and demand."
</p>
<p>The Committee having conceded all that was con-
</p>
<p>sistent with their instruction from the men they repre-
</p>
<p>sented, told Mr. Potter thev would have to send for
</p>
<p>their Grand Chief Engineer, P. M. Arthur, the chair-
</p>
<p>man stating that though Mr. Potter conceded one year
</p>
<p>of classification, we are no nearer a settlement. Your
</p>
<p>whole line is closed against employment for engineers,
</p>
<p>in consequence of this law. 1 It was evident Mr. Pot-
</p>
<p>ter did not want a strike on his hands  he had too much
</p>
<p>business sagacity for that  yet he did not propose to
</p>
<p>give anything he was not compelled to give to prevent
</p>
<p>it. He said he did not like the idea of signing any
</p>
<p>agreement; " That is too much like giving the road over
</p>
<p>to the men to run." He objected to having Mr.
</p>
<p>Arthur, but finally consented to meet him. Then the
</p>
<p>committee retired and sent for Mr. Arthur, and he
</p>
<p>arrived on Monday morning.

<p>OF THE

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVII.
</p>
<p>THE TREATY OF PEACE OF l886.
</p>
<p>After meeting with the committee and advising
</p>
<p>moderation, Mr. Arthur and the chairman went to
</p>
<p>Mr. Potter's office, to arrange for a meeting, which
</p>
<p>was appointed for 2 =30 p. m. On the arrival of the
</p>
<p>committee at the Burlington offices, Mr. Arthur and
</p>
<p>the chairman again went into Mr. Potter's office.
</p>
<p>Whether Mr. Potter had changed his mind, or had
</p>
<p>adopted a new role was not known, but he had conclud-
</p>
<p>ed not to see the committee, saying it would do no
</p>
<p>good. However, he finally consented when the sched-
</p>
<p>ule was presented by Mr. Arthur, with the classification
</p>
<p>left out by the advice of the Grand Chief Engineer.
</p>
<p>This left only a uniform schedule of pay, and laws to
</p>
<p>govern subordinate officers. Still, with all the conces-
</p>
<p>sions that had been made by the committee, they
</p>
<p>seemed no nearer a settlement than at the first meet-
</p>
<p>ing. Mr. Potter said he would not adopt a uniform
</p>
<p>schedule, when Mr. Arthur said : " As you will do
</p>
<p>nothing, it is left with the men to say what thev will
</p>
<p>do. As grand chief, I cannot make them strike, but
</p>
<p>when my consent is given, it carries with it the consent
</p>
<p>of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers of the
</p>
<p>whole United States, Canada and Mexico." Mr. Pot-
</p>
<p>ter said: " Then they will strike if you give vour con-
</p>
<p>sent?" Mr. Arthur answered: '-Mr. Potter, you
</p>
<p>have had your own way so long, you think you must

</p>
<p>have it always. Now I will sanction a strike, and if
</p>
<p>you can hire men to run your engines you can do so,
</p>
<p>but the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers can pay
</p>
<p>as much to hire them not to run them." Mr. Potter
</p>
<p>evidently did not like this picture, and said he would
</p>
<p>submit a proposition, but he would want ten days.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur asked each one of the committee if he
</p>
<p>would grant the time, and each answered "No." It
</p>
<p>was evident to the committee that negotiations had
</p>
<p>come to an end, and all, including Mr. Potter, arose,
</p>
<p>taking their hats, when Mr. Potter said : " I have talked
</p>
<p>with the stockholders, and they say we cannot accept
</p>
<p>your schedule, because it would allow labor to dictate
</p>
<p>to capital." Then said Mr. Arthur, "I will give you
</p>
<p>forty-eight hours to make a proposition to us, and if
</p>
<p>reasonable we will accept it. That "will give you a
</p>
<p>ladder on which you can come down from your auto-
</p>
<p>cratic position." Mr . Potter said he could not do it
</p>
<p>in that time. He would have to call in all the officers,
</p>
<p>as he did not know enough about each run to make a
</p>
<p>schedule himself. Mr. Arthur said: " If you had any
</p>
<p>proposition to make you could have made it long ago.
</p>
<p>You have kept these men waiting around here for
</p>
<p>twenty days, without any good reason, but to be fair
</p>
<p>with you we will give you until Friday." Mr. Potter
</p>
<p>said he could be ready on Thursday, at 2 :30 p. m. He
</p>
<p>had made his point of not accepting any proposed
</p>
<p>change as dictated by labor, but to prevent finan-
</p>
<p>cial disasters, which he knew would be the inevit-
</p>
<p>able result of a strike, he had allowed, his autocratic
</p>
<p>position to become badly undermined and had consent-

</p>
<p>ed to have changes made in both rules and pay, and
</p>

</p>
<p>had signed them. Immediately after the close of this
</p>
<p>meeting, orders were sent in every direction for the
</p>
<p>superintendents and the master mechanics of all divis-
</p>
<p>ions, to come to Chicago for this conference. On their
</p>
<p>arrival, Mr. Potter set them at work, fixing up a prop-
</p>
<p>osition to present to the committee of engineers.
</p>
<p>At the appointed time, on Thursday, March 25, the
</p>
<p>committee was notified that Mr. Potter was ready to
</p>
<p>see them. The committeemen again wended their
</p>
<p>way to the manager's office, with patience and a strong-
</p>
<p>determination to follow the usual conservative course
</p>
<p>of the Brotherhood. Yet they were resolved, if pos-
</p>
<p>sible, to secure some kind of an agreement signed bv
</p>
<p>the general manager, as it would carry with it a recog-
</p>
<p>nition of the right of the laborer to be a voluntary party
</p>
<p>to any contract for work. Such an agreement would
</p>
<p>also be an official recognition of the Brotherhood.
</p>
<p>On arriving at the Burlington offices, the committee
</p>
<p>was invited into Mr. Potter's private office on the
</p>
<p>ground floor, and presented with the result of the lo-
</p>
<p>cal official deliberation. It had nothing in it to com-
</p>
<p>mend itself to the committee, and it was promptly re-
</p>

</p>
<p>he found that 95 per cent of the enginemen belonged
</p>
<p>to the two Orders, and he was anxious to prevent an
</p>
<p>issue with them. In pursuit of this policy, he asked if
</p>
<p>they would meet the local officers of their respective
</p>
<p>divisions, and take up each run and condition and see
</p>
<p>if they could not arrive at some conclusion. Mr. Pot-
</p>
<p>ter said he was astonished at the lack of ability of
</p>
<p>some of his local officers, and was satisfied they could

<p>not make a schedule. The committee consented to

<p>76 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>this and adjourned to meet them the next morning-.
</p>
<p>On Friday, March 26, the committee took the ele-
</p>
<p>vator at the Burlington headquarters and landed at
</p>
<p>the room which had been previously used as a meeting
</p>
<p>room, and met their respective officials. After the
</p>
<p>usual recognitions they proceeded to business. There
</p>
<p>were two officers to each grievance committee-
</p>
<p>man, and they divided off in squads of three, and
</p>
<p>took up the home work. They went over each run,
</p>
<p>and increased the pay very materially on many of the
</p>
<p>runs for both engineers and firemen, discussing delays
</p>
<p>and other evil conditions. The consent of the local offi-
</p>
<p>cials was given very reluctantly to these changes, and
</p>
<p>they should not, by any means, be credited to their
</p>
<p>liberality. Mr. Potter knew it was concessions or a
</p>
<p>strike, and the officials were brought in for the purpose
</p>
<p>of making them. The chief men delegated to their in-
</p>
<p>feriors the work of making the changes, but reserved
</p>
<p>the credit of being magnanimous. The committee
</p>
<p>work not being done at noon, the meeting adjourned
</p>
<p>until 2 :30 p. m., when time would suffice for all the
</p>
<p>runs to be considered. The rules were taken up and
</p>
<p>an agreement was finally reached. The meeting ad-
</p>
<p>journed until Saturday at 11 o'clock, to receive the sched-
</p>
<p>ules and rules which were being prepared by the Comp-
</p>
<p>any, and which would then be signed by its officers.
</p>
<p>We append here a note from Mr. Potter, accompany-

</p>
<p>When the committee went from Burlington to Chi-
</p>
<p>cago, they paid their fare and took receipts from the
</p>
<p>conductor. Mr. Potter, of his own motion, paid the
</p>
<p>money back on presentation of the receipts and gave
</p>
<p>the men passes home. He then told the members of
</p>
<p>the committee that they had exceeded their leave of
</p>
<p>absence and that they should not repeat this. The
</p>
<p>company wanted to know where their men were, and
</p>
<p>when they wanted to come again they must notifv
</p>
<p>their respective officers where they were going. Mr.
</p>
<p>Potter was asked to make some provisions, whereby
</p>
<p>the men could help railroad men over the road, who
</p>
<p>were out of work ; men whom they knew to belong to
</p>
<p>either of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, or
</p>
<p>Locomotive Firemen, but he said he could not do that
</p>
<p>until he had consulted with the general managers, Hol-
</p>
<p>dridge, of the Burlington & Missouri; and Merrill, of the
</p>
<p>Kansas City, St. Joseph & Council Bluffs railroad.
</p>
<p>All parties separated pleasantly, and the men thought
</p>
<p>they had accomplished very much, in getting what they
</p>
<p>supposed were rules under which the local officers
</p>
<p>would be governed. How 7 much we were disap-
</p>
<p>pointed will be seen in the following chapters.
</p>
<p>Securing recognition of the Brotherhood from the
</p>
<p>Burlington system, which always refused to recog-
</p>
<p>nize its labor as having any rights not voluntarily
</p>
<p>granted by the Burlington officials, was considered a
</p>
<p>victory. The Grand Chief, P. M. Arthur, in acknow r -
</p>
<p>ledging the receipt of a group picture of the griev-
</p>
<p>ance committee, wrote: "I prize the picture highly,

</p>
<p>The men all felt that to secure written laws, to in-
</p>
<p>sure just treatment  the first of its kind in existence
</p>
<p>on the Burlington  was a victory for just principles.
</p>
<p>" Unfortunately, injustice will always prevail this side
</p>
<p>of heaven, and it is the part of wise men to reduce
</p>
<p>that to the smallest amount possible, and the surest
</p>
<p>rule for its rapid diminution is, that each man should
</p>
<p>himself act justly toward all others. The unjust act
</p>
<p>of a corporation is made up of unjust acts of the mem-
</p>
<p>bers, or directors, or managers of that corporation,
</p>
<p>and it is absurd for any man to feel that he can use
</p>
<p>corporate power unjustly, and shirk off from the re-
</p>
<p>sponsibility of such a sin." ' Yet this is done with per-
</p>
<p>fect impunity; and officers are kept by corporations,
</p>
<p>who are known as aggressive violators of all laws not
</p>
<p>in the interest of the corporation they represent, and
</p>
<p>the Burlington was no exception.

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.
</p>
<p>THE NEW TREATY A ROPE OF SAND.
</p>
<p>The members of the committee returned to their
</p>
<p>respective divisions and met with the local officers,
</p>
<p>anxious to know whether the new laws were under-
</p>
<p>stood and how they were liked. The men were satis-
</p>
<p>fied and everything moved off pleasantly. The offi-
</p>
<p>cials however, smarting under the restraint of the new
</p>
<p>rules, and no doubt remembering the undignified position
</p>
<p>they had been placed in at the Chicago meeting, com-
</p>
<p>menced immediatelv devising means of evading the
</p>
<p>rules and construing them to the greatest disadvantage
</p>
<p>of the men. Before the month of April was out
</p>
<p>letters began to come to the chairman, Mr. Porter,
</p>
<p>entering complaints of the violation of article n. Mr.
</p>
<p>Wheatly, of Beardstown, wrote April 30, that "mas-
</p>
<p>ter mechanic Forsvth said if we arrive two hours or
</p>
<p>more late we get nothing for it, and that the men have
</p>
<p>to be held two hours or over after arrival in yard be-
</p>
<p>fore we get anvthing for it." ' Article 11 was under-
</p>
<p>stood to mean two hours over schedule time by both
</p>
<p>the committee and most of the officers. They thor-
</p>
<p>oughly discussed this item and the two clauses, viz:
</p>
<p>Two hours before starting, and the two hours or
</p>
<p>more waiting. This was contended for by the commit-
</p>
<p>tee to prevent loss of time by unnecessary delay. At
</p>
<p>Council Bluffs, the engineer was obliged to take his
</p>
<p>train from two to three hours before leaving time, and

</p>
<p>go to the union depot, a mile away, and wait there un-
</p>
<p>til leaving time, without pay. Other roads have a man
</p>
<p>to do that work, and the men wanted pay for it, or
</p>
<p>have some one else do the work. There was another
</p>
<p>reason for the needless loss of time; it was branch runs
</p>
<p>that went part way on the main line and then on the branch
</p>
<p>road, and the trains would often be held two or three
</p>
<p>hours waiting for orders, at the junction point; and
</p>
<p>they wished to effect a cure, as this delay was unneces-
</p>
<p>sary. The following letter from McCook will show
</p>
<p>what the men had to do for nothing before the adop-
</p>
<p>tion of this rule : " We wait in Denver, for Denver
</p>
<p>and Rio Grande trains, from one to eight hours. We
</p>
<p>have to take the train to the depot ready to leave on
</p>
<p>time. Now we put in the full delay, and the time-
</p>
<p>keeper deducts one hour. I waited six hours and for-
</p>
<p>ty-five minutes for No. 2, put in claim for seven, and got
</p>
<p>allowed six hours. There has been no complaint here
</p>
<p>and all seem satisfied.
</p>
<p>S. E. Hoge, of the committee.
</p>
<p>The officers of the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad
</p>
<p>so understood it, and on completing the arrangements,
</p>
<p>the time of an extra train was limited to the average
</p>
<p>of all freight trains on the division, and the engine crew
</p>
<p>was entitled to pay for all time over that schedule, less
</p>
<p>one hour, which was always given the company. But
</p>
<p>the Hannibal & St. Joseph and the McCook officials
</p>
<p>were exceptions, and if all had been like them, it is
</p>
<p>reasonable to suppose that the strike of 1888 would
</p>
<p>not have occured.

<p>It will be remembered that the committee made a

<p>84 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>request upon Vice-President Potter to arrange some
</p>
<p>plan whereby the men could render assistance to
</p>
<p>engineers out of work, by getting them passed over
</p>
<p>the road, and in answer to this request the following
</p>
<p>letter was received:
</p>
<p>Chicago, May 10, 1886.
</p>
<p>J. C. Porter, Esq., Engineer,
</p>
<p>Aurora, 111.,
</p>
<p>Dear Sir:
</p>
<p>I have taken considerable pains to talk with
</p>
<p>our managers and superintendent, and also the mana-
</p>
<p>gers of the Rock Island, North-Western, and Alton
</p>
<p>roads, with reference to passing engineers, and it is the
</p>
<p>unanimous opinion that we cannot adopt any whole-
</p>
<p>sale plan for passing one class of our employes unless
</p>
<p>we do the same for the others. What we aim to do is
</p>
<p>to treat everybody as near alike, and as fair as we pos-
</p>
<p>sibly can. My notion is, while I do not say that it will
</p>
<p>be carried out, if an engineer in good standing makes
</p>
<p>a request on his superintendent for passes for a brother
</p>
<p>engineer, the chances are that they will be granted.
</p>
<p>I am sorry to have delayed answering the committee
</p>
<p>so long, but I have been busy and have just been able
</p>
<p>to get reply from the Chicago & Alton, dated the 8th
</p>
<p>inst. Yours Truly,
</p>
<p>(Signed,) T. J. Potter.
</p>
<p>The hint contained in this letter was not complied
</p>
<p>with to any extent, and finally was denied altogether,
</p>
<p>and tfiey would not grant a pass unless it was request-

<p>ed by a superintendent, under whom the beneficiary
</p>
<p>THE NEW TREATY A ROPE OF SAND. 85
</p>
<p>worked : so that an engineer out of work could not be
</p>
<p>passed. These courtesies between engineers are shown
</p>
<p>on nearly all roads, and the Burlington men on many
</p>
<p>divisions, were soon retaliated upon and badlv scored
</p>
<p>by engineers employed on other roads, for this lack of
</p>
<p>courtesy ; they were glad, when away from home, to
</p>
<p>be courteously carried themselves, but could not return
</p>
<p>the compliment. It was not permitted.
</p>
<p>The officials, in order to understand how each one
</p>
<p>was doing in relation to this matter, held a meeting at
</p>
<p>Burlington. The superintendent of one of the divis-
</p>
<p>ions told me ' that at one of these meetings all the offi-
</p>
<p>cials said they were giving no passes for this purpose.
</p>
<p>But he ' did give some, and gave me one at that time,
</p>
<p>but very reluctantly. Another object of the meeting
</p>
<p>was to discuss the best means of defeating the intent
</p>
<p>and purpose of the recently enacted rules, and thev
</p>
<p>succeeded remarkably, both in that, and in creating a
</p>
<p>deep feeling of animosity between local officials and
</p>
<p>the men.
</p>
<p>On May 19, 1886, the second letter was received
</p>
<p>from Beardstown, stating that Mr. Forsyth, the master
</p>
<p>mechanic, claims that unless the men are held two
</p>
<p>hours on their engines after arriving at a terminal
</p>
<p>point, they are not entitled to any delayed time, and the
</p>
<p>chairman is requested to come to Beardstown and have
</p>
<p>him understand it as we all do. On the 25th of May
</p>
<p>another letter was received which said: "I was kept
</p>
<p>on the road three hours and twentv minutes more than
</p>
<p>schedule time and Mr. Forsvth savs I am not entitled
</p>
<p>to any delayed time. How is this? C. H. B.", It
</p>
<p>was understood at the meeting that if you were de-

</p>
<p>layed two or more hours in starting, the company got
</p>
<p>the first hour without pay, and the men were to be
</p>
<p>paid after the first hour. If the train left on time and
</p>
<p>arrived two or more hours late, the company got the
</p>
<p>first hour and the men were paid for the balance, the
</p>
<p>company always getting an hour's work for nothing.
</p>
<p>On May 29, the chairman, J. C. Porter, received the
</p>
<p>following letter from the superintendent of motive
</p>
<p>power :
</p>
<p>J. C. Porter:
</p>
<p>I have not yet sent you any understand-
</p>
<p>ing in regard to Article 11, which we talked over the
</p>
<p>other day. In discussing the matter with some of our
</p>
<p>master mechanics, I am not sure but that we may both
</p>
<p>be mistaken in regard to Mr. Stone's construction of
</p>
<p>this rule ; I therefore will get Mr. Besler's approval be-
</p>
<p>fore I submit you anything.
</p>
<p>G. W. Rhodes.
</p>
<p>After Mr. Rhodes obtained the manager's under-
</p>
<p>standing of Article 11, the following letter was written
</p>
<p>and sent to Chairman Porter, at Aurora, and A. For-
</p>
<p>syth, master mechanic at Beardstown, 111. :

<p>the pay of engineers and firemen. The easiest way to
</p>
<p>understand this rule is to interpret it as meaning just ex-
</p>
<p>actly what it says, i. e., in clause i, engineers delayed
</p>
<p>over two hours in starting from a terminal, will be paid
</p>
<p>for the full delay, less one hour. This is perf ectly plain .
</p>
<p>It does not say anything about what should be done in
</p>
<p>case a quick run was made afterwards, so that there
</p>
<p>was really no delay at all; the fact remains the same
</p>
<p>that there was a delay at starting, and therefore it is to
</p>
<p>be paid for. The same in regard to after arriving at
</p>
<p>a terminal. Supposing a train arrives six hours late at
</p>
<p>a terminal, and is taken care of. There is no delay in
</p>
<p>this case after arriving, and there will be no pay al-
</p>
<p>lowed for it. It does not matter whether a train ar-
</p>
<p>rives ahead of time or late ; if there is over two hours
</p>
<p>delay after arriving, engineers and firemen will be paid
</p>
<p>for the full delay, less one hour.
</p>
<p>The second paragraph needs no comment. The
</p>
<p>third paragraph is also plain in view of what has pre-
</p>
<p>ceded. Under this paragraph, delays are paid which
</p>
<p>produce delays arriving at terminals, or have any con-
</p>
<p>nection with those after arriving.

</p>
<p>It will be seen by this construction that no delays
</p>
<p>were paid for, unless they were held two hours or
</p>
<p>more in one place. It is no uncommon occurrence, for
</p>
<p>what is termed a local freight, to start out on time,
</p>
<p>when the business of the company would require thirty
</p>
<p>minutes to an hour and a half at each station, with

</p>
<p>eight or ten hours late, they get nothing for the over
</p>
<p>time. It should be remembered, in this discussion of
</p>
<p>pay, that the engineers  though they must hold them-
</p>
<p>selves in readiness at all times, to be called when
</p>
<p>wanted;  receive nothing only for actual work
</p>
<p>performed; you must not absent yourself without
</p>
<p>permission, though you may not be called for a week
</p>
<p>or a month, and you will get nothing for the month in
</p>
<p>which you waited. The number of engine men on the
</p>
<p>rolls of a company, makes no difference with the com-
</p>
<p>pany's expenses. To make this plain I here quote
</p>
<p>from the Burlington book of rules:
</p>
<p>rule 185.
</p>
<p>" Every person employed by the Company must de-
</p>
<p>vote himself exclusively to its service, and must not
</p>
<p>connect himself directly or indirectly with any other
</p>
<p>trade or business, without permission from the General
</p>
<p>Manager."
</p>
<p>rule 188.
</p>
<p>Every employe will be liable to suspension from
</p>
<p>duty, and dismissal for disobedience of orders, negli-
</p>
<p>gence, misconduct, or incompetency, and to immediate
</p>
<p>dismissal without cause assigned. The pay of every
</p>
<p>employe suspended from duty will be stopped during
</p>
<p>such suspension.

<p>sickness, immediate notice must be given' to his supe-
</p>
<p>rior officer. The pay of employes, absent on account of
</p>
<p>sickness, or with permission, will be stopped during
</p>
<p>the period of such absence, unless otherwise directed
</p>
<p>by competent authority.
</p>
<p>The report of labor statistics of Michigan, 1886,
</p>
<p>says: "Of 1858 men employed on twenty-four railroads,
</p>
<p>agents average $47.10 per month; brakemen $47.64;
</p>
<p>conductors $74.97; engineers $85; firemen $45; and
</p>
<p>laborers $32.52. After the trip is performed, which
</p>
<p>is paid for, the engineer is expected to go to the round-
</p>
<p>house, and thoroughly inspect and take care of his en-
</p>
<p>gine, wedges, and rods, and do packing etc. ; and the
</p>
<p>firemen has to go and clean his engine, which is no
</p>
<p>trifle, and this without remuneration. It is reasonable
</p>
<p>that when the company assigns men to duty, they ought
</p>
<p>to be willing to pay for what time is consumed in work
</p>
<p>ordered to be done."
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the management has the skill to
</p>
<p>keep men waiting for work, and if the business runs
</p>
<p>low, the loss is assessed more on labor, in proportion,
</p>
<p>than on capital. This need not be so, and it ought not
</p>
<p>to be; but it has to be so according to the Burlington
</p>
<p>system of economy. For example : In a time of dull
</p>
<p>business, a man will be out on a trip. He is paid for
</p>
<p>going, and when he comes back he will be paid for
</p>
<p>the return trip also. But he may be obliged to wait
</p>
<p>at the other end of the road three days, for a train to re-
</p>
<p>turn with, and all that time without pay and on expense,
</p>
<p>taking five days to make two, and all this time sub-
</p>
<p>ject to call and liable to dismissal if not found when

<p>wanted. Then again the men are sometimes worked
</p>
<p>beyond endurance, at so much per trip, which brings
</p>
<p>large salaries, and these are always quoted by the offi-
</p>
<p>cials, yet the average is not large.
</p>
<p>But the screws of capital were always tightened,
</p>
<p>never loosened, and the officials of the Burlington,
</p>
<p>seemingly forgetful of the obligation implied in the
</p>
<p>signature of Vice-President and General Manager, T.
</p>
<p>J. Potter, studied not to live up to the intent and pur-
</p>
<p>pose of the settlement, but entered into a strife
</p>
<p>among themselves to see who could outdo the other,
</p>
<p>in violating the most, and paying the least for delayed
</p>
<p>time, and most intercept other benefits to the men pro-
</p>
<p>vided for in the rules. Master Mechanic West, of
</p>
<p>Burlington, would not allow the delay unless it was
</p>
<p>over two hours, and would not take the engineer's
</p>
<p>statement, but would ask the station agent where the
</p>
<p>delay occurred. The conductor, after the train is
</p>
<p>stopped, usually does what work there is to be done
</p>
<p>first, before he goes to the office, perhaps fifteen or
</p>
<p>twenty minutes after arrival. He then goes to the
</p>
<p>office, and failing to get orders to proceed, waits one
</p>
<p>hour and fifty minutes, making two hours and ten
</p>
<p>minutes. But Mr. West would not allow it, because
</p>
<p>the conductor's report did not show it, doing both an
</p>
<p>injustice in not allowing the time, according to the con-
</p>
<p>struction of the rule, and casting a reflection upon the
</p>
<p>honesty of the engineer.

<p>minutes. He then received orders to run to Stone Ave-
</p>
<p>nue, and there he waited for orders one hour and fifty
</p>
<p>minutes, and then he was ordered to run to Riverside,
</p>
<p>where the wreck occurred, and waited there for the track
</p>
<p>to be cleared one hour and ten minutes, making four
</p>
<p>hours and fifteen minutes delay. Mr. Minot made the
</p>
<p>claim for this time which was returned to him as not
</p>
<p>allowed. On meeting Mr. Johnson, the master me-
</p>
<p>chanic, he said: "We were a little too smart for you,
</p>
<p>weren't we? We have instructed the dispatchers so
</p>
<p>that there will be no delayed time." Mr. N. J. Para-
</p>
<p>dise, master mechanic of the Hannibal & St. Joseph R.
</p>
<p>R. was present and Mr. Minot stated the case to him,
</p>
<p>and he said : "Yes, you are surely entitled to all the time,
</p>
<p>less one hour." Mr. Johnson did not agree with Mr.
</p>
<p>Paradise and said, "It would not be allowed, and did
</p>
<p>not want any more such reports put in." This is the
</p>
<p>same Mr. Johnson who served on the grievance commit-
</p>
<p>tee in 1873, as a member of the Brotherhood of Loco-
</p>
<p>motive Engineers, and is said to have stated to Mr.
</p>
<p>Harris he would never trouble him again with any
</p>
<p>grievance.
</p>
<p>There is a long yard at Creston, Iowa, and to defeat
</p>
<p>the object of the delayed time rule, the officers cut the
</p>
<p>yard in two, making it East and West Creston, and if
</p>
<p>the yard was blocked so the enginemen could not get
</p>
<p>out of the yard, or get their engines to the roundhouse,
</p>
<p>the officials would move them from one end of the
</p>
<p>yard to the other, and then claim they were not entitled
</p>
<p>to delayed time because they were not in one place
</p>
<p>two hours or more. It was not so much the money

<p>ing to a railroad man as delays, and they wanted them
</p>
<p>cured. How were these things to be met ? To denounce
</p>
<p>them would not alter their condition. Denunciations nev-

<p>er accomplish much, and in the present case the v would
</p>
<p>amount to nothing. Each officer falls back behind his

<p>superior, when cornered, and says "It is not I," and no
</p>
<p>one individual can find the responsible part}'. A un-
</p>
<p>ion of action became necessary. A power that dared
</p>
<p>to measure swords, even with a railroad corporation,
</p>
<p>was a necessity. The laws violated as they were did not

<p>effect any cure and the officials' conduct incensed

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIX.
</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION.
</p>
<p>The animosity against the Burlington management
</p>
<p>was not confined to the Burlington employes entirely.
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that this road was classified by the
</p>
<p>order of Oct. 10, 1876,' and the gates of employment
</p>
<p>were, from that time on, gradually closed until 1886.
</p>
<p>No engineers were hired if it could possibly be helped.
</p>
<p>Six thousand miles of road were locked against all
</p>
<p>comers seeking that kind of work, and the firemen's
</p>
<p>places held for these men only who were of age, and
</p>
<p>not over 26. The Burlington was not alone in work-
</p>
<p>ing into this channel of creating a supply and dimin-
</p>
<p>ishing the demand. The enginemen throughout the
</p>
<p>continent saw in this classification the formation of a
</p>
<p>trust, or combine, that forshadowed a future which
</p>
<p>had in it the learning of a new business, or no occupa-
</p>
<p>tion and poverty.
</p>
<p>The Burlington is the best illustration of the evils of
</p>
<p>the classification system, which is practiced more
</p>
<p>or less throughout the country, it being the long-
</p>
<p>est line with its doors absolutely closed to apply-
</p>
<p>ing engineers. Such an immense road, traversing the
</p>
<p>states of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska,
</p>
<p>and Colorado, and still stretching its lono; arms out to
</p>
<p>grasp more territory; and along the whole vast dis-
</p>
<p>tance, " No engineer need apply ! "

<p>as wipers in roundhouses, and helpers, and are event-
</p>
<p>ually put to firing a switch engine, at $1.40 per day,
</p>
<p>then to work on a road engine as third-class firemen
</p>
<p>at $1.65. When they have worked a year at this, their
</p>
<p>pay is advanced to $1.85 per day. Some of the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington officials made the year to include 365 days of
</p>
<p>actual work, if it took a year and a half to do it.
</p>
<p>When they have worked out the second year they
</p>
<p>are advanced to $2.10 per day, full first-class pay.
</p>
<p>They will average at least two years at this, and then,
</p>
<p>if found qualified, are promoted to be third-class engi-
</p>
<p>neers on switch engines, at $2.25 per day. If kept on
</p>
<p>switch engine second year, $2.50; third year, $2.75 ; on
</p>
<p>road engine, first year, $2.50; second year, $3.05; third
</p>
<p>year, $3.60; requiring from seven to nine years to be-
</p>
<p>come first-class engineers. They are held to a strict
</p>
<p>account for any violation of rules, the rules to be
</p>
<p>defined by the superintendent, master mechanic, fore-
</p>
<p>man or train dispatcher. Any one of these can, by
</p>
<p>complaint, exercise an influence that would make
</p>
<p>holding one's position almost impossible.
</p>
<p>None are infallible, and the best of men are liable to
</p>
<p>be discharged. If you should be so unfortunate as to
</p>
<p>have to seek work elsewhere, you start out, not for
</p>
<p>the Burlington, for they do not hire any. You will make
</p>
<p>application at many places, where } r ou will receive
</p>
<p>the same answer: "We do not hire any men; we make
</p>
<p>them." If you should meet a master mechanic who
</p>
<p>does want a man, you will probably be confronted with
</p>
<p>a blank form of application which you are to fill out

<p>and return to him for inspection, of which the follow-

<p>Burlington, if you worked for the Burlington last. If
</p>
<p>you go to the Northern Pacific, with its great stretch of

<p>roads, you must meet the same obstacles. On these
</p>
<p>three systems, owning not less than eighteen thousand
</p>
<p>miles, the engineer who is unfortunate enough to have
</p>
<p>been discharged, must submit his future and that of
</p>
<p>his family, to the good will, or the ill will of one man,

<p>viz: the officer who discharged him. If the officer to
</p>
<p>whom you apply persists in saying " No," what are you

</p>
<p>are in a sad condition when the officials of a corpora-

<p>When these 45,000 people undertake to cure this

<p>injustice, all the Pinkerton detectives, deputy sheriffs

<p>them, as violators of the law. If the rights of labor were

<p>of capital, the oppressions of corporations could not ex-
</p>
<p>ist. The engineer expects to be rigidly examined and
</p>
<p>give references, but when his recommendation must
</p>
<p>come from one who has discharged him, his chances
</p>
<p>are decidedly poor. What object can these companies
</p>
<p>have in entering into such an agreement between each
</p>
<p>other, to so abridge individual liberty ? What do they
</p>
<p>want with this personal record ? This death warrant,
</p>
<p>the men call it. It would do credit to the genius of a
</p>
<p>detective agency. It makes every honest laboring
</p>
<p>man who fills one out, feel as though there was some-
</p>
<p>thing degrading in it, and as though he was to be
</p>
<p>watched like a criminal. I can see but two reasons

<p>the most potent is, desire for cheap labor; the other is to
</p>
<p>p8 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>keep a supply in excess of the demand. When they
</p>
<p>cease hiring, they do not cease discharging, and the
</p>
<p>natural consequence is an excess of idle engineers.
</p>
<p>The companies assert that when they promote a
</p>
<p>man to be an engineer, they are taking a risk, that
</p>
<p>the man's ability has not been tested. This principle
</p>
<p>must be conceded as right, and the engineers have al-
</p>
<p>ways been willing to allow this test for six months or
</p>
<p>one year at reduced pay. The men promoted have
</p>
<p>been on an engine an average of four years before
</p>
<p>they are tried with full responsibility. In other trades
</p>
<p>a term of three years is considered time enough for the
</p>
<p>average man to learn a trade, but the company want
</p>
<p>him to work seven years. It will be remembered that
</p>
<p>the 1876 committee requested the company to annul
</p>
<p>classification and return to apprenticeship, which paid
</p>
<p>$3 for first year and then full pay. 1 Mr. Potter was
</p>
<p>asked, " If you are obliged to assume a risk in pro-
</p>
<p>moting a new man, why is it you will not hire a man
</p>
<p>of undoubted ability and unquestionable reference?''
</p>
<p>Mr. Potter replied : " We have found we had bet-
</p>
<p>ter luck in making engineers than in hiring them."
</p>
<p>He also denied any knowledge of any intended effort
</p>
<p>to interfere with the engineer's future. But this is
</p>
<p>hardly plausible. Local officials are usually allowed
</p>
<p>some privileges in selecting their employes, and if there
</p>
<p>was not a set principle involved, why should they be
</p>
<p>denied the privilege of hiring their best friend in this
</p>
<p>department ? Why do they not practice the same rule
</p>
<p>with conductors ?
</p>
<p>It is evident there is an antagonism existing against
</p>
<p>the engineers' organization because it has power to

<p>CLASSIFICATION.

</p>
<p>demand fixed and equitable conditions. In the classi-
</p>
<p>fication system there are two motives  one to secure
</p>
<p>cheap engineers and firemen through the long years of
</p>
<p>preparatory work; the other to create a surplus of men
</p>
<p>by not hiring, so that these unemployed men could be used
</p>
<p>to break down that power. It became the definite ob-
</p>
<p>ject of the engineers throughout the country to change
</p>
<p>this odious classification system, and at the convention
</p>
<p>held in October, at New York City, laws were enacted
</p>
<p>to govern their future action in trying to do away with
</p>
<p>this evil. The grand chief, P. M. Arthur, when
</p>
<p>asked his opinion, said : " Apprenticeship is a right prin-
</p>
<p>ciple, but when a law is so badly abused as this, I
</p>
<p>know of no way only to do away with it." Engineers
</p>
<p>have traveled thousands of miles, and wasted the sav-
</p>
<p>ings of years hunting work, and at each place would
</p>
<p>hear the same old story, " I make all my engineers."
</p>
<p>The reader can better imagine than I can describe,
</p>
<p>the feelings of a man who has spent twelve or fifteen
</p>
<p>years of the best part of his life in learning a business,
</p>
<p> with family responsibilities upon him, too old to
</p>
<p>begin learning a new business, unable to support his
</p>
<p>family while he tried, and not allowed to work even
</p>
<p>as fireman, if past the age of twenty-six; his whole fu-
</p>
<p>ture blasted by the system of classification.
</p>
<p>As theBurlington has had the reputation of having
</p>
<p>the most unyielding and illiberal management in the
</p>
<p>country, and being the leader in the aggressive work
</p>
<p>against organized labor, it naturally called forth like op-
</p>
<p>position from its men, and the strike of 1888 was not in
</p>
<p>its true sense, a local strike. The Brotherhood, from

</p>
<p>necessary to put a stop to further encroachments upon
</p>
<p>their individual and collective interests.
</p>
<p>In the year 1877, the Philadelphia & Reading rail-
</p>
<p>road issued a circular letter to their engineers, de-
</p>
<p>manding their withdrawal from the Brotherhood, and
</p>
<p>the engineers on that road replied : " We would do
</p>
<p>violence and dishonor to an intelligent manhood, were
</p>
<p>we to accept any thing less than the withdrawal of
</p>
<p>said circular." The company failing to withdraw it,
</p>
<p>the men stopped work in a body.
</p>
<p>On the 30th of July, 1888, eleven years after, Jacob
</p>
<p>G. Freas went to the Reading officials and obtained a
</p>
<p>letter recommending both his ability and character,
</p>
<p>but containing this : " He was in the strike on our
</p>
<p>lines in '77." He had, like his forefathers, rebelled
</p>
<p>against encroachments upon his individual liberties.
</p>
<p>He traveled the country over, but found none who
</p>
<p>would employ him because the Reading officials had
</p>
<p>implied their objections. His manhood was preserved ;
</p>
<p>his reward for its preservation  poverty; because of

<p>CONSERVATISM.
</p>
<p>The conduct of the engineers had been extremely
</p>
<p>conservative. They had worked f aithf ully forty days,
</p>
<p>and spent $2,906 in an effort to secure these laws;
</p>
<p>had waited patiently for fifteen days for Mr. Potter to
</p>
<p>go over the system and rind out that 95 per cent of
</p>
<p>the men belonged to the Brotherhood. They were
</p>
<p>conservative both in their actions and teachings. A
</p>
<p>union meeting was held at Kansas City, on July n.
</p>
<p>The Kansas City "Journal, a leading daily paper which
</p>
<p>had fought and defeated the Typographical Union,
</p>
<p>and was considered an enemy to organized labor,
</p>
<p>printed the address and commented as follows:
</p>
<p>chief Arthur's address.
</p>
<p>" This morning we publish in full the address of Mr.
</p>
<p>P. M. Arthur, chief of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
</p>
<p>Engineers of North America, delivered at the Coates
</p>
<p>opera house yesterday afternoon."
</p>
<p>" We thought the address would be good, and we
</p>
<p>are not disappointed. We have no hesitation in saying
</p>
<p>that we have never seen a clearer and more dignified
</p>
<p>statement of the relations of labor to capital than is
</p>
<p>contained in this address. It is an honest, manly state-
</p>
<p>ment, in which the rights of honorable labor are as-
</p>
<p>serted and the obligations of capital to labor, and labor

</p>
<p>to capital, fairly and honorably defined."
</p>
<p>102 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>" If the doctrines taught by Chief Arthur are ob-
</p>
<p>served by the organization he represents, the standard
</p>
<p>of railroad management, in its relations to its engineers,
</p>
<p>will soon be lifted above the low plane of suspicion and
</p>
<p>contention, and in one respect at least the equitable re-
</p>
<p>lations of capital and labor will be maintained. With
</p>
<p>the inauguration of the sound sentiments expressed by
</p>
<p>Air. Arthur, we can justly commend organized labor.''
</p>
<p>" The essence of the whole question lies in the ad-
</p>
<p>mirable motto taken by the Order of Locomotive En-
</p>
<p>gineers at its organization: "Sobriety, truth, justice
</p>
<p>and morality, " for their rule : " Do unto others as you
</p>
<p>would have others do unto you, and so fulfill the law."
</p>
<p>These are indeed rules for action which are calculated
</p>
<p>to soften asperities in the relations of man to man."
</p>
<p>"Standing for the principles of justice and right,
</p>
<p>offering equity for equity, asking forbearance and
</p>
<p>granting forbearance, demanding facts and presenting
</p>
<p>facts; these are the forces which, backed by intelli-
</p>
<p>gence, public opinion and justifiable firmness, will win
</p>
<p>victories for labor and compel concessions from capi-
</p>
<p>tal."
</p>
<p>"Following an insane attempt to cripple capital, to
</p>
<p>defy law and harass society, this calm enunciation of a
</p>
<p>safer and better doctrine is indeed encouraging."
</p>
<p>"  He must be a man of good moral character, tem-
</p>
<p>perate habits, be able to read and write, and have one
</p>
<p>year's experience as a locomotive engineer. And
</p>
<p>then he must behave himself after he gets in, or we
</p>
<p>will put him out.'"

<p>this body of organized laborers. There is no oath that
</p>
<p>CONSERVATISM. IO3
</p>
<p>conflicts with the laws of state or nation. There is no
</p>
<p>obligation that forces enmity of man to man. No rules
</p>
<p>for the starvation of fellowmen."
</p>
<p>"No wiser words were ever uttered in the labor
</p>
<p>world than the following: "
</p>
<p>" ' We claim the right, after exhausting every honor-
</p>
<p>able effort, to effect a settlement. If they ignore us,
</p>
<p>and will not grant us a hearing, we claim the right to
</p>
<p>quit if we want to quit, and do quit in a body. But
</p>
<p>having quit, my friends, we do not claim the right to
</p>
<p>take another man by the throat and say: "Thou shalt
</p>
<p>not " or, " Thou shalt." That's the great difficulty and
</p>
<p>the great mistake with labor organizations, and I care
</p>
<p>not by what name they go. When you attempt to use
</p>
<p>force and intimidation; when you attempt by force to
</p>
<p>prevent another man from earning a livelihood for him-
</p>
<p>self and family, you violate every law of equity and
</p>
<p>justice, and should be punished.' "
</p>
<p>" No labor organization can live that does not recog-
</p>
<p>nize and sustain these plain demands of justice and free-
</p>
<p>dom."
</p>
<p>"We cannot at this time allude to the many admir-
</p>
<p>able points in this labor organization as detailed by
</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur, but we commend the address to the labor-
</p>
<p>er and capitalist alike."
</p>
<p>When enemies of organized labor find nothing to
</p>
<p>condemn and much to commend in the Brotherhood,
</p>
<p>it has a right to assume that its principles are just and
</p>
<p>equitable. It is beyond question that a great majority
</p>
<p>of the members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive En-
</p>
<p>gineers are in heartv accord with the principles enun-

<p>ciated by Grand Chief Arthur, and are obedient to the
</p>
<p>104 THE BURLINGTON STRIDE.
</p>
<p>rules of their institution. That there will be found
</p>
<p>some unworthy and irresponsible men in every institu-
</p>
<p>tion is to be expected. But that the enginemen have
</p>
<p>been extremely free from such characters is evidenced
</p>
<p>by the diversity of commendation from men of high
</p>
<p>standing, both in and out of the railroad service. We
</p>
<p>add this, first because we think the enginemen deserve
</p>
<p>credit for conservative action ; and further it is meant
</p>
<p>as a timely caution to men of labor organizations not to
</p>
<p>be moved by the treachery of bad men from within,
</p>
<p>nor by the craft of enemies from without.
</p>
<p>These are broad principles, and indicate strongly a
</p>
<p>disposition to meet on common ground, and to deal
</p>
<p>out justice while demanding it. The convention at
</p>
<p>Chicago modified the classification law, so that the
</p>
<p>changes in this direction should be voted upon, and the
</p>
<p>committee was to be governed by the voice of all the
</p>
<p>men they represented. The Brotherhood has been
</p>
<p>accused of being a one-man power, but a little light
</p>
<p>upon their principles is convincing that each member
</p>
<p>is a free moral agent outside of the well-defined rules
</p>
<p>for his moral conduct. It is true everywhere, that
</p>
<p>when men have reached positions of responsibility and
</p>
<p>of influence, by their own individual merit, and have
</p>
<p>conducted themselves consistentlv with their rank and
</p>
<p>station, that they acquire a powerful personal influence.
</p>
<p>This was eminently true of George Washington and
</p>
<p>of Abraham Lincoln, and, in the measure of ability
</p>
<p>and of opportunity, it is true in every variety of life.
</p>
<p>It is the very essence of the Brotherhood organization
</p>
<p>to guard with jealous care the members' individual

<p>strength, while these principles prevail.
</p>
<p>In October, 1886, at the New York convention,
</p>
<p>Chauncey M. Depew, president of the New York
</p>
<p>Central railroad, among other things said : " Your or-
</p>
<p>ganization arose when I first went into railroad work,
</p>
<p>twent}' r -three years ago, and I have watched it care-
</p>
<p>fully ever since, and one thing that impresses me
</p>
<p>forcibly is the change in the character of your mem-
</p>
<p>bers that has taken place. The old method called for
</p>
<p>blasphemy without stint from the engineers as a nec-
</p>
<p>essary accompaniment of every duty, no matter how
</p>
<p>trifling. That type of engineer is now either dead or
</p>
<p>converted. The proper thing to brace up the nerves
</p>
<p>for a trip was whiskey, and plenty of it. Now, your
</p>
<p>Order prohibits spirituous liquors, and if one of your
</p>
<p>members is discharged for drunkenness, no committee
</p>
<p>of yours asks for his reinstatement."
</p>
<p>Gov. Leon Abbott, of New Jersey, in an address at
</p>
<p>the same time and place said : " You do not rush into
</p>
<p>unnecessary strikes if a corporation will show some
</p>
<p>disposition to listen to your grievances. You believe
</p>
<p>in arbitration, and that there are two sides to every
</p>
<p>question, and that both employe and employer should
</p>
<p>be heard in every instance. I read the four mottoes of
</p>
<p>your organization: "Sobriety and truth, justice and
</p>
<p>morality; defense, not defiance," 1 and I say that so
</p>
<p>long as you are guided by these mottos, so long will

<p>your order receive, as it does to-day, the approval and
</p>
<p>hospitality of this mighty city."

<p>MEETING OF GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE.
</p>
<p>The General Grievance Committee was called togeth-
</p>
<p>er at Aurora, Feb. 14, 1887. On assembling it was
</p>
<p>found that nearly all the committeemen were in an ag-
</p>
<p>gressive mood. Many of the officers on the various
</p>
<p>divisions of the system instead of being just and equita-
</p>
<p>ble, having stooped to absolute meanness, in order to
</p>
<p>give vent to their spleen and at the same time put
</p>
<p>more money into the treasury of the company, and so
</p>
<p>curry favor with it for themselves. The committee
</p>
<p>after some deliberation, sent its chairman, Mr. Porter,
</p>
<p>and secretary, J. A. Cuykendall, to Chicago, to wait on
</p>
<p>Mr. Potter, and see if he would not do something to
</p>
<p>compel the local officers to live up to the contract as
</p>
<p>made. The committee then adjourned to meet at
</p>
<p>Creston and receive the report. The committee an-
</p>
<p>ticipated much from this interview, because Mr. Potter
</p>
<p>told them when the settlement was made that " The
</p>
<p>officer who conducts himself in such a manner as to
</p>
<p>bring the grievance committee to him again, must be
</p>
<p>ready with good reasons."
</p>
<p>The chairman presented to Mr. Potter the numer-
</p>
<p>ours branches of the agreement, and the assumption
</p>
<p>of authority, to make changes, and exercise a prerog-
</p>
<p>ative the laws were specially made to cure. He

<p>J. C. Porter, Esq., Engineer,

<p>Aurora, 111.
</p>
<p>Dear Sir:
</p>
<p>I hand you herewith copy of letter that I
</p>
<p>have written all our general managers, in regard to the
</p>
<p>construction of rule No. 2.
</p>
<p>I have also called their attention to the complaints
</p>
<p>that have been made of the violation of the agreement
</p>
<p>entered into last April, and said to them all that the

<p>agreement made at that time must be adhered to by
</p>
<p>all. Yours Truly,

</p>
<p>Chicago, March 1, 1887.
</p>
<p>Dear Sir:
</p>
<p>I have had some talk with a committee of en-
</p>
<p>gineers with reference to the way rule 2 has been inter-
</p>
<p>preted. I want it construed from March 1, 1887, to
</p>
<p>mean, that if an engineer is delayed two hours or more
</p>
<p>that he will be paid for the full delay less one hour, that
</p>
<p>is to say, if he is delayed two hours he will be paid for
</p>
<p>one hour at the rates prescribed by article 2.
</p>
<p>Yours Truly,
</p>
<p>(Signed) T. J. Potter.
</p>
<p>Mr. Potter was contemplating leaving the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton for the Union Pacific, and did not give it the at-
</p>
<p>tention he undoubtedly would, had he intended to stay.

<p>The Creston yard difficulty remained until in May, 1887,

<p>superiors in office, and the chairman went to Mr. Bes-
</p>
<p>ler, general superintendent of the Burlington, and he
</p>
<p>ordered the two yards to be put back into one-
</p>
<p>When we consider that these officers had no financial
</p>
<p>interest involved, other than their salary, and that they
</p>
<p>were themselves employes, it is a queer commentary
</p>
<p>upon human kindness and the integrity of man, to re-
</p>
<p>cord such violations of both these qualities.
</p>
<p>General Manager Potter was a self-made man, com-
</p>
<p>ing from the foot of the ladder. He was not in the least
</p>
<p>austere or position-proud in his deportment. With a
</p>
<p>remarkable memory for names and faces, and with un-
</p>
<p>usual readiness saying something pleasant to
</p>
<p>every one, he was esteemed by all classes. It-is
</p>
<p>reasonable to believe that if left to his own inclination,
</p>
<p>he would have done more to protect the laborer from
</p>
<p>the evil conditions imposed by local officers. Wheth-
</p>
<p>er the order to discharge Chairman Fisher and Com-
</p>

<p>from Mr. Potter, or from the president of the company

<p>Burlington & Missouri division, undertook to prevent
</p>
<p>the organization of a brakeman's lodge, and to accom-

<p>plish it, he commenced the wholesale discharge of the
</p>
<p>men. Mr. Wilkinson, Grand Master of the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood of Railroad Brakemen, went to Mr. Potter and
</p>
<p>asked his intercession, which Mr. Potter readily re-
</p>
<p>sponded to, and gave Mr. Thompson to understand
</p>
<p>that he must stop such petty tyrany, and not discrimi-
</p>
<p>nate against Brotherhood men. After that time they

</p>
<p>were not annoyed by him, but a part of the settlement
</p>
<p>was that there should not be anything said about it.
</p>
<p>This does not look as though he was at all times man-
</p>
<p>aging in accordance with his own inclinations. Yet
</p>
<p>it is highly commendable in Mr. Potter, as it shows
</p>
<p>the right disposition. But it contains proof that he
</p>
<p>was not, in all things, a free agent in the management
</p>
<p>of the Burlington, but was controlled in his administra-
</p>
<p>tion by the men of the Boston idea  that labor has no
</p>
<p>rights not granted by the free will of the employer.
</p>
<p>I have been told that in a social conversation, Mr.
</p>
<p>Potter said the Burlington stockholders were dissatis-
</p>
<p>fied with his action in signing a contract and recog-
</p>
<p>nizing the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in
</p>
<p>1886, and his position had become unpleasant in con-
</p>
<p>sequence, and that the Burlington was seeing its best
</p>
<p>days. He evidently knew the relentless disposition of
</p>
<p>some one in authority, and knowing it, could see the
</p>
<p>inevitable result. Mr. Potter appreciated the employes
</p>
<p>as they did him, and on May 10, 1887, he wrote a letter
</p>
<p>to J. C. Porter, chairman of the grievance committee
</p>
<p>representing the enginemen. I do not think I betray
</p>
<p>any confidence now, since Mr. Potter's death, to give
</p>
<p>it to the public. It was only intended for the eye of
</p>
<p>the engineers and firemen when written. The letter is
</p>
<p>as follows:
</p>
<p>Chicago, Mav 10, 1887.

</p>
<p>up some questions of difference between the engineers
</p>
<p>and firemen on the one side, and the railroad company
</p>
<p>on the other. My reason for addressing you this let-
</p>
<p>ter, is on account of my leaving the service of the C,
</p>
<p>B. & Q road at an early day. I desire to express
</p>
<p>through you, my thanks to all the engineers and fire-
</p>
<p>men on the C, B. & Q. and its system of roads, for
</p>
<p>their honest co-operation in carrying out all the agree-
</p>
<p>ments made at that time. I wish further to say that
</p>
<p>it is with regret that I part company with so many good
</p>
<p>men as there are on the C, B. & Q. and its system
</p>
<p>of roads. I want you and the engineers and firemen
</p>
<p>on the C, B. & Q.and its system to know that I had a
</p>
<p>good opinion of their ability and integrity, and of the
</p>
<p>interest they have taken in the company's service.
</p>
<p>Very Truly Yours,
</p>
<p>(Signed) T. J. Potter.
</p>
<p>Mr. Potter carried with him the regrets of the em-
</p>
<p>ployes of all ranks. He was rightly disposed and was
</p>
<p>too sagacious a manager to allow a strike if it could be
</p>
<p>avoided, although he defended the capitalists he repre-
</p>
<p>sented, and contested for every inch of ground occu-
</p>
<p>pied. The committee of 1886 had listened to Mr. H.
</p>
<p>B. Stone's cold, deliberate, calculating debates on sup-
</p>
<p>ply and demand, saying, "If I wanted boiler iron I
</p>
<p>would go out on the market and buy it where I could
</p>
<p>get it the cheapest, and if I wanted to employ men I
</p>
<p>would do the same." With Mr. Potter gone, the em-
</p>
<p>ployes realized that all liberality went with him. There
</p>
<p>was one honorary member of the Brotherhood as mas-

<p>ter mechanic at Brookfield, but he left about the time

</p>
<p>Mr. Potter did, and the ground was clear of official
</p>
<p>good feeling between the enginemen and the mechan-
</p>
<p>ical department. The master mechanics were out-
</p>
<p>ranked by the division superindents so that the em-
</p>
<p>ployes were subject to conditions imposed by both ;
</p>
<p>neither being very friendly because the Brotherhood had
</p>
<p>made an effort to compel them to obey the rule, " Do
</p>
<p>unto others as you would they should do unto you."
</p>
<p>At the time of the strike of the Knights of Labor on
</p>
<p>the Gould system, a notice was put up by the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton Company, notifying all members of the Knights

<p>of Labor who were in their employ, to go to the
</p>
<p>heads of their respective departments and get their
</p>
<p>time checks, or withdraw from the Knights of Labor,
</p>
<p>and a great many complied with this in order to hold

<p>their places. With Mr. Potter gone, there did not

<p>seem to be any room for organized labor.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXII.
</p>
<p>COMMITTEE AT CRESTON. ENGINEERS AT CHICAGO.
</p>
<p>On the receipt of Mr. Potter's letter the committee
</p>
<p>was convened at Creston to hear the report of the
</p>
<p>chairman and secretary, and it was disappointing to
</p>
<p>them. They had expected Mr. Potter would define
</p>
<p>more fully the official duties of the local officers and
</p>
<p>make a special effort to define conditions that would
</p>
<p>insure peace. A copy of Mr. Potter's letter was sent
</p>
<p>to the Grand Chief, P. M. Arthur, which was an-
</p>
<p>swered in the following letter :
</p>
<p>Cleveland, March 9, 1887.
</p>
<p>Brothers Porter and Cuykendall :
</p>
<p>Your letter of the 2nd is at hand and con-
</p>
<p>tents carefully perused. Article 11 is before me and
</p>
<p>have just read it. The clause Mr. Potter bases his
</p>
<p>order on conflicts with the first clause, but I do not
</p>
<p>think it would be advisable to make an issue with
</p>
<p>him on it as we cannot make an agreement that
</p>
<p>includes classification, and it would be folly to at-
</p>
<p>tempt to abolish this without the co-operation of the
</p>
<p>roads centering in Chicago. I was in hopes that the
</p>
<p>brothers on these roads would unite on some plan to
</p>
<p>abolish classification. Until they do I would advise
</p>
<p>the brothers to accept Mr. Potter's offer. Give it a
</p>
<p>fair trial, and if it does not work satisfactorily the

</p>
<p>chairman can again call on Mr. Potter and explain
</p>
<p>114 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>the injustice of the article. He will doubtless modify
</p>
<p>it, as I believe he is inclined to be just. The law rela-
</p>
<p>tive to classification is working detrimentally to the
</p>
<p>best interests of our Order. It virtually ties the hands
</p>
<p>of the committee, and the grand chief. We have had
</p>
<p>two cases where the company offered to abolish all but
</p>
<p>one year, reducing from four classes to one, and we
</p>
<p>could not accept it, in consequence of the law. The
</p>
<p>law is too autocratic, and the brothers are beginning to
</p>
<p>realize it. Now, my brothers, you understand the
</p>
<p>situation; do what you think is for the best interest of
</p>
<p>all concerned.
</p>
<p>Fraternally Yours,
</p>
<p>P. M. Arthur, G. C. E.
</p>
<p>The committee was not pleased with the situation,
</p>
<p>but the majority were conservative, desiring peace,
</p>
<p>and were willing to follow the advice of Mr. Arthur,
</p>
<p>and wait and see what the result of Mr. Potter's letter
</p>
<p>would be. The firemen were also dissatisfied, and had
</p>
<p>just organized what is called the adjusting committee,
</p>
<p>which is governed by similar rules, and has the
</p>
<p>same objects as the grievance committee of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. The engi-
</p>
<p>neers' committee met with the chairman and sec-
</p>
<p>retary of the firemen's committee, and arranged
</p>
<p>that that committee's work should be suspended until
</p>
<p>after the engineers' convention, which was to be held
</p>
<p>in Chicago in October, 1887, when they expected a
</p>
<p>modification of the law on classification, and if they
</p>
<p>then felt the necessity of waiting upon the officials,

</p>
<p>they would go in a body, engineers and firemen, and
</p>
<p>COMMITTEE AT CRESTON. ENGIN EERS AT CHICAGO. 1 1 5
</p>
<p>make a united effort to cure the evils that were com-
</p>
<p>plained of by both orders. Had they followed out
</p>
<p>this plan, and met the Burlington officials immediately
</p>
<p>after the convention, as was then understood, it would
</p>
<p>have brought the meeting about Dec 2, in the face of
</p>
<p>one of our coldest winters, and success must have at-
</p>
<p>tended them. But they let the golden opportunity
</p>
<p>pass. After a protracted discussion of the situation,
</p>
<p>classification receiving the greatest attention, the com-
</p>
<p>mittee adjourned, and this ended the committee work
</p>
<p>until 1887. Votes were taken on the various roads
</p>
<p>centering in Chicago, and all voted, almost unanimous-
</p>
<p>ly, that it was such a menace to their future that it
</p>
<p>should be done away with, or something done to miti-
</p>
<p>gate its evils.
</p>
<p>The engineers' convention met in Chicago in Octo-
</p>
<p>ber, and at the opening an address was delivered by
</p>
<p>E. T. Jeffery, General Manager of the Illinois Central
</p>
<p>Railroad. Mr. Jeffery is a self-made man, coming
</p>
<p>up by force of character from the foot of the ladder to
</p>
<p>be general manager of one of the strongest and best man-
</p>
<p>aged corporations in this country. He has a thorough
</p>
<p>knowledge of railroad life, and possesses the confidence
</p>
<p>of all who serve under him. He sketched the rela-
</p>
<p>tions of officers and of engineers, to each other and to
</p>
<p>the company, and in turn the relations of the company
</p>
<p>to them. The following is the address as given in
</p>
<p>Central Music Hall, Chicago, October 19, 1887.
</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, Brotherhood and Friends: "We
</p>
<p>are assembled here as co-laborers, with a common

</p>
<p>interest and a common object in view. We have a
</p>
<p>Il6 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>like purpose and a like aim in life. Our responsibili-
</p>
<p>ties, duties and anxieties are identical in kind, and dif-
</p>
<p>fer only in degree. We stand before our employers
</p>
<p>charged with a great trust, and before the public with
</p>
<p>the gravest duties ever committed to human hands.
</p>
<p>The lives of the public and the property of our employ-
</p>
<p>ers are committed to our care. The first is a trust of
</p>
<p>pre-eminent character and importance. How can we
</p>
<p>fit ourselves to perform these duties, execute these
</p>
<p>trusts, carry these responsibilities, and satisfy in full
</p>
<p>the public and corporate claims upon us ? "
</p>
<p>" The first great requisite is the high standard of
</p>
<p>manhood which your organization has set itself to mold
</p>
<p>and establish. Without this all else is futile. With-
</p>
<p>out manly dignities and manly virtues we lose the
</p>
<p>confidence of the public, the confidence of our corpor-
</p>
<p>ate employers, and confidence in and respect for one
</p>
<p>another."
</p>
<p>" There are many hundred thousand persons scat-
</p>
<p>tered throughout the civilized world whose money is
</p>
<p>invested in railway properties. These are they whom
</p>
<p>we serve. These are they whose property is intrusted
</p>
<p>to our care. Unknown to us individually, and we to
</p>
<p>them, these people confide in us, trust us, look to us
</p>
<p>to faithfully administer their shares, be they large or
</p>
<p>small, of the railways of the land. Supreme over this
</p>
<p>is the abiding confidence of the people in our skill, our
</p>
<p>watchfulness, our sobriety, our intelligence, our man-
</p>
<p>hood."
</p>
<p>" And this leads me to the thought that there must
</p>
<p>be mutual confidence between the railway corporations

</p>
<p>is the seed of discord, and discord is the growing plant
</p>
<p>upon which danger blossoms  danger to yourselves,
</p>
<p>to the millions whom you move, and to the great com-
</p>
<p>mercial interests of this free and progressive land in
</p>
<p>which we live."
</p>
<p>"I speak whereof I know, when I affirm that the
</p>
<p>managing officers of the great railway corporations
</p>
<p>spare no effort consistent with good discipline to create
</p>
<p>and foster a family feeling, a feeling of close relation-
</p>
<p>ship between the corporation and the men. When
</p>
<p>formed, such a bond of union is a strong one, and is
</p>
<p>transmitted from father to son. To me there is no
</p>
<p>pleasanter sight than to see father and son working
</p>
<p>upon the same road ; to see boys growing up trained
</p>
<p>to usefulness and manliness by the corporation which
</p>
<p>the father has served long and faithfully. It begets a
</p>
<p>community of interest which manifests itself in such
</p>
<p>loyal expressions as " My engine," " My station,"
</p>
<p>" Our road," " Our company." Said an old engineer
</p>
<p>to me some years ago: " My love is divided between
</p>
<p>my engine and my wife." I hope you ladies will for-
</p>
<p>give me for naming his engine first."
</p>
<p>" Be manly, frank and just in your relations with the
</p>
<p>officers of the railroads which you serve. Nearly all
</p>
<p>these men have risen from the ranks and appreciate
</p>
<p>the value of human labor, be it of the muscle or of the
</p>
<p>brain. The little autocrats of narrow views and brief
</p>
<p>authority grow fewer in number year by year, and so
</p>
<p>do the captious, dissatisfied, fault-finding engineers."
</p>
<p>" For my part, after laboring in various capacities
</p>
<p>from boyhood, I am convinced that it is as unwise for

<p>the engineer to serve a corporation in which he lacks

</p>
<p>confidence, as it is for a corporation to retain in its em-
</p>
<p>ploy an engineer whom it cannot trust. The faith
</p>
<p>must be mutual, the respect be well grounded upon
</p>
<p>both sides. The confidence must be absolute and un-
</p>
<p>qualified; and right dealing, truthfulness, honesty of
</p>
<p>purpose, consideration by each for the rights of the
</p>
<p>other, form the pedestal upon which this confidence
</p>
<p>must rest."
</p>
<p>" Success in your vocation makes faith in mankind
</p>
<p>a necessity. You must have faith in the men who
</p>
<p>make the steel and iron from which the boilers,
</p>
<p>wheels, axles and other parts of your engines are con-
</p>
<p>structed; faith in the man who designs the engines;
</p>
<p>faith in the men who build them ; faith in the men who
</p>
<p>repair them ; faith in the men who make the rails they
</p>
<p>run on; faith in the trackmen; faith in the bridgemen;
</p>
<p>the switch tenders, the signal men, the conductors and
</p>
<p>brakemen; faith in your brother engineers who meet
</p>
<p>and pass and follow you on the road ; faith in the man-
</p>
<p>ager and his lieutenants, and, above all, faith in the
</p>
<p>matchless love of the tender wife whose lonely hours
</p>
<p>are full of anxiety, but whose face lightens with joy
</p>
<p>each time you return safely from a trip over the line."
</p>
<p>"Your labor has a market value. Your labor can
</p>
<p>be bought and sold; but loyalty! loyalty is priceless.
</p>
<p>It is founded on respect, on mutual trust and confi-
</p>
<p>dence, and its mainspring is duty. Duty! The watch-
</p>
<p>word of the engineer."

</p>
<p>" A man stands for thirty seconds with his nerves
</p>
<p>like steel; one hand on the throttle, the other on the
</p>
<p>reverse lever; the brake set; the engine reversed; the
</p>
<p>sand running to make the brakes hold; a train of hu-
</p>
<p>man beings behind him; he stands for them between
</p>
<p>life and death! He saves them! That is duty! The
</p>
<p>wages of a lifetime would not buy that thirty seconds
</p>
<p>of nerve and strain."
</p>
<p>" Loyalty and duty are not for sale. Money can
</p>
<p>not purchase them. Wealth, position, power and
</p>
<p>other considerations bribe ambitious men into the sem-
</p>
<p>blance of loyalty and the semblance of unselfish devo-
</p>
<p>tion to duty ; but tear aside the veil that hides the in-
</p>
<p>ner man, and it is seen that the motives are ignoble
</p>
<p>and the apparent loyalty and duty are hollow shams."
</p>
<p>" Your labor and your skill, not your moral qualities,
</p>
<p>are what you sell. Your labor and your skill are made
</p>
<p>more valuable by your moral qualities. Sobriety,
</p>
<p>truth, justice, morality, loyalty, duty, thrift, industry
</p>
<p>and intelligence may not add materially to your
</p>
<p>physical powers, to the skill of your hand, to the
</p>
<p>quickness of your eye, or to }^our bodily activity ; but
</p>
<p>they make you noble men, worthy citizens of a great
</p>
<p>nation, and respected and reliable representatives of
</p>
<p>the greatest instrument of commerce which the civil-
</p>
<p>ized world has produced."
</p>
<p>" In his address one year ago, your Grand Chief
</p>
<p>used these words : " We have taken, upon the adoption
</p>
<p>of our motto, Sobriety, Truth, Justice and Morality, a
</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.
</p>
<p>CONCENTRATION OF FORCES.
</p>
<p>Mr. Potter was gone. The official force of the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington was so changed as to leave none that felt in
</p>
<p>any way lenient towards the men of strength and dar-
</p>
<p>ing, whose toil brings the money to the treasury. The
</p>
<p>men in office in 1888 were vain of their good standing
</p>
<p>with the* company. The ambition of each one was to
</p>
<p>stand first in the esteem of the directors as making the
</p>
<p>least outlay for repairs and for wages, and as bringing
</p>
<p>in the largest returns for work. Egotists in their line,
</p>
<p>self-applauding, lordly men they were; their hearts
</p>
<p>without a window open towards labor, the general
</p>
<p>manager was  Stone. Superintendent Thompson, as
</p>
<p>we have seen, tried to prevent the brakemen from
</p>
<p>organizing; officers and conductors combined to defeat
</p>
<p>the switchmen at St. Louis, in 1886; and in the same
</p>
<p>year Mr. Stone had shown himself relentless in his
</p>
<p>methods in the freight handlers' strike in Chicago.
</p>
<p>The officials seemed eager for the fray. Preparations
</p>
<p>were made for a contest with any labor movement
</p>
<p>that should present itself. The shops were enclosed
</p>
<p>with high, tight .board fences, made to be easily guard-
</p>
<p>ed. Advertisements were published in the newspapers
</p>
<p>of England in November, 1887, calling for railway
</p>
<p>men as if the officials, like the Arabian charger,
</p>
<p>smelled the battle afar off. George Cuff, an engineer

<p>of Paddington, London, stated that the advertisemen.

<p>
</p>
<p>called for from 500 to 1000 first-class engineers for the
</p>
<p>service of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy com-
</p>
<p>pany. They were wanted to open a new road 1200
</p>
<p>miles long, and special inducements accompanied this
</p>
<p>notice. 1 Taking all official conduct into account, we
</p>
<p>can arrive at only one conclusion  that the Burlington
</p>
<p>officials, Messrs. Perkins and Stone, backed by the
</p>
<p>Boston stockholders, were courting a fight with their
</p>
<p>employes, and so managed that a contest became in-
</p>
<p>evitable.
</p>
<p>Local officers were quick to take the cue. A cor-
</p>
<p>respondent at Lincoln, Nebraska, in a letter said: I am
</p>
<p>directed to inform all the divisions on the Burlington
</p>
<p>system, that we are in a worse situation here in
</p>
<p>regard to grievances, than we were before the settle-
</p>
<p>ment. Men are being laid off for little offenses of no
</p>
<p>importance whatever. Master Mechanic Hawksworth
</p>
<p>of Plattsmouth, on November 11, 1887, ordered Engi-
</p>
<p>neer Bosley laid off for ten days for refusing to go on
</p>
<p>an extra train without his breakfast. This engineer
</p>
<p>had waited for this train four hours without pay.
</p>
<p>Breakfast was ready as the train arrived and the engi-
</p>
<p>neer says he consumed fifteen minutes eating, and was
</p>
<p>laid off ten days because he did not go hungry. The
</p>
<p>train not showing any delav, Master Mechanic West,
</p>
<p>of Burlington, told Committeeman J. A. Cuyken-
</p>
<p>dall that there was no delayed time to be allowed on
</p>
<p>local runs. This is where the most work is done for
</p>
<p>nothing.
</p>
<p>In February, Engineer W. H. Wilder went to Mr.
</p>
<p>West to get errors in his time corrected, he not being
</p>
<p>paid according to his age as an engineer, and during

<p>his stay was roundly cursed, the oaths being repeated
</p>
<p>several times. The men at Burlington had waited on
</p>
<p>the superintendent and entered complaint of the treat-
</p>
<p>ment by the master mechanic, and had received assur-
</p>
<p>ance that it should be stopped. When this occurred
</p>
<p>they were much incensed, and asked the grievance
</p>
<p>committee to try and have Mr. West removed, or se-
</p>
<p>cure an assurance that they should have respectful
</p>
<p>treatment in the future. Serious complaint was made
</p>
<p>by the men on the St. Louis division, against the mas-
</p>
<p>ter mechanic and the roundhouse foreman, for violation
</p>
<p>of the rules which were made in 1886. We call at-
</p>
<p>tention to a few of these complaints to show the ne-
</p>
<p>cessity of laws to govern and hold in subjection, officials
</p>
<p>assuming authority that did not belong to their posi-
</p>
<p>tion
</p>
<p>The companies have an unquestionable right to fix
</p>
<p>conditions and to manage their own affairs ; to appoint
</p>
<p>agents and to delegate to them authority to hire and
</p>
<p>discharge and transact the business of the company.
</p>
<p>But their duty does not stop here. These companies
</p>
<p>have reached such magnitude that they control the la-
</p>
<p>bor market, and the laboring man has virtually no op-
</p>
<p>tion but to accept the conditions so fixed by the pow-
</p>
<p>erful corporations. It is simple justice to say that
</p>
<p>they are under moral obligations to form and to exe-
</p>
<p>cute equitable rules for the guidance of the employe of
</p>
<p>whatever grade, whether officer or laborer.
</p>
<p>It is the usual policy of railway administration to
</p>
<p>give individual privileges to hundreds of middle men,

<p>or animosities. This is the grossest injustice. Labor
</p>
<p>has the right to protect itself just the same as capital
</p>
<p>has and it has a right to employ the same methods,
</p>
<p>i. e. to concentrate its force,  moral, social or political 
</p>
<p>and to express it through its own chosen representa-
</p>
<p>tives. Moreover, the rules made in 1886, after so

<p>much effort by the engineers, having been practically
</p>
<p>annulled by the local officers, the men who felt them-
</p>
<p>selves aggrieved and injured, resolved to seek redress
</p>
<p>by all legal and honorable means. Naturally, the
</p>
<p>grievances accumulated in the hands of the grievance

<p>ing a meeting and devising some definite remedial

<p>CHAPTER XXIV.
</p>
<p>COMMITTEE OF 1 888 AND ITS WORK.
</p>
<p>The chairman of the grievance committee, Mr. J.
</p>
<p>C.Porter, at the earnest solicitation of men all along the
</p>
<p>line, convened the committee at Burlington on January
</p>
<p>23, 1888. In the meantime Mr. Porter had written the
</p>
<p>Grand Chief, P. M. Arthur, that he contemplated re-
</p>
<p>signing from the committee, and he received the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing letter, which was read to the committee :
</p>
<p>Cleveland, Ohio, January 24, 1888.
</p>
<p>Dear Brother Porter:
</p>
<p>Your letter received and noted. If the brothers
</p>
<p>are united upon the system and ready to sacrifice their
</p>
<p>situations if necessary to accomplish what they want,
</p>
<p>I think they will succeed. On the contrary, if they
</p>
<p>are actuated by a spirit of selfishness and jealousy,
</p>
<p>no good will come from their meeting. I do not blame
</p>
<p>you for wanting to resign as chairman, yet I do not
</p>
<p>think it would be wise to do so unless the committee
</p>
<p>require it, as we want conservative men in such posi-
</p>
<p>tions. If the committee claim the company has viola-
</p>
<p>ted the agreement they must be prepared to prove it.
</p>
<p>Do not make assertions unless you can substantiate
</p>
<p>them by positive proof. Please keep me informed of
</p>
<p>your progress.
</p>
<p>Yours Fraternally,

</p>
<p>COMMITTEE OF 1 888 AND ITS WORK. 1 27
</p>
<p>It would appear that the men .had abiding faith in
</p>
<p>the justice of their position. Mr. Arthur pictures the
</p>
<p>possible results, advises conservative action, and ends
</p>
<p>by saying, "You must make no assertion you cannot
</p>
<p>positively prove ;" and yet after this dismal picture pur-
</p>
<p>posely giving the dark side, the work is continued.
</p>
<p>Mr. Porter tendered his resignation as he had intend-
</p>
<p>ed to do and was presented with a fine meerschaum
</p>
<p>pipe by the committee, and S. E. Hoge, of McCook,
</p>
<p>Nebraska, was elected to fill the place of chairman.
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the firemen, feeling the
</p>
<p>same necessity for decided action, had organized their
</p>
<p>adjusting committee and had, like the engineers, for-
</p>
<p>mulated grievances and desired rules enacted to govern
</p>
<p>their affairs as well. The firemen recognized that
</p>
<p>whatever was injurious to them, or to the engineers,
</p>
<p>would be detrimental to the future of the firemen as
</p>
<p>they naturally expected to become engineers. Their
</p>
<p>committee was called at the same time and place, but
</p>
<p>they met in separate bodies. Each of these bodies
</p>
<p>deliberated Monday and Tuesday, discussing the va-
</p>
<p>rious* questions, and on Wednesday January 25, both of
</p>
<p>these committees met together as a joint committee.
</p>
<p>This committee was composed of fourteen engineers
</p>
<p>and fourteen firemen.

<p>The union of these two committees was not a new

<p>departure. Engineers and firemen had met jointly

</p>
<p>reinstated men discharged without cause and in viola-
</p>
<p>tion of contract. "It is the natural instinct of man to
</p>
<p>protect himself, and the limits of that protection are
</p>
<p>bounded by the golden rule. The ancient civiliza-
</p>
<p>tion neglected this; the personality of the citizen was
</p>
<p>lost; the individual was made an unlimited slave to an
</p>
<p>unlimited sovereignty, as it is now under some corpo-
</p>
<p>rations of modern times. Man was reduced to slavery,
</p>
<p>and he, and all his interests, subordinated to state des-
</p>
<p>potism. This is what man succeeded in reaching by
</p>
<p>losing the idea of our great Brotherhood under one
</p>
<p>common Fatherhood." 1 The belief in the justice of
</p>
<p>one's position lends courage, and these men composing
</p>
<p>these committees, although Mr. Arthur had shown
</p>
<p>them their difficulties and dangers, had the courage, and
</p>
<p>were convinced of the justice, of their position.
</p>
<p>J. A. Cuykendall, an engineer on the C, B. & Q.
</p>
<p>road was discharged on January 20, 1888. His of-
</p>
<p>fense primarily was his being a member of the General
</p>
<p>Grievance Committee of 1886, and he was still acting
</p>
<p>as such at the date of his discharge. All the facts
</p>
<p>were laid before the Grievance Committee, just formed.
</p>
<p>It seems Mr. Cuykendall had a pendent set watch.
</p>
<p>As every one knows, in order to set the hands the
</p>
<p>stem winding pin must be pulled out to change the
</p>
<p>gear from mainspring to hands. Time was compared,
</p>
<p>according to rule, before starting, and was found to be
</p>
<p>right, but by some means while on the trip his watch
</p>
<p>became eight or nine minutes slow, supposed to be
</p>
<p>caused by a too easily working stem set. As he knew
</p>
<p>nothing about the derangement of the time it was
</p>
<p>reasonable to suppose that in taking the watch from

<p>his pocket, the pin was pulled out enough to catch the
</p>
<p>hands, and move them slightly  a very little makes
</p>
<p>several minutes. On his nearing West Burlington,
</p>
<p>where he expected to meet passenger No. 3, he was
</p>
<p>astonished to find the train was already there, when
</p>
<p>according to the time by his watch he should have been
</p>
<p>there first. He asked his fireman for the time and
</p>
<p>discovered to his astonishment, that his watch was
</p>
<p>wrong. Mr. Cuykendall, according to the rules,
</p>
<p>should have stopped and sent a flagman ahead, but by
</p>
<p>the time he was fully convinced that his time was
</p>
<p>wrong he was so near,  the trains being in clear sight
</p>
<p>of each other,  he concluded to pull in and so delay
</p>
<p>the passenger the least possible. His watch was then
</p>
<p>compared with the conductor's, and with others, and
</p>
<p>found wrong. There was no forgetfulness or careless-
</p>
<p>ness claimed. Mr. Cuvkendall and the conductor
</p>
<p>were both discharged  the conductor because he did
</p>
<p>not give better attention and see that the engineer did
</p>
<p>not commit such an error.
</p>
<p>The Grievance Committee being satisfied that the
</p>
<p>penalty was too severe, took up the matter and asked
</p>
<p>an audience with Superintendent Brown, to see if they
</p>
<p>could not have it modified. The request was granted,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Brown appointed 10:00 a. m., Thursday, Jan-
</p>
<p>uary 26, for the meeting. On January 25, the engi-
</p>
<p>neers and firemen met in joint session, and resolved to
</p>
<p>merge into one set of rules, the conditions desired by
</p>
<p>both Orders, and, as a joint body, present them to the

<p>officials of the company. Each article was then dis-

</p>
<p>dent by reinstating Mr. Cuykendall. The extenua-
</p>
<p>ting circumstances counted nothing. The committee
</p>
<p>believed Master Mechanic West was the influence that
</p>
<p>prevented a rehearing of the case.
</p>
<p>The work of the committee was -nearly completed,
</p>
<p>and they desired to go to Chicago to meet the general
</p>
<p>officers. The chairman, Mr. S. E. Hoge, requested
</p>
<p>Superintendent Brown to furnish transportation, which
</p>
<p>he readily assented to, with the acception of Mr. Cuy-
</p>
<p>kendall, and he would try and get a pass for him, and
</p>
<p>would have all ready by 2 :oo p. m. Passes were giv-
</p>
<p>en, for all, Mr. Cuykendall included. It is against the
</p>
<p>company's rule to give transportation to any employe
</p>
<p>suspended or discharged. To employes who are in
</p>
<p>good standing, the Burlington Company has always
</p>
<p>been fairly liberal. Some officers were more liberal
</p>
<p>than others, yet no fault could be found with the com-
</p>
<p>pany in relation to transportation for their own em-
</p>
<p>ployes. The article in the new rules as presented,
</p>
<p>was merely a request that they be privileged to show
</p>
<p>courtesy to traveling brothers who were known mem-
</p>
<p>bers, and worthy of their confidence and favor.
</p>
<p>The committee believed that the general managers
</p>
<p>could not make a settlement without the consent of
</p>
<p>higher authority, and made their plans to obviate the
</p>
<p>long delay experienced in 1886. Accordingly they
</p>
<p>sent a message to President Perkins, before leaving
</p>
<p>Burlington, notifving him of their desire to meet him

<p>in Chicago, on Monday, January 30, 1888. They then
</p>
<p>132 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>adjourned to meet in Chicago.
</p>
<p>The committee met at the appointed time in the
</p>
<p>parlor of the National hotel. S. E. Hoge, chairman
</p>
<p>of the engineer's committee, was made chairman of
</p>
<p>the joint committee, and J. H. Murphy, chairman of
</p>
<p>the firemen's committee, secretary. On Tuesday,
</p>
<p>January 31, a message was received from Mr. Perkins
</p>
<p>stating that he would be in Boston soon and would
</p>
<p>meet the committee in Boston the next week, if they
</p>
<p>so desired; but suggested that the committee meet
</p>
<p>the general managers and said he did not intend to
</p>
<p>come west very soon, as he had just come from
</p>
<p>there. The committee knowing it was useless to see the
</p>
<p>general manager, without his presence, or author-
</p>
<p>ity delegated by him to the managers, sent another
</p>
<p>message saying: "The General Grievance Committee
</p>
<p>of the w r hole system is here. Cannot make settle-
</p>
<p>ment with the general manager. Will you come ?"
</p>
<p>S. E. Hoge.
</p>
<p>On February 7> a message was received from Pres-
</p>
<p>ident Perkins, saying that he had written a letter to
</p>
<p>the committee from Boston, which was received by
</p>
<p>the chairman on the 2nd, in which Mr. Perkins re-
</p>
<p>quested that they meet with the general managers of
</p>
<p>the several roads composing the Burlington system.
</p>
<p>In compliance with this, an effort was made to obtain
</p>
<p>the desired interview. General Manager Stone was
</p>
<p>supposed to be in Washington, and on February 3, a
</p>
<p>message was sent to him asking an audience. On
</p>
<p>Saturday, February 4, agreeable to appointment with

<p>Superintendent Besler, the committee went to his of-
</p>
<p>COMMITTEE OE 1 888 AND ITS WORK. 1 33
</p>
<p>rice to make another effort in Mr. Cuykendall's be-
</p>
<p>half. They found Mr. Besler accompanied by Mr.
</p>
<p>Steward, assistant superintendent at Burlington, who
</p>
<p>read a long statement, going to show that Mr. Cuy-
</p>
<p>kendall had been careless on the whole trip. It was
</p>
<p>evident they were anxious to be rid of a member of
</p>
<p>the committee who tried to make the officers comply
</p>
<p>with the law. Mr. Besler was finally asked to say
</p>
<p>positively what he would do, whether he would rein-
</p>
<p>state him or not, and he answered, " No, I will not."
</p>
<p>The matter was referred to Mr. Stone, later.
</p>
<p>Some of the engineers' committee of 1888 had been
</p>
<p>also of the committee of 1886. The long siege then,
</p>
<p>through the absence of the leading officials, and their
</p>
<p>inability at this time to secure a meeting, did not por-
</p>
<p>tend an easy solution of their difficulties. To have all
</p>
<p>the men along the line understand the situation, they
</p>
<p>reported progress, and requested that all members of
</p>
<p>the order should assemble and vote to sustain, or not,
</p>
<p>the action of their committee. Accordingly a letter
</p>
<p>was addressed to all points along the line, asking that
</p>
<p>all members of both engineers', and the firemen's
</p>
<p>Brotherhood should vote as to whether they would
</p>
<p>sustain the General Grievance Committee in demand-
</p>
<p>ing the enactment of such rules as seemed to them just
</p>
<p>and necessary. 1st, To sustain the committee, yes or

<p>no. 2nd, For total abolition of classification, yes or no.

<p>of the Burlington.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXV.
</p>
<p>LOYALTY OF ENGINEERS AND FIREMEN.
</p>
<p>The engineers of the Burlington were men of up-
</p>
<p>right and unselfish character. They were of an inde-
</p>
<p>pendent cast of thought; they were generous and
</p>
<p>broad minded men. These qualities are clearly
</p>
<p>brought out at the close of the last chapter, but they
</p>
<p>are still better represented in the history of the ./Han-
</p>
<p>nibal & St. Joseph railroad before it came into the pos-
</p>
<p>session of the Burlington. When Col. R. S. Stevens
</p>
<p>was general manager of this road  then a separate
</p>
<p>property,  the road was in a very bad financial con-
</p>
<p>dition. Mr. Stevens looked around for some means
</p>
<p>of retrenchment, by which he could tide over the de-
</p>
<p>pression. In pursuit of a method he addressed a letter
</p>
<p>to the engineers, stating the necessities that beset his
</p>
<p>management, and asked them whether they could not
</p>
<p>help him until such time as business should improve.
</p>
<p>To this appeal these men responded by immediately ap-
</p>
<p>pointing a committee, who went to Hannibal, the head-
</p>
<p>quarters of this road, and the members of the commit-
</p>
<p>tee from Brookfield, Mo., joined those of the committee
</p>
<p>who lived in Hannibal, and with such interest as men feel
</p>
<p>over their own affairs, they consulted as to how much
</p>
<p>they could spare from their daily pay to help the gen-
</p>
<p>eral manager past his difficulties. They settled upon
</p>
<p>an amount of temporary reduction, met with Mr. Ste-

</p>
<p>vens at his office and gave him the result. Mr. Ste-
</p>
<p>1 36 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>vens was highly pleased, and gave them a letter of
</p>
<p>thanks, and a written promise to restore the pay when-
</p>
<p>ever business would justify it. In this he accom-
</p>
<p>plished, by gentlemanly methods, and a due considera-
</p>
<p>tion of the second party, what he could not do arbitra-
</p>
<p>rilv, or bv force.
</p>
<p>In 1877, one G. B. Simonds became general master
</p>
<p>mechanic, who removed the division master mechanic
</p>
<p>at Brookfield, and put in one of his own kind, and a
</p>
<p>system of prosecution was inaugurated that culminated
</p>
<p>in an effort to secure the removal of this tyrant.
</p>
<p>Division 29, then located at Brookfield, appointed a
</p>
<p>committee who went to New York city to see the di-
</p>
<p>rectors and have a stop put to the wholesale discharge,
</p>
<p>and the gross misuse of the men. This would have
</p>
<p>succeeded had it not been for a Benedict Arnold, in
</p>
<p>the person of George Jennings, who, on the promise of
</p>
<p>a place as division master mechanic, started a counter
</p>
<p>petition, and, securing a few names, succeeded in
</p>
<p>breaking up the harmony of the Order. Through this
</p>
<p>petition, G. B. Simonds held his place for the time be-
</p>
<p>ing; and the consequence was that every Brotherhood
</p>
<p>man, not already discharged, was sent away with rea-
</p>
<p>son, or without. This tyrant was allowed full sway.
</p>
<p>The old and tried men were exchanged for any men
</p>
<p>not members of the Brotherhood. There were some
</p>
<p>-good men among the new, but the average was ex-
</p>
<p>tremely bad. The members of the division being dis-
</p>
<p>charged, their charter was surrendered and the organ-
</p>
<p>ization ceased to exist at that point. Wreck and disas-
</p>
<p>ter followed. The company, through its petted and

<p>to reap the whirlwind, as the natural outcome of its
</p>
<p>violence against justice and fair treatment. The com-
</p>
<p>pany becoming convinced of the unprofitableness of
</p>
<p>this course, removed the master mechanic, and T. G.
</p>
<p>Gorman was appointed, who adopted a different pol-
</p>
<p>icy. The Simonds bum element was weeded out, and
</p>
<p>many of the old men came back and took their places.
</p>
<p>Peace and good order returned. Some who had
</p>
<p>been members of Division 29, which had been broken
</p>
<p>up by Simonds, organized what is now known as Di-
</p>
<p>vision 79. In all this time, this company had forgot-
</p>
<p>ten that these men had reduced their own pay, on a
</p>
<p>written promise that it should be restored, and during
</p>
<p>the unorganized condition of the men, the company
</p>
<p>had ordered and executed another reduction. In 1883
</p>
<p>the road was under the management of Mr. John B.
</p>
<p>Carson, a gentleman and a thorough business man.
</p>
<p>The traffic, under his management, had increased to
</p>
<p>the full capacity of the motive power of the company.
</p>
<p>The men were being paid less than were any of their
</p>
<p>neighbors. A committer was appointed by Division
</p>
<p>79, to wait on Mr. Carson, and they took with them
</p>
<p>the written promise of the company, given by General
</p>
<p>Manager Stevens, and proceeded to Hannibal, Mo.,
</p>
<p>the headquarters of the road. On their arrival they
</p>
<p>found General Manager Carson was in New York
</p>
<p>city, and they awaited his return, with entire confi-
</p>
<p>dence in his honor and integrity. On his arrival, he
</p>
<p>met the committee, and a settlement was made; classi-
</p>
<p>ification was done away with, and they were paid the
</p>
<p>same rate as their neighbors, as will be seen in the fol-
</p>

<p>or $80 per month, a da}''s work to be twelve hours.
</p>
<p>Engineers dela}-ed over two hours shall receive 35c.
</p>
<p>per hour, after the expiration of the first two hours.
</p>
<p>The pay for short runs to be fixed by the undersigned
</p>
<p>on a mileage basis, the extra work, switching, etc., to
</p>
<p>be considered. The firemen's pay to be increased
</p>
<p>proportionately the same as engineers, taking as a ba-

<p>cal performance of your duties, equal to the additional

</p>
<p>compensation you receive, we will come out even in
</p>
<p>the end, and I have confidence in believing you will all
</p>
<p>try to accomplish this.
</p>
<p>With best wishes I am
</p>
<p>Yours Very Respectfully,
</p>
<p>John B. Carson, General Manager.
</p>
<p>Here is an instance of friendly intercourse, of mu-
</p>
<p>tual interest, which naturally comes of a considerate
</p>
<p>management. These relations continued pleasant dur-
</p>
<p>ing Mr. Carson's stay; but the Chicago, Burlington
</p>
<p>& Quincy Co. reached out its strong arms and secured
</p>
<p>the control of the Hannibal & St. Joseph railroad. Mr.
</p>
<p>Carson went to the Louisville, New Albany & Chica-
</p>
<p>go railroad, and the Hannibal & St. Joseph railroad was
</p>
<p>placed under Burlington rules. A notice was posted
</p>
<p>that on and after November i, 1885, all men promot-
</p>
<p>ed in the engine department would be classified, and
</p>
<p>the doors were suddenly closed upon the employment of
</p>
<p>engineers from other roads. This was a startling ex-
</p>
<p>ercise of power. It was a widening of the domain of
</p>
<p>classification, which drove away contentment and har-
</p>
<p>mony wherever it went. Their pay on the mileage
</p>
<p>plan was not disturbed. The General Grievance Com-
</p>
<p>mittee was asking the Burlington to adopt the same
</p>
<p>standard of three and a half cents on passenger, and four
</p>
<p>cents per mile on freight : yet they were so much im-
</p>
<p>pressed with the evil of classification, that when they
</p>
<p>were asked to vote to sustain the General Grievance
</p>
<p>Committee, and vote on the abolition of classification,
</p>
<p>they voted unanimously to do away with a rule that

</p>
<p>had in it such an evil tendency. Their social relations
</p>
<p>LOYALTY OF ENGINEERS AND FIREMEN. I4I
</p>
<p>with the officers were pleasant. Their pay was sat-
</p>
<p>isfactory to those who were past the year of probation.
</p>
<p>They deserve the credit of an unselfish devotion to
</p>
<p>principle, in lending their assistance, and risking their
</p>
<p>future by enlisting in a common cause, for a common
</p>
<p>good. Had the right principle of apprenticeship been
</p>
<p>adopted, these men could not have been so completely
</p>
<p>united as they were. Apprenticeship has always had
</p>
<p>defenders; it has yet. There is no question that
</p>
<p>the engineers and firemen would willingly accept a re-
</p>
<p>duction of wages, equal to the difference between a
</p>
<p>tried man and an untried one. The Baltimore & Ohio
</p>
<p>road pays ten per cent less than first-class for one
</p>
<p>year, then full pay. Here are just principles. But on
</p>
<p>the Burlington, under classification, a difference of 33
</p>
<p>per cent is demanded first year, and 16 per cent for the
</p>
<p>second year, then full pay; and employ no one who
</p>
<p>cannot be used at these reductions, consequently no

<p>JOINT COMMITTEE SEEKING AN INTERVIEW.
</p>
<p>On Monday, February 6, having heard nothing
</p>
<p>from Mr. Stone, another message was sent him asking
</p>
<p>an answer by 1:00 p. m. Not receiving any answer,
</p>
<p>the committee concluded they did not intend to grant
</p>
<p>a hearing. They concluded to send another dispatch
</p>
<p>to Mr. Perkins, and tell him they had sent two mes-
</p>
<p>sages to Mr. Stone and had received no answer, and
</p>
<p>that they would wait three days for him to come and
</p>
<p>meet the committee, and that if he did not come, then
</p>
<p>they would put the matter in the hands of the two
</p>
<p>grand officers, Messrs. Arthur and Sargent. To this
</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins answered on Wednesday, February 7:
</p>
<p>"S. E. Hoge: Message received. Mr. Stone probably
</p>
<p>did not get your message; he is on his way from
</p>
<p>Washington and will be in New York to-day, and I
</p>
<p>will talk with him." ' The first dispatch sent to Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone might not have found him, the second one did.
</p>
<p>The Knights of Labor had a strike in Pennsylvania,
</p>
<p>on December 24, 1887. It was not a railroad strike,
</p>
<p>but it involved railroad men who were members of
</p>
<p>that Order. From subsequent developments it is
</p>
<p>reasonable to suppose that Mr. Stone did not desire to
</p>
<p>answer until he knew the purport of the dissatisfaction,
</p>
<p>and whether it could be made useful. A message was
</p>
<p>finally received from him and read to the committee
</p>
<p>on the 8th, and Mr. Perkins was so notified, and that

</p>
<p>they would confer with him later. Mr. Holdridge was
</p>
<p>then heard from, and the chairman asked for an audi-
</p>
<p>ence, and he was answered that they could not grant
</p>
<p>it until the next Wednesday. Five days more of wait-
</p>
<p>ing was no small item to this committee of twenty-
</p>
<p>eight men, yet the delay was accepted with good
</p>
<p>grace.
</p>
<p>The committee believed the adverse railroad legis-
</p>
<p>lation in the state of Iowa was extreme, and that it
</p>
<p>would be detrimental to both the railroads and the
</p>
<p>common good of the state. They drafted a me-
</p>
<p>morial to be presented to that legislature against
</p>
<p>the adoption of the two cent per mile rate. They then
</p>
<p>appointed a committee composed of F. P. McDonald,
</p>
<p>of St Joseph, Mo., George W. Wheatly, of Beards-
</p>
<p>town, 111., and Wm. Fowler, of McCook, Neb., who
</p>
<p>were instructed to present the memorial. This would
</p>
<p>indicate that while they were trying to secure equity
</p>
<p>of a railroad company, they were not unmindful of the
</p>
<p>interests of railroads.
</p>
<p>On Monday, February 13, a committee was ap-
</p>
<p>pointed to present the subject of the dismissal of their
</p>
<p>brother, J. A. Cuykendall, to Mr. Stone on the next
</p>
<p>day, and see if he would not reverse or modify the de-
</p>
<p>cision of Superintendents Brown and Besler. On
</p>
<p>Wednesday, February 15, this committee called and
</p>
<p>presented the matter, and Mr. Stone wanted to see the
</p>
<p>watch that had caused the discharge. In his decision,
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone said he could not reverse the decision of
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown on general principles. Not because the
</p>
<p>watch stopped and started again, losing eight or nine

<p>minutes, causing him to get on a passenger train's

</p>
<p>time, but he must sustain the decision because the
</p>
<p>engineer did not flag when he saw the train, and that
</p>
<p>he did n'ot protect himself according to the rules.
</p>
<p>The committee believed that had Mr. Cuykendall
</p>
<p>never served on a committee, he would not have been
</p>
<p>discharged. Mr. Stone's decision is what every en-
</p>
<p>gineer expects for violation of rules. We only
</p>
<p>cite this case to show the liability of the engineer,
</p>
<p>and the extremely narrow path he must walk to keep
</p>
<p>his position. It will also serve for contrast in the fu-
</p>
<p>ture conduct of this company, in violating every prin-
</p>
<p>ciple enunciated in this decision. Mr. Cuykendall was
</p>
<p>still a member of the General Grievance Committee,
</p>
<p>and on receiving Mr. Stone's decision, he resigned.
</p>
<p>The committee asked Mr. Stone to give him a letter,
</p>
<p>which he readily did, stating cause of dismissal, and
</p>
<p>requesting whom it may concern to write to him for
</p>
<p>reference, as to character and ability, and he also gave
</p>
<p>him a pass over the Burlington. If his membership
</p>
<p>on the Grievance Committee did not influence the de-
</p>
<p>cision, and was in line with the Burlington's strict dis-
</p>
<p>cipline only, Mr. Stone's action was more than usually
</p>
<p>considerate. The Burlington rule, as has been stated
</p>
<p>before, is that passes are not to be given to suspended
</p>
<p>or discharged employes; and usually when the dis-
</p>
<p>charged employe asks for a letter, he is told by the of-
</p>
<p>ficial, " You can refer to me when you find a place."
</p>
<p>Mr. Cuykendall went to the general manager of the
</p>
<p>Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific, and received a letter
</p>
<p>from Mr. St. John, which secured him a place without
</p>
<p>much delay. The extenuating circumstances in this

<p>case, no doubt influenced Mr. Stone to give the letter

</p>
<p>and pass, and perhaps secured a place for Mr. Cuy-
</p>
<p>kendall with the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific; still
</p>
<p>it would seem that if he was a good man for Mr. St.
</p>
<p>John, he ought to be for Mr. Stone.
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrill, general manager of the Kansas City,
</p>
<p>St. Joseph & Council Bluff, and Hannibal & St. Jo-
</p>
<p>seph Divisions, and Mr. Besler, general superintend-
</p>
<p>ent of the Illinois lines, were present at this meeting,
</p>
<p>and the subject matter which had convened the com-
</p>
<p>mittee was taken up. Complaint was made of the
</p>
<p>violation of the rules of 1886 by the local officers.
</p>
<p>After considerable discussion upon the subject, Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone said he was glad the committee had come, that
</p>
<p>he was going to make some changes in the divisions of
</p>
<p>the road, and he would run the engines from Gales-
</p>
<p>burg to Hawthorne, the freight yard in the suburb of
</p>
<p>Chicago. He said he expected it would make some
</p>
<p>dissatisfaction among the men and they could settle the
</p>
<p>whole thing at once. The reason he expected dissatis-
</p>
<p>faction was: The men lived in Aurora, and to run
</p>
<p>through Aurora to Hawthorne would oblige them to
</p>
<p>move to Galesburg, unless thev would allow the crews
</p>
<p>to change at Aurora and the same engine go through.
</p>
<p>A protest was entered, not against the engines run-
</p>
<p>ning from Galesburg to Chicago, but against being
</p>
<p>compelled to move away from Aurora. In discussing
</p>
<p>the schedule presented, the chairman, Mr. Hoge, told
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone that they wanted the pay fixed on the mile-
</p>
<p>age basis. Mr. Stone answered that he did not have
</p>
<p>authority to make a full settlement for the whole sys-
</p>
<p>tem, until he could hear from Mr. Perkins. He then

<p>asked if the committee would grant him two days to
</p>
<p>IjJ.6 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>look over the schedule and confer with his subordi-
</p>
<p>nates. This was granted. Mr. Hoge asked Mr. Stone
</p>
<p>if he would meet the grand officers, and he said he
</p>
<p>would. The business arrangements being completed,
</p>
<p>the committee retired. Mr. Stone, and the official
</p>
<p>force at hand, immediately set to work preparing the
</p>
<p>printed circular letter so widely circulated later. They
</p>
<p>succeeded admirably in showing up their side of the
</p>
<p>question; but one very grave oversight in the business of
</p>
<p>the committee, which future developments proved, was
</p>
<p>not preparing themselves with counter proof showing
</p>
<p>the justice of their position. While we are waiting
</p>
<p>for Mr. Stone to secure the authority he lacked, let us
</p>
<p>look at this letter with the light let in on both sides of
</p>
<p>the controversy. We shall see that this letter, prepar-
</p>
<p>ed with such care and in such elegance, was not intend-
</p>
<p>ed for the eye of the engineers and firemen only. It
</p>
<p>is evident it was intended for the use to which it was
</p>
<p>put. It was an appeal to the public. It was full of
</p>
<p>half truths well put and plausibly argued. It was evident
</p>
<p>that they did not dream of concessions to these protest-
</p>
<p>ing employes. The pamphlet contained twenty-four
</p>
<p>pages purporting to be a candid appeal to these dis-
</p>
<p>affected men. It was filled with statements that were
</p>
<p>grossly unjust to the men and misleading to the public.

<p>THE CIRCULAR LETTER ANSWERED.
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the strike did not occur
</p>
<p>until February 27, and considerable time must have
</p>
<p>been consumed in the preparation of this document.
</p>
<p>It gives a statement of wages paid first, second and
</p>
<p>third year, on 166 different runs and conditions; four
</p>
<p>pages of this elaborate document are given to discus-
</p>
<p>sion of the company's side of the question, and giving
</p>
<p>a highly colored representation of wages paid, stating

<p>what men were paid without telling how much work
</p>
<p>was done for it. Below is a copy of the title page.

</p>
<p>to induce them to stay with the company. But the main
</p>
<p>object was to bias public opinion, and there is no doubt
</p>
<p>that it did very powerfully and erroneously affect the
</p>
<p>general reader. It was evidently intended for the
</p>
<p>newspapers, and to them it went, and thousands
</p>
<p>read it and formed opinions that to this day have re-
</p>
<p>mained unchanged. We propose to pay our respects
</p>
<p>to this document, and we shall leave the reader to
</p>
<p>characterize it after he shall have seen it dissected.
</p>
<p>This document starts out by saying : A committee
</p>
<p>of your number presented, on February 15, 1888, for-
</p>
<p>our consideration, a schedule, marked " A," attached
</p>
<p>hereto, providing for a new basis and rate of pay for
</p>
<p>enginemen. The schedule marked "B," also at-
</p>
<p>tached, gives rules of April 1, 1886, governing the pay
</p>
<p>of engineers and firemen in force upon all lines, and also
</p>
<p>the schedule of wages for the C, B. & Q. proper.
</p>
<p>The important changes which your committee sug-
</p>
<p>gests are as follows :
</p>
<p>" ' 1st. Pay to be governed solely by the miles run,
</p>
<p>without regard to other conditions or circumstances,"
</p>
<p>" ' 2nd. A large average increase in existing rates of
</p>
<p>pay.'"
</p>
<p>" ' 3rd. The abolition of any classification based upon
</p>
<p>length of service, age, or experience."'
</p>
<p>You are requested to carefully consider the , follow-
</p>
<p>ing objections to these suggestions:
</p>
<p>" 1 st. That our present basis is in force upon many
</p>
<p>important railroads in this country, and is preferred
</p>
<p>because it is the best one to fairly provide for differ-
</p>
<p>ences in the amount of labor, time and responsibility re-

<p>quired of enginemen upon different runs and divisions."
</p>
<p>THE CIRCULAR LETTER ANSWERED. 1 49
</p>
<p>" A branch passenger engine hauling two or three
</p>
<p>cars where there are two trains each way daily, is
</p>
<p>more easily handled than an important main line pas-
</p>
<p>senger engine where there are twenty or more trains
</p>
<p>each way."
</p>
<p>" A branch freight engine hauling eight or ten cars,
</p>
<p>with easy and regular hours, and by daylight, de-
</p>
<p>mands less labor from enginemen than an engine on
</p>
<p>the main line with a heavy freight train, although the
</p>
<p>mileage may be the same."
</p>
<p>"The trip basis, in view of all the varying condi-
</p>
<p>tions, covers value received. An arbitrary mileage
</p>
<p>basis disregards the value of the service rendered, and
</p>
<p>in the long run, we fear, would be unsatisfactory to
</p>
<p>the men and to the company." For example:
</p>
<p>" On the Galesburg Division of the C, B. & Q.
</p>
<p>railroad, an engineer on a light passenger run of two
</p>
<p>cars between Buda and Vermont, under the present
</p>
<p>schedule earns in twenty-six (26) days, $123.50, and
</p>
<p>the fireman $74.10; under the schedule which you
</p>
<p>propose the engineer would receive $171.08, and the
</p>
<p>fireman $102.64."
</p>
<p>One hundred miles constitutes a day's work on all
</p>
<p>roads, and the run being 188 miles, the enginemen run
</p>
<p>4888 miles in the twenty-six days, and consequentlv
</p>
<p>work 48 and 2-5 days to earn $123.50, and the tire-
</p>
<p>men $74.10. Had this letter been for the purpose of
</p>
<p>discussing the issue with the enginemen, the question
</p>
<p>of miles would certainly have entered into the discus-
</p>
<p>sion. Again they say:
</p>

</p>
<p>train of three cars, requiring six hours and ten minutes
</p>
<p>daily, is paying under the existing schedule, to engin-
</p>
<p>eers, $144.00 per month. Upon your schedule it
</p>
<p>would pay $189.00 per month."
</p>
<p>Here again is 188 miles to run every day for thirty
</p>
<p>days in the month to get this $144.00, fifty-four days'
</p>
<p>work at $2.66 per day. We now come to the
</p>
<p>"Villisca branch:
</p>
<p>" On the Kansas City, St. Joseph & Council Bluff's
</p>
<p>railroad, on the run from Villisca to St Joseph and
</p>
<p>return, under the present schedule the engineer earns
</p>
<p>for .a month of twenty-six (26) days, $143.00, and the
</p>
<p>firemen $72.80. Upon the schedule which you pro-
</p>
<p>pose the engineer would receive $199.29 and the fire-
</p>
<p>man $119.60. This is a three-car run, the engineer
</p>
<p>and fireman returning home every night; it is also a
</p>
<p>daylight run."
</p>
<p>To earn this money, the enginemen run 219 miles
</p>
<p>each day, twenty-six days in the month, 5694 miles,
</p>
<p>nearly fifty-seven (57) days' work! Was the distance
</p>
<p>omitted to fool the engineers and firemen to whom it
</p>
<p>was addressed, or to mislead the public? This letter
</p>
<p>then quotes:
</p>
<p>" On the Chicago & Iowa railroad, a light passenger
</p>
<p>run between Rockford and Aurora, which occupies
</p>
<p>four hours and fifty minutes in making the round trip,
</p>
<p>which leaves the engineer at home every night and
</p>
<p>every Sunday, and gives him the greater part of each
</p>
<p>day to himself, pays the engineer at present $104.00
</p>
<p>per month. Under the schedule which you propose
</p>
<p>this run would pay $134.68 per month, which is out

<p>of all proportion."
</p>
<p>THE CIRCULAR LETTER ANSWERED. 151
</p>
<p>Here is one hundred and forty-eight (148) miles to
</p>
<p>run every day, and instead of four hours and fifty min-
</p>
<p>utes, the train leaves at 6:55 a. m., and returns at 8:35
</p>
<p>p. m., thirteen hours and a half; 3848 miles in the
</p>
<p>twenty-six days, or thirty-eight and one-half day's
</p>
<p>work. This letter to the engineers and firemen closes
</p>
<p>these astounding statements with the remarks that:
</p>
<p>" The above examples illustrate that some light runs
</p>
<p>are paid high at present in proportion to the heavy
</p>
<p>runs, where most of the men are employed. Other
</p>
<p>similar cases can be given to show that your schedule
</p>
<p>would create high paid runs, and that it disregards
</p>
<p>what is reasonable to the company, and fair to the
</p>
<p>men."
</p>
<p>I have before me a book containing the schedules
</p>
<p>of over sixty railroads, of which forty-six Contain a
</p>
<p>clause which says: " One. hundred miles, or less, con-
</p>
<p>stitutes a day. All over one hundred miles will be
</p>
<p>paid for at regular rate per mile." Three of the
</p>
<p>other fourteen which pay by the trip, namely: the
</p>
<p>Southern Pacific, the Denver & Rio Grande, and the
</p>
<p>St. Louis & San Francisco, base their pay per trip, on
</p>
<p>the number of miles at three and one-half and four cents
</p>
<p>per mile, the Southern Pacific paying as high as $7-25
</p>
<p>a trip. The Denver and Rio Grande for two hundred
</p>
<p>and seven (207) miles paying $7.90 on passen-
</p>
<p>ger train. There is no condition in any of these
</p>
<p>which specifies three cars or six, as requring less pay
</p>
<p>or more. We find better prices paid by the trip on
</p>
<p>the New York and the New England railway  a Bos-
</p>
<p>ton road  than Mr. Stone was willing to concede, viz:

</p>
<p>Fishkill, on Hudson, $3.75 also; Hartford, Manchester
</p>
<p>& Fishkill, one hundred and twenty (120) miles, $4.00.
</p>
<p>Putnam to Hartford and return, one hundred and
</p>
<p>twelve (112) miles, $3.75. The first two are through
</p>
<p>trains, the last a local.
</p>
<p>Let us compare some runs on other roads with
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone's main line fast mail, which is second to
</p>
<p>none in importance, as they are liable to $500 forfeit if
</p>
<p>the connections are missed. He pays from Aurora to
</p>
<p>Galesburg, one hundred and twenty-five (125) miles,
</p>
<p>$3.75, while if he paid the New York and the New
</p>
<p>England rate, he would pay $4.22. The local turn-
</p>
<p>around run of one hundred and twelve (112) miles,
</p>
<p>New York and New England, pays $3.75. The Bur-
</p>
<p>lington pays from Aurora to Streator and return, one
</p>
<p>hundred and twenty (120) miles, $3.65. If Mr. Stone
</p>
<p>paid the same rate as the New York and the New
</p>
<p>England, this run would bring $4.00. On the Nor-
</p>
<p>folk and Western railroad, the pay of passenger engi-
</p>
<p>neers is based on three cents per mile, and at this rate
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone's Vallisca branch, quoted as paying $143.00
</p>
<p>per month, would pay $170.82. I find the pay for
</p>
<p>passenger service from three cents per mile up to four
</p>
<p>cents, the country over, with a very few roads with
</p>
<p>such rates as the Burlington, and there are no roads
</p>
<p>in the west that could afford to pay better than it
</p>
<p>could before the strike.

<p>firemen get in proportion to engineers' pay:
</p>
<p>On Chicago Division, 65 per cent.

</p>
<p>" St. Louis " 63
</p>
<p>" E. Iowa " 68
</p>
<p>" M. Iowa " 38^
</p>
<p>" W. Iowa " 59^
</p>
<p>On the Middle Iowa Division the engineers must
</p>
<p>have fired for themselves part of the time, as there
</p>
<p>were fewer firemen by thirteen, and the total earned
</p>
<p>by them was only 38^ per cent of the engineers'
</p>
<p>earnings. We must conclude without further discus-
</p>
<p>sion, that this list was made up for effect; the schedule
</p>
<p>all through, on the average, showing the firemens' pay
</p>
<p>at fifty-eight per cent of the engineers'.
</p>
<p>The third paragraph of this circular letter says : "At
</p>
<p>present we have one rate of pay for engineers just
</p>
<p>promoted from firemen, which continues one year.
</p>
<p>In the second year of service as engineer an advance
</p>
<p>in pay is given. On the expiration of the second
</p>
<p>year a further advance to full pay is given. The
</p>
<p>schedule proposed by the engineers' committee does
</p>
<p>away with this classification and insists upon full pav
</p>
<p>11^
</p>
<p>154 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>for every man as soon as he runs an engine." No, Sir!
</p>
<p>Not full pay for every man as soon as he runs an
</p>
<p>engine, but full pay as soon as the Burlington com-
</p>
<p>pany puts him forward as a capable and safe man to
</p>
<p>be entrusted with a train valuable in property and life.
</p>
<p>If fully trusted to do the most difficult work, why not
</p>
<p>full pay ? That is a question often asked, but never
</p>
<p>yet answered. If an answer had been within the ho-
</p>
<p>rizon when this circular was indited, the powerful im-
</p>
<p>agination of its authors would have brought it in. Ca-
</p>
<p>pable and safe, means perfect, and if he is that, why de-
</p>
<p>grade him in his pay ?
</p>
<p>"The classification arranging for lower pay for be-
</p>
<p>ginners is in force in other branches of service. There
</p>
<p>is no complaint about this system from any of the C,
</p>
<p>B. & Q. employes, except engineers. There seems to
</p>
<p>be no explanation offered that the classification of
</p>
<p>which you complain is not as applicable to the en-
</p>
<p>ginemen as to other employes."
</p>
<p>The fact that brakemen and conductors work for
</p>
<p>their first six months at less than full rate, is not prop-
</p>
<p>erly classification ; it is an apprenticeship to which no
</p>
<p>class of laborers would object for a moment. To com-
</p>
<p>pare the probationary work of the engineers with that
</p>
<p>of brakemen and conductors and call them similar, as
</p>
<p>does the circular letter, is not only ridiculous to those
</p>
<p>who know better, but it is misleading to those who do
</p>
<p>not. It shows the want of candor in the writer, and
</p>
<p>of equity in their cause. It is a mode of attempting to
</p>
<p>make public sentiment, for which its authors must have
</p>
<p>felt ashamed in the dark for having committed treason

<p>against justice and logic. It makes the false issue that
</p>
<p>THE CIRCULAR LETTER ANSWERED. 1 55
</p>
<p>while engineers complain of classification for them-
</p>
<p>selves, they do not complain of it as to brakemen and
</p>
<p>conductors, while the fact is that classification as it has
</p>
<p>been forced upon engineers, has never been applied to
</p>
<p>brakemen and conductors and the authors of this cir-
</p>
<p>cular knew it.
</p>
<p>" To mass all engineers into one common body and
</p>
<p>pay all alike, taking no account of superior abil-
</p>
<p>ity or intelligence, seems to us unjust and unfair, and
</p>
<p>in direct opposition to the spirit of the times we live
</p>
<p>in, which tends to assure to each man whatever re-
</p>
<p>wards are due to his own abilities and skill, and not to
</p>
<p>produce caste, all members of which are on the same
</p>
<p>level."
</p>
<p>Let me quote from the Burlington schedule of pay,
</p>
<p>and show who creates caste, and whether ability is
</p>
<p>recognized and rewarded: "A passenger train be-
</p>
<p>tween Aurora and Galesburg, one hundred and twen-
</p>
<p>ty-five miles, pays :
</p>
<p>FIRST YEAR. SECOND YEAR. THIRD YEAR.
</p>
<p>Engineers, $2.75 $3.25 $3.75
</p>
<p>Firemen, 1.85 2.00 2.15
</p>
<p>Is it caste to say that one man doing an equal
</p>
<p>amount of work shall do it for one dollar less than an-
</p>
<p>other ? Is it rewarding ability ? Does he have the
</p>
<p>ability ? If not, why should the schedule quote a third-
</p>
<p>class man in first-class service ? The position is posi-
</p>
<p>tively inconsistent. If they are not equal to the ser-
</p>
<p>vice, they have no business in it; yet the schedule
</p>
<p>shows they are, and we know they are. The reason
</p>
<p>why there are not more third-class men running pas-

</p>
<p>that the oldest in the service shall have the prefer-

</p>
<p>The next clause in this letter is very valuable, as it
</p>
<p>outlines what the Burlington considers their rights
</p>
<p>and what the public demands. It says: "The com-
</p>
<p>pany must reserve absolutely the right to ascertain, by
</p>
<p>whatever examinations it may think advisable, wheth-
</p>
<p>er its employes of all classes are capable of fulfilling
</p>
<p>the duties they undertake, and the public also demand
</p>
<p>that the railroad company shall take every precaution
</p>
<p>to employ only those men who can safely perform the
</p>
<p>work entrusted to them." This is right unless the ex-
</p>
<p>amination is only meant to arrest and discharge old em-
</p>
<p>ployes, as was done in the color-blind test. In that
</p>
<p>matter, as all know who know anything about it, the
</p>
<p>men were tested with all the various and delicate
</p>
<p>shades of color so that an expert in colors would hard-
</p>
<p>ly pass. Our engineers of the first and second years
</p>
<p>held in regular work, but with inferior pay, have re-
</p>
<p>quested any, reasonable examination, but could not
</p>
<p>obtain it. The best of work was required for two
</p>
<p>years at degraded rates of pay, while steadily refusing
</p>
<p>a fair examination as to ability and skill with reference
</p>
<p>to promotion, and this by a company that is laboring
</p>
<p>to prevent others from creating caste. Now read the
</p>
<p>evidence taken before the Illinois and Iowa railroad
</p>
<p>commissioners concerning the kind of men which later
</p>
<p>took charge of the company's property, and its pat-
</p>
<p>rons' lives, without a particle of either qualification or
</p>
<p>examination, and the authors of this circular are "hoisted
</p>
<p>on their own petard." This letter closes with these

<p>time. The engineers on the Chicago & North Western

<p>railroad, for the same service, receive $120.00. No
</p>
<p>proof is necessary to show that men are not rewarded in
</p>
<p>accordance with merit and ability, which Mr. Stone says
</p>
<p>the spirit of the times demands. It is never ability on
</p>
<p>the Burlington, but time, that advances the engineer's
</p>
<p>pay. If the engineer just promoted has the ability,
</p>
<p>why should he be kept at reduced pay if it is ability
</p>
<p>that is to be rewarded ? And if the older engineers
</p>
<p>have ability equal to the North Western engineers,
</p>
<p>why should not this ability be recognized, and be paid
</p>
<p>as much ?
</p>
<p>These quotations prove that the Burlington pays
</p>
<p>less than its neighbors, and yet it is the best able to
</p>
<p>pay  or was at that time. It is easy to see that there was
</p>
<p>no intention to make a settlement. The officers had
</p>
<p>made up their minds to fight it out and win laurels for
</p>
<p>great generalship, not considering the interests of the
</p>
<p>" 10,000 stockholders in Illinois alone." 1 The Lon-
</p>
<p>don advertisement, in November, with its false repre-
</p>
<p>sentations, and the advertisements in New York,
</p>
<p>Pittsburg and Philadelphia, as early as the 26th of
</p>
<p>February, are ample proof of what was intended,
</p>
<p>so that all the negotiations were only a means of mak-
</p>
<p>ing time for the Burlington officials to be better pre-
</p>
<p>pared. Here is an event of the day before the strike :

<p>THE END OF NEGOTIATIONS.

<p>Grand Chief, P. M. Arthur, and Grand Master, F.

<p>P. Sargent, with a joint committee of engineers and
</p>
<p>firemen, were in Chicago on February 15, to meet an

<p>engagement with the officials of the Chicago & Alton
</p>
<p>railroad, on Friday, the 17th of February, 1888.
</p>
<p>This committee had presented a joint schedule, sim-
</p>
<p>ilar to that formulated by the Burlington committee,
</p>

<p>of consultation, their schedule was accepted and
</p>
<p>signed. It is rather strange that the Chicago & Alton
</p>
<p>found so little that was objectionable in this, and the
</p>
<p>Burlington found so much. While Messrs. Arthur
</p>
<p>and Sargent were in Chicago on this business, the
</p>
<p>Burlington committee advised with them in relation to
</p>
<p>their committee work, and were instructed by the two

<p>On the 17th, Chairman Hoge received a letter from

<p>General Manager Stone, appointing 10:00 a. m., Sat-

</p>
<p>ence, and the next three they were waiting for the
</p>
<p>Burlington officials to prepare their famous letter.
</p>
<p>On arriving at headquarters they met General Man-
</p>
<p>ager Stone, of the Illinois lines, General Manager
</p>
<p>Holdridge, of the Burlington & Missouri, and General
</p>
<p>Manager Merrill, of the Kansas City, St. Joseph & 
</p>
<p>Council Bluffs, and Hannibal & St. Joseph roads, and
</p>
<p>General Superintendent Besler. The only business of
</p>
<p>importance at this meeting was the presenting to the
</p>
<p>committee the carefully prepared document containing
</p>
<p>the schedules and rules of 1886 and 1888, as shown
</p>
<p>in chapter xxvn. They were asked to look it over
</p>
<p>and consider it. There was great skill in the prepa-
</p>
<p>ration of this document, and no doubt the officials
</p>
<p>would have been highly pleased if it had created a
</p>
<p>division in the ranks of the committee, for which no
</p>
<p>doubt they hoped. The committee accepted the cir-
</p>
<p>cular letter, and adjourned to meet at their own quar-
</p>
<p>ters, not that they expected to find anything in it to
</p>
<p>change their minds, but they could hardly do other-
</p>
<p>wise with reasonable civility. They saw in it time 
</p>
<p>the dragging along of the issue without meeting it.
</p>
<p>There is not much doubt that this document was in-
</p>
<p>tended to do demoralizing work in the committee, and
</p>
<p>if it should fail in this, then to use it, as they did use
</p>
<p>it, to bias public opinion. There was no evidence of a
</p>
<p>disposition to meet the men and discuss the points at
</p>
<p>issue; but every move by Mr. Stone called for time.
</p>
<p>Each day of delay brought a warmer sun, and drove

<p>the circular letter, and seeing no point in it where the
</p>
<p>company proposed any reform, they concluded to no-
</p>
<p>tify President Perkins that unless an audience was
</p>
<p>given the committee in three days, the men would stop
</p>
<p>work. A message was received from Mr. Stone at
</p>
<p>6: 00 p. m. saying he would meet the committee on the
</p>
<p>following Monday, February 20, at 3 : 00 p. m.
</p>
<p>On Monday the two chairmen, Messrs. Hoge and
</p>
<p>Murphy, were sent by the committee to see Mr. Stone
</p>
<p>and tell him they would limit the time to three days in
</p>
<p>which to sfive them due consideration. Chairman
</p>
<p>Hoge said Mr. Stone became very indignant, but told
</p>
<p>them he could not settle until he heard from Mr. Per-
</p>
<p>kins.
</p>
<p>On Tuesday, February 21, Mr. Stone sent word to
</p>
<p>the committee saying he would meet them, but that
</p>
<p>he had not heard from Mr. Perkins. Mr. Stone final-
</p>
<p>ly obtained the authority, and the committee met him
</p>
<p>on Wednesday, February 22, at 11:00 A. m. After
</p>
<p>the usual courtesy Mr. Stone opened the subject by
</p>
<p>making objections to some of the articles in the pro-
</p>
<p>posed rules. Mr. Stone did not seem to understand
</p>
<p>them as they were intended, and the chairman ex-
</p>
<p>nlained them. Mr. Stone said that if the committee
</p>
<p>had considered the matter and could see any certain
</p>
<p>article in the schedule in any different light he was
</p>
<p>ready to listen. The committee readily understood
</p>
<p>the import of this remark from w r ord and manner, and
</p>
<p>the chairman told Mr. Stone they were of the same
</p>
<p>mind as when they last met. Mr. Stone then said, "If
</p>
<p>that is the case we cannot make a settlement, as there

<p>are things in the schedule which I could not allow."
</p>
<p>164 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>No effort was made to discuss them separately, in an
</p>
<p>effort to come to an understanding, and the committee
</p>
<p>retired and sent for Messrs. Arthur and Sargent to
</p>
<p>come immediately, saying that they had done all in
</p>
<p>their power to come to some understanding and with-
</p>
<p>out result. These gentlemen arrived on an early
</p>
<p>morning train, February 23, met with joint committee
</p>
<p>and found that they had, in anticipation of the neces-
</p>
<p>sity, obtained the vote of the whole system on the
</p>
<p>subject of the controversy, and as the vote had been
</p>
<p>so unanimous for the committee to stand their ground
</p>
<p>until they had obtained some substantial concessions,
</p>
<p>nothing was left them but to proceed with the effort.
</p>
<p>At 10:00 a. m. the committee, headed by the lead-
</p>
<p>ing men of their respective orders, proceeded to the
</p>
<p>Burlington headquarters. On entering they found
</p>
<p>assembled Vice-President Peasly, General Manager
</p>
<p>Holdridge, General Manager Merrill, together with a
</p>
<p>large number of superintendents and master mechan-
</p>
<p>ics. After various introductions all were seated. Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone had not yet arrived. It must have been an
</p>
<p>auspicious moment to the mind of Mr. Stone. To
</p>
<p>have the superior authority of a great railroad, repre-
</p>
<p>senting as it does, "property aggregating over $192,-
</p>
<p>000,000; the interests of eleven thousand six hun-
</p>
<p>dred and sixty-eight stockholders," l and the employes
</p>
<p>of this vast holding; to have in his hands this vast
</p>
<p>power to be used for good or evil, was indeed a mo-
</p>
<p>mentous epoch in a man's life. The magnitude of
</p>
<p>this responsibility in the mind of a conscientious man
</p>
<p>must weigh heavily. But Mr. Stone weilded a power
</p>
<p>emanating from a Boston directory. "When slavery

</p>
<p>still wielded its lash, the merchants of Boston mobbed
</p>
<p>William Lloyd Garrison, and hissed Wendell Phillips,
</p>
<p>because they cared more for their trade with the
</p>
<p>south than for the poor slave." 1 Again, in this case,
</p>
<p>they cared more for money than for justice.
</p>
<p>A few moments after the committee were seated,
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone entered. An eye witness says: "His greet-
</p>
<p>ing was cordial, yet his every act showed that he was
</p>
<p>determined to make an obstinate fight, and that his
</p>
<p>answer would be, now, the same he had given to the
</p>
<p>committee at their previous meeting: "I give nothing."
</p>
<p>A few preliminary remarks were made by both Mr.
</p>
<p>Arthur and Mr. Sargent and the work was taken up
</p>
<p>for which they had assembled. Article i was read.
</p>
<p>This article was discussed for nearly two hours; prop-
</p>
<p>osition after proposition was made in an effort to meet
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone's objections, but he was not in a mood to be
</p>
<p>suited, and it was finally passed. The second article
</p>
<p>was taken up. This, like the first, did not suit Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone. Substitutes were offered, but, like the first
</p>
<p>one, no proposition met with his approval, and it also
</p>
<p>was passed. Then the meeting adjourned for dinner
</p>
<p>to meet at 2 :oo p. m. The two rules, which by no
</p>
<p>possible means could be made to suit Mr. Stone, are
</p>
<p>in force on nearly all the trunk lines in the country,
</p>
<p>and it was evident he did not wish to be suited.
</p>
<p>Promptly at 2 :oo p. m. the work was again taken up.
</p>
<p>Section 2 of Article 1 1 was read. This, like the other
</p>
<p>propositions, did not suit Mr. Stone. Mr. Arthur read
</p>
<p>rule after rule which had been adopted by other com-
</p>
<p>panies, but none suited. Finally, Mr. Stone made one
</p>
<p>himself. Mr. Arthur said, " We will accept that Mr.

</p>
<p>Stone." He replied, " I did not mean that to be ac-
</p>
<p>cepted; I want to consult with my associates." Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Managers Holdridge and Merrill recommended
</p>
<p>that it be accepted by the company; but Mr. Stone
</p>
<p>did not want his own proposition after he had made it,
</p>
<p>and it was finally passed without agreement or action.
</p>
<p>The real intention of Mr. Stone was evident in what
</p>
<p>followed.
</p>
<p>Section i of Article hi was read, which calls for the
</p>
<p>mileage basis for engineers, 3% cents on passenger
</p>
<p>and 4 cents per mile on freight trains, and Mr. Arthur
</p>
<p>said, "What do you say to that, Mr. Stone?" "I say,
</p>
<p>No, Sir, I will never concede it." Mr. Arthur said:
</p>
<p>" That is frank of you, Mr. Stone ; when a man says
</p>
<p>1 No, Sir, never,' some one will have to yield or there
</p>
<p>will be no settlement." Concessions were again
</p>
<p>attempted on Mr. Arthur's part, and rates were quoted
</p>
<p>from other roads. Mr. Arthur proceeded to show the
</p>
<p>number of roads that were paying the rates asked
</p>
<p>for by the committee. He showed where the Rock
</p>
<p>Island and Northwestern, running through the same
</p>
<p>region as that of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
</p>
<p>railroad, was paying more than was asked by the
</p>
<p>committee, and more than 90 per cent of the roads
</p>
<p>were paying what was asked. He read a clipping
</p>
<p>from a newspaper which stated that the Chicago, Bur-
</p>
<p>lington & Quincy had over a million dollars surplus on
</p>
<p>hand, and then asked Mr. Stone whether the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton was not able to pay as much as its neighbors ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone hesitated a moment, and answered, " That
</p>
<p>they might be able to do so, but that the basis on

<p>which thev paid their engineers and firemen was

</p>
<p>working satisfactorily to them, and they did not pro-
</p>
<p>pose to make any change."
</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur, having exhausted all known resources,
</p>
<p>and seeing that it was useless to waste more time with
</p>
<p>him, then said: "Very well, Mr. Stone, if you will
</p>
<p>not consider that proposition, if your men decide to
</p>
<p>quit work, I will sanction a strike on your road." The
</p>
<p>sanction of Messrs. Arthur and Sargent carried with it
</p>
<p>the support of all members of the Brotherhood of Lo-
</p>
<p>comotive Engineers and the Brotherhood of Locomo-
</p>
<p>tive Firemen. Neither could order, but they could
</p>
<p>advise and consent, and in the position of this joint
</p>
<p>committee, it meant a strike. It was evident from
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone's demeanor that he was prepared for the
</p>
<p>conflict, as he evinced no surprise when Mr. Arthur
</p>
<p>informed him what he might expect. The committee
</p>
<p>withdrew, and on their way to the hotel Messrs. Ar-
</p>
<p>thur and Sargent revolved in their minds what further
</p>
<p>could be done to obviate the disaster of a strike.
</p>
<p>They knew that Mr. Stone had been delegated full
</p>
<p>power to do as he pleased, but Mr. Arthur thought
</p>
<p>that if President Perkins, who was still in the east,
</p>
<p>knew the situation, he might intervene. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>Messrs. Arthur and Sargent formulated, and sent the
</p>
<p>following message:
</p>
<p>To President Perkins :
</p>
<p>"Unable to settle the grievances of your engineers
</p>
<p>and firemen with General Manager Stone, men are
</p>
<p>determined to strike. We want to prevent it. Will
</p>
<p>accept the same terms as made with the Chicago &
</p>
<p>Alton, and Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe; three and

</p>
<p>Answer quick! "
</p>
<p>No reply was made to this until Friday afternoon,
</p>
<p>February 24; then a message was received from
</p>
<p>President Perkins, stating that " he had given the au-
</p>
<p>thority to Mr. Stone to settle with the men. He said he
</p>
<p>was not familiar enough with the case to form an opin-
</p>
<p>ion, but he hoped the men would do nothing rash; that he
</p>
<p>would be in Chicago some time the next week." The
</p>
<p>coldness and the indifference embodied in the wording
</p>
<p>of this message, considering the importance of the oc-
</p>
<p>casion, is most un-American, and could only emanate
</p>
<p>from an autocrat in disposition. It showed utter indif-
</p>
<p>ference towards the men employed upon the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton system. The committee, together with their
</p>
<p>grand officers, had done all in their power to avoid a
</p>
<p>conhct, and there was nothing left them but a digni-
</p>
<p>fied m \intenance of their position, or to withdraw and
</p>
<p>leave th^ir future to the tender mercies of a power that
</p>
<p>had discharged the committee in 1883, and had de-
</p>
<p>manded of its employes a withdrawal from the
</p>
<p>Knights of Labor in 1886.
</p>
<p>Grand Chief Arthur reviewed the situation, and
</p>
<p>placed a strike before them in its worst possible form,
</p>
<p>showing what the result might be. Grand Master
</p>
<p>Sargent also pictured the possible future, telling them
</p>
<p>that " no sooner would the news go forth that there
</p>
<p>was a strike inaugurated than men would come by the
</p>
<p>score to take their places; that even men bearing the
</p>
<p>badges of their Order would come to take the places
</p>
<p>they would make vacant; that the company would use

<p>who had become incensed at the Brotherhood of Lo-
</p>
<p>comotive Engineers at something said or done, would
</p>
<p>take this opportunity to get revenge." ' This had no
</p>
<p>effect upon their determination to receive considera-
</p>
<p>tion from the company, or take the consequences,
</p>
<p>whatever they might be. Nothing was said by the
</p>
<p>grand officers to induce the men to strike, but they
</p>
<p>each told the committee that if they concluded to do
</p>
<p>so, the men w r ould be paid as their respective constitu-
</p>
<p>tions provided  $40 per month for three months, if the
</p>
<p>strike was not successful. If it was, they would get
</p>
<p>nothing; and that money would be raised to buv or
</p>
<p>hire, if possible, such men as were worthy. After
</p>
<p>mature deliberation they concluded to stop work, and
</p>
<p>the time was set for fouro'clock a. M.,Februarv 27. and
</p>
<p>the committee were instructed to go home and inform
</p>
<p>the men, and make all preparation for what seemed
</p>
<p>inevitable  a strike. Grand Chief Arthur's instruc-
</p>
<p>tions w r ere, unless otherwise notified: "When the ap-
</p>
<p>pointed time arrives, those who are at terminal points
</p>
<p>will quit, and those who are on the road with a train,
</p>
<p>will run the engines to the end of their trip, leave them
</p>
<p>in good order, go home and remain away from the
</p>
<p>company's property, and commit no lawlessness or
</p>
<p>overt act.'* 1 " If," he said, " we cannot win this strike
</p>
<p>honorably, we will acknowledge defeat." This ended
</p>
<p>the conference. Chairmen Hoge and Murphy re-
</p>
<p>mained in Chicago, and the rest of the committee de-
</p>
<p>parted to carry out their instructions.
</p>

<p>body, at 4:00 a. m., Februaiy 27. Mr. Stone said:
</p>
<p>"Forty per cent of the old men will stay with the com-
</p>
<p>pany." ' This estimate I have been credibly informed,
</p>
<p>came from the local officials' estimate of the men at
</p>
<p>each point along the line. It is hardly to be doubted
</p>
<p>that Mr. Stone was deceived, or misled by erroneous
</p>
<p>information, and had he known the true character
</p>
<p>of the situation, that instead of having forty per cent he
</p>
<p>would have none, that he must depend upon strange
</p>
<p>faces and unknown characters for success; he would
</p>
<p>not probably have felt such assurance, nor would he
</p>
<p>have given at this last meeting the answer he did.
</p>
<p>Had Mr. Stone shown any disposition, the conditions
</p>
<p>asked for could have been modified, peace would have
</p>
<p>been preserved and millions  not of Mr. Stone's
</p>
<p>money  but of the stockholders, saved. His disposition
</p>
<p>and intentions are very manifest in the following in-
</p>
<p>terrogation by a reporter:

<p>February 26.  "The spacious rooms occupied bv
</p>
<p>the general officers of the Chicago, Burlington &
</p>
<p>Quincy railroad company are generally vacated Sun-
</p>
<p>days. Yesterday was an exception to this rule. The
</p>
<p>leading officers of the company were at work at their
</p>
<p>desks, and hard at work. Several consultations were
</p>
<p>held during the day between General Manager H. B.

</p>
<p>were sent out to the various points liable to be directly

<p>affected by the strike; a half-dozen stenographers
</p>
<p>were kept busy with important correspondence."

<p>"General Manager Stone was closeted about 1 1 :3o
</p>
<p>o'clock with S. E. Hoge, of the engineers, and J. H.

<p>ten minutes, and when questioned upon what trans-

<p>pired Mr. Stone said: These men called upon me this

<p>them most emphatically, No. I informed them that we

<p>were willing to consider the question of wages, but
</p>
<p>did not care to talk about abolishing the system of
</p>
<p>classification. They then said that every engineer and
</p>
<p>fireman belonging to their respective organizations
</p>
<p>would strike at 4 o'clock tomorrow morning. That
</p>
<p>ended the interview" ' (It will be remembered by the
</p>
<p>reader that the mileage basis was what broke off the
</p>
<p>negotiations, and not classification.) "Did not Chief
</p>
<p>Arthur inform you Thursday that the men would
</p>
<p>strike unless their request was complied with!" "No,
</p>
<p>he did not; he said that he would give his consent to a
</p>
<p>strike. All the information we have had since then
</p>
<p>up to this forenoon was derived from the papers."
</p>
<p>"Is there any chance now of averting the strike?"
</p>
<p>"None whatever unless the men recede from their de-
</p>
<p>clared intention. We are making every preparation in
</p>
<p>our power to prepare for the worst." "
</p>
<p>When Messrs. Hoge and Murphy met Mr. Stone,
</p>
<p>and received his answer, "Most emphatically, No," the
</p>
<p>last act was performed, and the answer severed all dip-
</p>
<p>lomatic relations between these two powerful factors.

</p>
<p>body of 50,000 men, when they received the sanction
</p>
<p>of their grand officers, could not, with any dignity, re-
</p>
<p>cede without having any of their requests granted,
</p>
<p>when so many roads were giving all and even more
</p>
<p>than they were asking. It was left to be seen after
</p>
<p>the ultimatum had been given, whether radical meas-
</p>
<p>ures would bring about what peaceful negotiations had
</p>
<p>failed to effect.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur said: "It is the first instance where I
</p>
<p>have failed to effect a peaceable settlement of the griev-
</p>
<p>ances of our men with a railroad company. Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone absolutely refused to meet us on the mileage
</p>
<p>basis; he would not touch the wages question at all.
</p>
<p>I was willing to make all honorable concessions, and
</p>
<p>had already made some when he abruptly told me
</p>
<p>that he would listen to no proposition to treat on the
</p>
<p>mileage basis. This of course ended the negotiations.
</p>
<p>Why the Burlington people decline to entertain it, they
</p>
<p>alone can explain." In answer to the question of why
</p>
<p>they selected so early an hour, Mr. Arthur said: "We
</p>
<p>selected that hour because there are fewer trains on
</p>
<p>the road at that time, and we do not wish the travel-
</p>
<p>ing public to be inconvenienced any more than we can
</p>
<p>possibly help. Remember that this affair is none of
</p>
<p>our seeking and I regret exceedingly that Mr. Stone
</p>
<p>has forced us into it. It has always been our policy
</p>
<p>to avoid strife, and particularly strikes. What we ask
</p>
<p>is that we are entitled to the same consideration by the
</p>
<p>Burlington road that we have received from other
</p>
<p>roads." Grand Master Sargent said : "The die is cast
</p>
<p>and the public should understand that it is not a move

<p>fully prepared. There will be no intimidation, but we
</p>
<p>shall claim the right to buy any locomotive engineer
</p>
<p>that we please. We ma}'- decide to go to a locomotive

<p>engineer and hire him ourselves; no one can question
</p>
<p>us that privilege." "Mr. Stone admitted that few men
</p>
<p>could be pressed into the service from Chicago and
</p>
<p>based his hopes upon the smaller towns and cities
</p>
<p>along the road. He said an attempt will be made to
</p>
<p>press into the service the older and more experienced
</p>
<p>machine shop men. The company also expected con-
</p>
<p>siderable help from the firemen. There are hundreds
</p>
<p>of firemen, it is claimed, who are competent to run a
</p>
<p>locomotive engine, who would jump at the chance to
</p>
<p>secure a good job." '
</p>
<p>The Burlington management had said in their circu-
</p>
<p>lar letter that the public demanded that the railroad
</p>
<p>company should take every precaution to employ only
</p>
<p>those men who can safely perform the work entrusted
</p>
<p>to them. What a sudden change! They refused to
</p>
<p>modify the tests for fear they would employ some one
</p>
<p>not up to their standard. Then within a week, we find
</p>
<p>them groping in the dark, with a bid for all comers,
</p>
<p>without regard to kind or character, giving a glad
</p>
<p>welcome to the refuse from all other railroads, as well
</p>
<p>as from their own. Local committees were appointed
</p>
<p>by the general grievance committee men, at each
</p>
<p>point along the whole line, and they were instructed
</p>
<p>to enter the field on the principle enunciated by Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone in 1886  "supply and demand;" and to per-
</p>
<p>suade, if possible, or hire if necessary. That honor-
</p>
<p>able warfare was confined to the side of the striking men

<p>the following pages must convince the most sceptical.

<p>1 Interview with Tribune reporter, February 26, 1888
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXIX.
</p>
<p>THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>The difference between the Burlington managers
</p>
<p>and the engineers and firemen employed on the system
</p>
<p>was chiefly in this: that the enginemen asked for a
</p>
<p>change of the basis of wages from the trip to the mile-
</p>
<p>age ,plan, and the managers refused to make any
</p>
<p>change.
</p>
<p>The ultimatum was given on Feb. 22, 1888, leav-
</p>
<p>ing the Brotherhood the alternative of retreating from
</p>
<p>its position, or of endeavoring to enforce its request
</p>
<p>by a strike. The latter alternative was adopted by the
</p>
<p>two orders of engineers and firemen. The men of the
</p>
<p>grievance committee were instructed to return to their
</p>
<p>respective constituents along the line, and notify them
</p>
<p>that unless the managers had consented to treat with
</p>
<p>them before 4 o'clock a. m., Feb. 27, every man should
</p>
<p>leave his engine on arriving at its terminal point.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the managers were making preparations
</p>
<p>for the coming conflict. The enginemen hearing noth-
</p>
<p>ing from them at the appointed time vacated their pla-
</p>
<p>ces over the whole Burlington system, six thousand
</p>
<p>miles of road. Manager Stone said, "Only one man
</p>
<p>of the whole 2000 remained."
</p>
<p>The company was unusually active on Saturday
</p>
<p>and Sunday clearing the tracks and getting everything
</p>
<p>passible to its destination. The men were as obedient

</p>
<p>to order, and as careful of the company's interests as
</p>
<p>THE BURLINGTON STRIKE. 175
</p>
<p>though they expected to continue in its service. At
</p>
<p>four o'clock all engines at terminal points were run in-
</p>
<p>to their roundhouses and housed with the usual care.
</p>
<p>All trains on the road were run to the end of the divi-
</p>
<p>sion and left in good order. In fact the deportment of
</p>
<p>the old employes was unexceptionable. Evidently the
</p>
<p>men believed that their places could not be rilled.
</p>
<p>They did not dream that the great Chicago, Burling-
</p>
<p>ton & Quincy road, proud of its efficiency in every
</p>
<p>department, demanding high intellectual and moral
</p>
<p>qualifications of its employes, would disregard its own
</p>
<p>rule, held to be inflexible, under which no novice
</p>
<p>could run an engine.
</p>
<p>The officers of the road were astonished at the una-
</p>
<p>nimity of sentiment which they perceived in the men.
</p>
<p>So entire was it, that not half a dozen engineers and
</p>
<p>firemen were left in as many states and territories to
</p>
<p>serve the company. Two thousand men scattered
</p>
<p>over several thousand miles, united in giving up their
</p>
<p>honest and reputable employment, their good pros-
</p>
<p>pects, their certainty of home and friends, for princi-
</p>
<p>ple. They began the strike, not alone to secure better
</p>
<p>terms for themselves, but to give laboring men every-
</p>
<p>where a better chance,  a just share in the proceeds
</p>
<p>of capital. Their loyalty became a sublime spectacle
</p>
<p>when it was seen to be the trait of men vowed to
</p>
<p>practice, " Sobriety, truth, justice and morality."
</p>
<p>They believed that the contest on which they had en-
</p>
<p>tered would be no trifle, but they did not believe their
</p>
<p>opponents would be willing to destroy millions of oth-
</p>
<p>er people's property to gain a point.

</p>
<p>At four o'clock on the morning of Febuary 27, the
</p>
<p>176 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>officials of the road who had been in their offices all
</p>
<p>night, called in each man as his engine came in and urged
</p>
<p>him to stay with the company, but without success.
</p>
<p>All business came to a standstill. The few passen-
</p>
<p>ger trains on the road were abandoned by the men as
</p>
<p>soon as they came to the terminal point, where the
</p>
<p>engines were changed. It became necessary for super-
</p>
<p>intendents, master mechanics, road masters, fore-
</p>
<p>men in shops, machinists, anyone who could start and
</p>
<p>stop an engine to be ready to fill the vacated places.
</p>
<p>Danger to the property of stockholders or patrons did
</p>
<p>not deter the officials from entrusting such persons
</p>
<p>with the trains.
</p>
<p>At Chicago a few moments before four o'clock, the
</p>
<p>C, B. & Q. yards at Canal and Sixteenth street pre-
</p>
<p>sented their usual appearance. The early morning train
</p>
<p>had left on time, and the switch engineers were at
</p>
<p>work as usual. Just before four o'clock Train Master
</p>
<p>Pope issued an order that no trains should be moved
</p>
<p>west of Chicago. This was taken by the few train-
</p>
<p>men in the yards to mean that the company had se-
</p>
<p>cured no men worth mentioning, and that the road
</p>
<p>would be in a few moments practically tied up. Ex-
</p>
<p>actly at that moment the switch engineers stopped
</p>
<p>work and run their engines into the roundhouse and
</p>
<p>the strike was on.
</p>
<p>The first surburban train to come in was manned by
</p>
<p>Master Mechanic Smith with Superintendent Howland
</p>
<p>acting as fireman.
</p>
<p>The through passenger trains that were on the road
</p>
<p>were stopped at division points, and there being no

</p>
<p>from the west were left at Galesburg, and those from
</p>
<p>the Illinois Central managed to get to Aurora. "The
</p>
<p>fast mail being for the benefit of Uncle Sam, was not
</p>
<p>interfered with, and went as usual. No. 18, leaving
</p>
<p>Aurora at 6: 10 a. m. was taken to Chicago by T. S.
</p>
<p>Pope, the train master of Chicago. No. 20, at 7:15
</p>
<p>a. m., was taken in by F. M. Paris, master mechanic
</p>
<p>at Streator. No. 33, at 7:20 a. m., the milk train, by
</p>
<p>G. W. Rhodes, superintendent of motive power at
</p>
<p>Aurora. The Mendota passenger train was run by
</p>
<p>Dick Nixon, master mechanic, at Mendota." ' The
</p>
<p>Brotherhood's blow fell with paralyzing effect. At
</p>
<p>the Western avenue round house the most profound
</p>
<p>quiet prevailed. The round house was full of engines
</p>
<p>without steam. At 7 o'clock only one engine had left,
</p>
<p>and that was for the stock yards which was not in-
</p>
<p>volved in the strike.
</p>
<p>The Burlington sent out the following circular:
</p>
<p>"It will probably be a week or more before this
</p>
<p>company will be able to receive freight from you, and
</p>
<p>it will therefore be advisable, and for the public inter-
</p>
<p>est, for you to deliver all freight consigned to us and
</p>
<p>destined to competitive points, to such other roads
</p>
<p>as in your judgment can most promptly take it to its
</p>
<p>destination. We shall also be obliged for a few davs
</p>
<p>to decline to receive freight for local points. But as
</p>
<p>soon as we are able you will be advised of our ability
</p>
<p>to handle freight."
</p>
<p>At noon six hundred freight handlers were laid off,
</p>
<p>and every freight office in the city belonging to the
</p>
<p>Burlington was shut down. "The great freight house,
</p>
<p>fronting on Canal street and south of Harrison, was

</p>
<p>deserted. There was no trace of the hundreds of trucks
</p>
<p>with their immense loads of outgoing freight, and each
</p>
<p>of the twenty receiving doors was adorned with the
</p>
<p>following sign : ' No freight will be received to-dav.
</p>
<p>Lot. Brown, Agent.' " '
</p>
<p>Out of fifty-four suburban trains run daily by the
</p>
<p>Burlington, only four were run, and on a canvas of the
</p>
<p>opinion of the patrons on one of these trains, it was
</p>
<p>found that nearly all were in sympathy with the engine-
</p>
<p>men, and were willing to put up with the inconvenience.
</p>
<p>They all seemed to think that the Burlington could pay
</p>
<p>by the mile as well as other roads. 2 The train that should
</p>
<p>have left Chicago at 10:15 a. m., did not get started
</p>
<p>until 3 : 00 p. m. At an evening visit to the Union depot
</p>
<p>in Chicago at night, as far as the Burlington was con-
</p>
<p>cerned, passenger traffic was decidedly blocked and
</p>
<p>solemn. Not a train left after six o'clock p. m. Pas-
</p>
<p>sengers holding tickets over that road were obliged to
</p>
<p>sit in the depot all night on the hard benches. A
</p>
<p>throng of applicants was at the company's office for
</p>
<p>the places vacated by the outgoing men, and fifty-
</p>
<p>three were reported as examined by eleven o'clock.
</p>
<p>The examination must have been very limited. Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone said when interrogated, " You see there are
</p>
<p>plenty of men ready for the places." When he was
</p>
<p>asked who they were, and where they came from ?
</p>
<p>he answered: "I don't know." 3
</p>
<p>At Aurora the shut down was complete, all opera-
</p>
<p>tions ceased by the hour set. Several trains came in
</p>
<p>just before the time, and each was quietly abandoned
</p>
<p>by the men. Nothing was stirring, and the com-
</p>
<p>pany's premises were silent and gloomy in the gray

<p>light of early dawn. Later in the morning could be
</p>
<p>seen a motley crowd about the company's grounds,
</p>
<p>made up of curious citizens, old employes, and the of-
</p>
<p>ficials of the road, the latter trying to grapple with the
</p>
<p>difficulties of the situation. The officials were appeal-
</p>
<p>ing to every man they thought could be induced to
</p>
<p>come up and fill the vacant places, and the old em-
</p>
<p>ployes were as watchful and persistent in trying to
</p>
<p>keep them away. The engine for the Chicago &
</p>
<p>Iowa, called the Chicago & Dubuque train, was run
</p>
<p>out of the roundhouse about 11:40 a. m., and Master
</p>
<p>Mechanic Morris was making a desperate effort to
</p>
<p>find some one to run the engine. The officers were
</p>
<p>just beginning to learn that the men were in earnest.
</p>
<p>The men told Mr. Morris and the train master that
</p>
<p>they could obtain an engineer and fireman upon appli-
</p>
<p>cation to the engineers' committee, but they spurned
</p>
<p>this offer, saying they would like to know who was
</p>
<p>running the Chicago & Iowa road  the Brotherhoods
</p>
<p>or the officers ? Failing to get any one to go, they
</p>
<p>finally sought the committee, who readily assigned an
</p>
<p>engineer and fireman, but they were enjoined not to
</p>
<p>take anything but mail cars. That seemed to be sat-
</p>
<p>isfactory, and the men went on the engine and started
</p>
<p>up. Seeing all the cars were still attached, the engi-
</p>
<p>neer stopped and told them they must cut off the
</p>
<p>coaches. This they made a show to do, and again
</p>
<p>gave a signal to go, and the engineer finding they had
</p>
<p>not cut them off, stopped again. At this the fireman
</p>
<p>got off and told Mr. Morris to fire the engine himself.
</p>
<p>They then gave a signal to back up into the } f ard, with

</p>
<p>the engineer saw this he got off the engine, leaving
</p>
<p>them with no alternative but for Master Mechanic
</p>
<p>Morris to go himself, which he did. ' The next train
</p>
<p>was number 2, due in Aurora at 6:45 a. m.. which
</p>
<p>arrived at 2 : 00 p. m., with A. O. Taylor in charge of
</p>
<p>engine. The engines were changed, and engine 403,
</p>
<p>manned by Mr. Fred Geyer, foreman of the machine
</p>
<p>shop, who had never handled an engine in his life, and
</p>
<p>Seth Parsons, a farmer from Piano, Illinois, acting as
</p>
<p>fireman. When Foreman Geyer backed the engine
</p>
<p>up to couple on the train, he could not control it, and
</p>
<p>ran into the train so hard that it ran back a car length,
</p>
<p>and it was composed of eleven cars. Geyer remarked
</p>
<p>then that he could build an engine better than he could
</p>
<p>run one. They finally got started with the train, and
</p>
<p>when seven or eight miles from Aurora, they got out
</p>
<p>of steam, caused by the farmer fireman filling the fire
</p>
<p>box with green coal. Geyer said he thought to run
</p>
<p>up and down the track would help make up steam, so
</p>
<p>they ran away from the train about half a mile east of
</p>
<p>the train, partly up grade, and in coming back Geyer
</p>
<p>lost control of the engine, which was going at a rapid
</p>
<p>rate and struck the train, telescoping the mail car, the
</p>
<p>whole tank and part of the engine going into it. Ex-
</p>
<p>pert Geyer was taken out of the side door of the mail
</p>
<p>car, cut, bleeding, nose broken, and badly injured
</p>
<p>otherwise. Farmer Parsons, the fireman, had his leg
</p>
<p>and collar bone broken, and is a cripple for life. One
</p>
<p>of the mail clerks was very badly injured and has
</p>
<p>never worked since. Geyer was confined to his
</p>
<p>house, and Farmer Parsons was at the city hospital

<p>A collision occurred at the Chicago, Milwaukee &
</p>
<p>St. Paul crossing. William H. Pierce, assistant engi-
</p>
<p>neer of tests in the C, B. & Q. shops at Aurora, upon
</p>
<p>learning of the strike, with several other young men,
</p>
<p>signed a letter to Mr. Rhodes, superintendent of mo-
</p>
<p>tive power, offering to go out in any position the com-
</p>
<p>pany should deem advisable, and Mr Pierce w r as de-
</p>
<p>tailed by the master mechanic at Aurora to go to Men-
</p>
<p>dota, 111., and take a train to Fulton, as engineer.
</p>
<p>Mr. Pierce had never run an engine ; never was exam-
</p>
<p>ined for one; was obliged to wear glasses to see and
</p>
<p>was quite deaf. However, regardless of all interests,
</p>
<p>and with an eye single to the defeat of the striking en-
</p>
<p>gineers, this man was assigned to pull a passenger
</p>
<p>train.
</p>
<p>He started at Mendota and things went fairly well
</p>
<p>until he arrived at the crossing of the Chicago, Mil-
</p>
<p>waukee & St. Paul railroad. Unfortunately, there
</p>
<p>was a train on that road just crossing the Burlington

<p>In the evidence before the Illinois rail^ad commis-
</p>
<p>l82 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>sioners appears the following evidence, Superintendent
</p>
<p>of Motive Power, G. W. Rhodes, being asked :
</p>
<p>"Do you know Mr. Pierce?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, Sir."
</p>
<p>" What is his business ? "
</p>
<p>" Mr. Pierce is assistant engineer of tests in our labo-
</p>
<p>ratory at Aurora."
</p>
<p>"Is he an engineer in the employ of the Burlington
</p>
<p>road now ? "
</p>
<p>" He is not an engineer."
</p>
<p>" Was he ever at any time an engineer in the employ
</p>
<p>of the Burlington road ? "
</p>
<p>" He was never examined as an engineer for the
</p>
<p>Burlington."
</p>
<p>''You say he was not ?"
</p>
<p>"No, Sir. He was not."
</p>
<p>" Did Mr. Pierce ever run a locomotive engine be-
</p>
<p>fore ?"
</p>
<p>"Mr. Pierce had handled a locomotive engine.
</p>
<p>Yes, Sir."
</p>
<p>"The question was, did he ever run a locomotive
</p>
<p>engine before. Please answer that."
</p>
<p>" I am not able to say whether he did or not."
</p>
<p>" Are you in the habit, when exercising your best
</p>
<p>judgment to select engineers, to put a man on the
</p>
<p>road to run a locomotive engine when you do not
</p>
<p>know whether he has ever run one before or not ? ''
</p>
<p>" In a case like this when our trains were "
</p>
<p>" In any case ? "
</p>
<p>" We do so. I would do so again."
</p>
<p>" When the lives of the public are in peril you will

<p>take a man without knowing whether he has ever
</p>
<p>THE BURLINGTON STRIKE. 183
</p>
<p>run an engine before or not, and put him in charge of
</p>
<p>an engine ? "
</p>
<p> No, Sir; Mr. Pierce's education and training jus-
</p>
<p>tified me in believing that he could handle the train
</p>
<p>properly."
</p>
<p>" Do you believe any technical education in the
</p>
<p>shop without practical experience fits a man to be
</p>
<p>placed in charge of an engine to which is attached a
</p>
<p>passenger train ?"
</p>
<p>" Properly guided by a pilot and conductor, I say
</p>
<p>so, decidedly."
</p>
<p>"You would do so at any time; if there had
</p>
<p>been no strike, you would select a man of that experi-
</p>
<p>ence, would you ? "
</p>
<p>" I would do that under the circumstances we
</p>
<p>were "
</p>
<p>" Only under emergencies! "
</p>
<p>"Yes', Sir."
</p>
<p>"You would not say, generally, it is a wise thing
</p>
<p>for a railroad to do, would you ? "
</p>
<p>" I would say under circumstances such as we were
</p>
<p>left in, it was a wise thing for us to do."
</p>
<p>What does the public think of this manifest indif-
</p>
<p>ference to any thing but " our " interest. The public in-
</p>
<p>terest must be subordinated to that of railroads, is the
</p>
<p>motto.
</p>
<p>At Galesburg, similar conditions could be seen.
</p>
<p>The passenger trains from the west stopped accord-
</p>
<p>ing to agreement. The engines were vacated by
</p>
<p>the men, and there were no enginemen ready,
</p>
<p>in spite of the strenuous efforts of the officers.

<p>The passenger waited seven hours, and finally got

</p>
<p>started with Conductor Dewey at the throttle. The
</p>
<p>next train following this was also a passenger train,
</p>
<p>pulled by mogul engine No. 135, manned by one
</p>
<p>Chapman, who had been delivering engines for the
</p>
<p>Baldwin locomotive works. When he got about two
</p>
<p>and a half miles east of Galesburg, he stopped and
</p>
<p>stood there for about an hour and a half, when
</p>
<p>Master Mechanic Colville took the switch engine and
</p>
<p>went to see what was the matter, and got him started
</p>
<p>again and they reached Buda about 4:30 p. m., using
</p>
<p>more than six hours in making a distance of forty-five
</p>
<p>miles. Here he gave up the train and put the engine
</p>
<p>in the round house where it remained for three days,
</p>
<p>said to have been burned. ' Zeb. Sammis was put on an
</p>
<p>engine pulling a passenger train between Galesburg
</p>
<p>and Quincy, so drunk he had to be helped on the en-
</p>
<p>gine. His son, W. C. Sammis, tried to persuade him
</p>
<p>not to go, and the officers of the company, Master Me-
</p>
<p>chanic Colville and James Lindsey, road master,
</p>
<p>laughed at him and called Marshall Ennis, who told
</p>
<p>the son to go away or he would run him in.

<p>THE rSRARY
</p>
<p>OF THE
</p>
<p>UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXX.
</p>
<p>THE STRIKE ALONG THE LINE.
</p>
<p>At Beardstown as early as February 24, before the
</p>
<p>committee got home, the master mechanic and super-
</p>
<p>intendent called the engineers all in to the master me-
</p>
<p>chanic's office and asked them what they intended to
</p>
<p>do. The men being still in ignorance of what had
</p>
<p>happened in Chicago, they asked the superintendent
</p>
<p>what he meant, and he answered : "Don't you know that
</p>
<p>we are on the eve of a big strike ? " and then pro-
</p>
<p>duced the famous circular letter and tried its influence
</p>
<p>on them, but their only answer was, " We have no-
</p>
<p>thing to say. We sent a man to Chicago to attend to
</p>
<p>our business, and whatever he did, we propose to
</p>
<p>stand by." This effort evidently did not prove very
</p>
<p>satisfactory, yet it furnishes further proof of the com-
</p>
<p>pany's intentions. Business moved on as usual until
</p>
<p>Sunday, February 26, when Master Mechanic Wallis
</p>
<p>sent for the committee representing the engineers and
</p>
<p>firemen, Messrs. Wheatley and Sherman, and he
</p>
<p>wanted to know if they would furnish an engineer and
</p>
<p>firemen for the mail trains, and he was answered : " Cer-
</p>
<p>tainly, if a government officer requests it; but will only
</p>
<p>pull mail cars, no coaches." Then Master Mechanic
</p>
<p>Wallis and Superintendent L. E. Johnson sent for the
</p>
<p>chief engineer of Division 127, P. J. Murrin. These
</p>
<p>officers told him they would appoint him traveling en-
</p>
<p>gineer, creating the office for that purpose, and it soon

<p>1 86 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>became evident that the officers thought by capturing
</p>
<p>the presumed leader they would break up the solidity
</p>
<p>of the men, but they were mistaken. When the hour
</p>
<p>came all business ceased, and on the morning of the
</p>
<p>27th, they called every engineer and fireman to go,
</p>
<p>but all refused, and about 7 :30 o'clock a. m., they got
</p>
<p>a machinist to run the engine, with the new traveling
</p>
<p>engineer to pilot and to educate. This train was for
</p>
<p>Rock Island. In their dire necessity, they took into
</p>
<p>their family one W. K Hollis. This man was in the
</p>
<p>employ of the company before at East St. Louis, as
</p>
<p>foreman, and General Manager Stone declared in 1886
</p>
<p>that he was a thief, and that he stole coal by the car-
</p>
<p>load and forged time checks. What a fall was there
</p>
<p>in a day, when the great C, B. & Q. takes back into
</p>
<p>its service the false, the disreputable and dishonest,
</p>
<p>recently branded as thief and drunkard !
</p>
<p>At Beardstown, as elsewhere, all officers were
</p>
<p>brought into service. The shop foremen at Rock
</p>
<p>Island, East St. Louis, Monmouth, and other plac-
</p>
<p>es, taking a new role with a bound. At East St. Louis,
</p>
<p>about forty engineers and firemen notified the officers
</p>
<p>that thev would not resume their places on the en-
</p>
<p>gines of the C, B. & Q., at the same time telling
</p>
<p>them that no opposition would be made to men filling
</p>
<p>their places, nor would there be any obstacles to the
</p>
<p>movement of trains. However, the company secured
</p>
<p>Sergeant Langley with three policemen, to guard their
</p>
<p>property. The men on duty in the yard at East St.
</p>
<p>Louis began at midnight to make preparations to
</p>
<p>abandon their engines, and as there was little doing,

</p>
<p>several of the engines that ought to have been in the
</p>
<p>THE STRIKE ALONG THE LINE. 1 87
</p>
<p>yard, were run into the roundhouse and deserted, and
</p>
<p>at four o'clock the shut down was complete. At Keo-
</p>
<p>kuk not a pound of freight was handled, and every
</p>
<p>engineer and fireman quit his post, and the St. Louis,
</p>
<p>Keokuk & Northwestern was tied up, with the ex-
</p>
<p>ception of a passenger train which started from St.
</p>
<p>Peters, with a fireman named Burns, as engineer.
</p>
<p>On the morning of February 27, the bulletin board
</p>
<p>at Creston, Iowa, contained the following: "Owing to
</p>
<p>the strike of the engineers and firemen, and consequent
</p>
<p>abandonment of all freight trains, this company will
</p>
<p>refuse to receive freight of any kind until further no-
</p>
<p>tice." The official energy on the whole Burlington
</p>
<p>system was centered on the effort to man the passen-
</p>
<p>ger trains. The first train to move was passenger
</p>
<p>No. 15, which went west, piloted by Traveling Engi-
</p>
<p>neer George Brown, engine No. 295, with Ernest
</p>
<p>Fritse, engineer, and Ernest Higgins, fireman, with
</p>
<p>two extra men in reserve. Train No. 61, south bound
</p>
<p>passenger, which should have gone out at 4:20 A. M.,
</p>
<p>pulled out at 9: 00, with ex-fireman J. C. Shoemaker
</p>
<p>as engineer, and Brown as fireman. No obstacles
</p>
<p>were placed in the w r ay of any man who desired to
</p>
<p>work, and the enginemen said no force would be used
</p>
<p>or countenanced. All honorable means were employed
</p>
<p>to persuade the new men to stand with the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood, and they were empowered to hire them so to
</p>
<p>do. Passenger No. 8 was abandoned, and passenger
</p>
<p>No. 4 came in about 2 : 50 p. m. with only the mail
</p>
<p>cars, and the Brotherhood furnished Wm. Vangent to
</p>
<p>take them to Ottumwa. The coaches which should

</p>
<p>section and arrived at 4:30 p. m., with the engine
</p>
<p>manned by Conductor A. K. Stone, and Ed. Sheridan
</p>
<p>firing. Train No. 7 came in at 5 : 00 with only the
</p>
<p>mail cars, with Will and Chas. Flint as engineer and
</p>
<p>fireman, both Brotherhood men furnished on account
</p>
<p>of the mail. At the rear of No. 7 was attached Sup-
</p>
<p>erintendent Brown's special car No. 50. On arrival
</p>
<p>at the station, Superintendent Brown entered the cab
</p>
<p>of the engine that was to pull No. 4, which had been
</p>
<p>deserted by the Brotherhood men, his car being
</p>
<p>placed in the rear of No. 4. A great crowd had
</p>
<p>gathered at the depot, and as Superintendent Brown
</p>
<p>pulled the throttle out, the condensed water from the
</p>
<p>cylinders and dry pipe went out through the stack,
</p>
<p>carrying with it all the soot and dirt and splashed over
</p>
<p>the bystanders, and the pounding and sputtering of the
</p>
<p>engine was great fun for the boys. Train No. 7
</p>
<p>which arrived at five o'clock, did not get started until 6
</p>
<p>p. m., when it left with Conductor Lon Stroud at the
</p>
<p>throttle. The next passenger came in about 8:20 p.
</p>
<p>m., with Mike Johnson, an ex-bartender of Ottumwa, as
</p>
<p>engineer. This train stood in the yard for two hours
</p>
<p>and finally was pulled out by Conductor Will Patten,
</p>
<p>with engine 210. No. 5 passenger came in on the
</p>
<p>morning of the 28th, with an ex-brakeman named
</p>
<p>Burnham running the engine, and two middle division
</p>
<p>conductors, Frank and Cloyd, firing for him. The
</p>
<p>effect of the strike at Quincy was disastrous to its
</p>
<p>business interests, it being practically cut off from
</p>
<p>railroad travel and traffic, except by the Wabash, and
</p>
<p>the Quincy Missouri and Pacific, which was through

<p>the northern countries of Missouri, and these roads

</p>
<p>were seriously affected, because the switching at this
</p>
<p>point was done by the Burlington engines. The sys-
</p>
<p>tem there embraced the main line, viz : Galesburo- to
</p>
<p>Chicago, the Hannibal & St. Joseph, the Carthage
</p>
<p>branch, the St. Louis, Keokuk & Northwestern, and
</p>
<p>the Louisiana line. A desperate effort was made by
</p>
<p>the officers to get passenger trains through, the freight
</p>
<p>business, as at other points, receiving no attention.
</p>
<p>At Brookfield, the headquarters of the Hannibal & St.
</p>
<p>Joseph railroad, the superintendent's office was kept
</p>
<p>open all night, and each crew of engineer and fireman
</p>
<p>as they arrived, were called into the office and asked
</p>
<p>whether they would stay with the company, and all
</p>
<p>but one gave the same answer, whether they were
</p>
<p>members of either organization or not. One lone
</p>
<p>man, Win. Hannum, had evidently entered into some
</p>
<p>contract, and on the morning of the 27th, he, with
</p>
<p>some other firemen, came into the hall occupied by
</p>
<p>the engineers and firemen and said: " He hoped God
</p>
<p>would paralyze his right arm if he ran an engine in
</p>
<p>the strike. The men did not believe him to be sin-
</p>
<p>cere, and they followed him to the depot and he ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged he was going, giving as a reason that he
</p>
<p>was in debt. The firemen offered to pay his debts,
</p>
<p>but to no purpose ; he was willing to perjure himself
</p>
<p>before God and forsake his friends for the sake of
</p>
<p>getting an engine to run. He was a fireman, but not
</p>
<p>a member of that organization. He was the only man
</p>
<p>thev obtained and he went out as engineer on the next
</p>
<p>fast passenger train. Superintendent Crance and

</p>
<p>son of Hannibal, and Foreman Thompsdrt 4 - of ""Kansas
</p>
<p>City, did the work of engineers in the passenger train
</p>
<p>service. All officers, station agents, and some of the
</p>
<p>conductors, were searching in every direction for men ;
</p>
<p>men who had been discharged, no matter what for, or
</p>
<p>what their character was. The road master was even
</p>
<p>looking among his section men for capable men to be
</p>
<p>put on the locomotives.
</p>
<p>They agreed to give them protection and board
</p>
<p>them at some good hotel at the company's expense,
</p>
<p>during the strike. The officers, having watched the
</p>
<p>situation all night, and then during the day having to
</p>
<p>go on the engines themselves, were getting tired out
</p>
<p>and began to feel that they had got about to the end of
</p>
<p>their rope. About all the engineers and firemen on
</p>
<p>that road were located at Brookfield, and the officers
</p>
<p>found it a pretty hard matter to get an engineer or
</p>
<p>fireman to go out, for as fast as a new man would ap-
</p>
<p>pear the men would induce him to go up to their room
</p>
<p>and he was not likely to withstand the appeals of the
</p>
<p>strikers. The officers ran in about thirty section men
</p>
<p>of all sorts and paid them for coming, in an effort
</p>
<p>to tire out the vigilance of the old men, but they did
</p>
<p>not succeed in this, as the old men put them through
</p>
<p>an examination which few could stand without some
</p>
<p>knowledge of the business, and they would soon give
</p>
<p>themselves away. Master Mechanic Wilber went out
</p>
<p>on No. 15 and met engine No. 4 manned by Foreman

<p>Thompson from Kansas City, when they changed;

<p>ing Engineer, Horace Johnson, ran from Palmyra Junc-
</p>
<p>tion to Bucklin, where he met Superintendent S. E.
</p>
<p>Crance on No. 4, when they changed; Crance going
</p>
<p>back to Brookfield, and Johnson back to Palmyra
</p>
<p>Junction. No. 3 was without an engineer and there
</p>
<p>being no other road at Brookfield, the chances of hir-
</p>
<p>ing men at that point were very poor, owing to the
</p>
<p>incessant work of the old men to keep them away-
</p>
<p>On account of their inability to obtain men, their fast
</p>
<p>train had to be abandoned, and the officers finally con.
</p>
<p>eluded to run the engines through from Quincy to
</p>
<p>Kansas City, with two firemen and one engineer 
</p>
<p>226 miles.  In this way they thought they could keep
</p>
<p>the strikers from getting a chance to talk to them.
</p>
<p>Trains No. 5 and 6  Cameron to Kansas City  were
</p>
<p>abandoned, and also Nos. 61, 62 and 64  Cameron
</p>
<p>to Atchison. Foreman Frank Johnson at Atchison,
</p>
<p>a carpenter by trade, was urged to take the engine on
</p>
<p>No. 63, but refused. He had never been fireman or
</p>
<p>engineer, and knew nothing about one. No. 64 was

<p>finally got off with a switch engineer from the East

<p>Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia railroad, Mr. Shetla.
</p>
<p>At Kansas City, all the men quit at the appointed
</p>
<p>time and put their engines in the roundhouse in first-
</p>
<p>class order; the hostlers quit also. The first attempt
</p>
<p>to run was passenger train No. 4, with Foreman
</p>
<p>Thompson acting as engineer, who knew nothing
</p>
<p>whatever about running an engine. The regular fire-
</p>
<p>man refused to go, and a man was secured to go

<p>whom they called Cow Boy. He was dressed in cow
</p>
<p>boy style, with broad brimmed hat and belt. They final-

<p>arriving at Brookfield the cow boy was treated to
</p>
<p>some Sam Jones argument and the company lost his
</p>
<p>services. The first train into Kansas City came on the
</p>
<p>Kansas City, St. Joseph & Council Bluffs road, with
</p>
<p>the engine manned by one Dudley. A squad of police
</p>
<p>immediately surrounded the engineer, but there was
</p>
<p>a large crowd gathered, and Dudlev was greeted with:
</p>
<p>"Show your face!" "You will be afraid to face
</p>
<p>your own family !" etc., but no violence was offered.
</p>
<p>The Burlington advertised in the Kansas City papers : '
</p>
<p>" Wanted.  Competent engineers and firemen will be
</p>
<p>given permanent employment upon the lines of the
</p>
<p>Burlington system. Men entering our service will be
</p>
<p>paid full pay as per our schedule. We will give full
</p>
<p>protection and guarantee employment as long as they
</p>
<p>fulfill our requirements and prove competent. G. E.
</p>
<p>Fish, assistant superintendent of Hannibal, St. Joseph
</p>
<p>& Council Bluffs railroad." Mr. Fish evidently forgot
</p>
<p>that their company required three years' service to
</p>
<p>obtain these conditions of their old men, and Mr. Fish
</p>
<p>offers in this advertisement just what the men asked
</p>
<p>of the C, B. & Q. company; three and one-half cents
</p>
<p>per mile on passenger, and four cents per mile on
</p>
<p>freight. The Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific stopped
</p>
<p>the freight business of their road, which runs over the
</p>
<p>Burlington to Cameron Junction, because the latter was
</p>
<p>trying to get this freight handled by the Chicago, Rock
</p>
<p>Island & Pacific engines, by putting the cars in their
</p>
<p>trains. The Chicago, Kansas & Nebraska, also apart of
</p>
<p>the C, R. I. & P. system, when the men were asked
</p>
<p>not to run into a yard where scabs worked, tied up their
</p>
<p>road for about four hours. Finally the following dis-

<p>patch was received from P. M. Arthur: " Do not in-
</p>
<p>terfere with the Rock Island engineers and trains, so
</p>
<p>long as they maintain neutrality." l "Train No. 6, pas-
</p>
<p>senger, backed down to Union depot at five o'clock,
</p>
<p>an hour late, with an unknown man at the throttle,
</p>
<p>and the officials of the company said they did not
</p>
<p>know who he was. When it came to a stand-still, not
</p>
<p>less than three hundred people gathered around the
</p>
<p>engine, of all ages and classes. Several attempted to
</p>
<p>get into the cab but were driven back by the officers.
</p>
<p>Then they indulged in remarks at the expense of the
</p>
<p>engineer, a bearded old man who sat in the cab with
</p>
<p>the fortitude of a martyr. " What does he look
</p>
<p>like ? " shouted one. " Does his mother know he's
</p>
<p>out ? " " Look at his whiskers ! " said another.
</p>
<p>" Come down and show yourself, pap ! " " Let me
</p>
<p>have your photograph," etc. These and many similar
</p>
<p>remarks were made, and even the police had to laugh
</p>
<p>at the puns and good nature of the crowd." ! The Eli
</p>
<p>train was abandoned, and the Eli and No. 2 passenger
</p>
<p>were made one train, not having any one to run the
</p>
<p>engine for the fast train. The same motlev crowd of
</p>
<p>three hundred or mure were there to see the fun.
</p>
<p>The official report of this occurrence is as follows :
</p>
<p>"No. 2 delayed at Kansas City, caused by about three
</p>
<p>hundred men around engine before train was due to
</p>
<p>leave, putting links in guides of engine 18, blocking
</p>
<p>wheels, throwing rocks at engine cab and coaches;
</p>
<p>train will be delayed here a short time doing work on

<p>bear on city authorities, in getting them to furnish of-
</p>

<p>from hurting men who are willing to work." This is
</p>
<p>hardly just to the strikers, as there are none but
</p>
<p>switch engineers live in Kansas City, and there were
</p>
<p>but few road engineers there ; yet it is in direct line
</p>
<p>with the following from Superintendent Fish who
</p>
<p>says : " In fact, many men have been turned away.
</p>
<p>No engineers have been hired who have not had charge
</p>
<p>of an engine at least one year, and the same rule was
</p>
<p>adopted for firemen. This rule was adopted by the
</p>
<p>company to prevent its trains from being intrusted to
</p>
<p>incompetent men, and to insure the customary safety
</p>
<p>to the passengers." l It is a notorious fact that Mr.
</p>
<p>Fish was taking whoever offered themselves, as did the
</p>
<p>officers at all other points. At St. Joseph City at the
</p>
<p>appointed hour, every engineer and fireman quit their
</p>
<p>post  about two hundred. The Burlington has several
</p>
<p>lines here; Kansas City, St. Joseph & Council Bluffs;
</p>
<p>Hopkins branch; Villisca branch, etc. It looked like
</p>
<p>Sunday at the Union depot and around the freight
</p>
<p>yards. The B'. & M. Cannon Ball arrived on time,
</p>
<p>but was deserted by the engineer and fireman, and it
</p>
<p>was delayed two hours or more before it pulled out
</p>
<p>for Kansas City. No more trains arrived until 3:35
</p>
<p>p. m., when No. 2 pulled in from Omaha, with Master
</p>
<p>Mechanic Bridenstein, of Council Bluffs, on the engine.
</p>
<p>When No. 2 pulled in, a striker stepped forward to
</p>
<p>speak with Master Mechanic Bridenstein, but was
</p>
<p>promptly pushed aside by Joseph Hanson, superinten-
</p>
<p>dent of the Union depot. When Chief of Police
</p>
<p>Broaden said : " The man had a perfect right to speak

<p>to the engineer on business," and allowed him to do
</p>
<p>so. He wanted to pursuade Bridenstein to leave the

<p>engine. There was no loud talking among the strik-
</p>
<p>ers, but they were determined, and said that no vio-
</p>
<p>lence would be used in the matter, and if they could
</p>
<p>not win in a peaceable manner, they did not want to
</p>
<p>win at all. General Manager Merrill stated that the
</p>
<p>company would not give an inch, as the demands of
</p>
<p>the strikers were unjust. " Morning of February 28:
</p>
<p>the report says of the previous day : passenger train
</p>
<p>due at 7:00 a. m., arrived at 2:00 p. m., with a Rose-
</p>
<p>dale section foreman as engineer." ' This train was
</p>
<p>from Creston, and the engine was manned with Shoe-
</p>
<p>maker and Brown. 2 Conductor Lowridge said they
</p>
<p>reneged on him and the trip was continued with a
</p>
<p>section foreman from Rosedale as engineer, and brake-
</p>
<p>man Omer as fireman. Hannibal & St. Joseph No. 3
</p>
<p>came in with Shetla, Atchison dummy line engineer
</p>
<p>in charge, who was induced to leave the engine. Kan-
</p>
<p>sas City, St. Joseph & Council Bluff's train came in
</p>
<p>four hours late, with Pat. Brown, a fireman, as engi-
</p>
<p>neer. No. 1 went north with Master Mechanic Stei-
</p>
<p>ger, of the St Joseph & St. Louis road as engineer.
</p>
<p>No. 1 1 came in nearly on time, and the engineer and
</p>
<p>fireman were induced to leave the engine, and they
</p>
<p>joined the strikers; then the hostler of the roundhouse
</p>
<p>was sent for and took the train out, two hours late. 3

<p>Hayward, out of the calaboose, and they put him on a

<p>who never drew a cent of salary from any company

<p>ployed by the Burlington railroad put forth all their
</p>
<p>energies to save that company from defeat, and the
</p>
<p>company ought to be at least satisfied with their ser-
</p>
<p>vices. Their statements for the public were manufac-
</p>
<p>tured to suit the occasion, regardless of facts. "At
</p>
<p>Lincoln, about eighty trains, freight and passenger,
</p>
<p>depart daily over the Burlington system from this
</p>
<p>place. There are two hundred Burlington engineers
</p>
<p>and firemen who reside here." 1 "All these men quit,
</p>
<p>and the tie-up was complete from Chicago to Denver.
</p>
<p>The latter part of the day some trains were running,
</p>
<p>manned by conductors, train masters, dispatchers,
</p>
<p>master mechanics, and others who could be pressed
</p>
<p>into service, regardless of their fitness. One train,
</p>
<p>was got out of Nebraska City, the engine being in
</p>
<p>charge of Road Master Filbrick. No trains arrived.
</p>
<p>The Kansas City passsenger train got as far as Pacific
</p>
<p>Junction, and the engineer and fireman refused to go
</p>
<p>farther. They were using mule teams instead of
</p>
<p>switch engines to switch with. A desperate effort
</p>
<p>was made to run all passenger trains except the Eli.

<p>which was abandoned." 2

</p>
<p>were notified that the strike would take place at 4:00
</p>
<p>a. m. the 27th, and they made special effort to move

<p>eastward all the loaded coal cars for distribution

<p>along the line, in order that the people who depend

<p>upon the road for their fuel supply, might not suffer.

<p>CHAPTER XXXI.
</p>
<p>" MEN OF EXPERIENCE AND TRUSTWORTHY.
</p>
<p>We have considered the conditions now at most of
</p>
<p>the important points from Chicago to Denver. The sur-
</p>
<p>vey shows that the Burlington has succeeded, to some
</p>
<p>extent, in handling its passenger business, by putting
</p>
<p>into harness any man who would lend himself to help
</p>
<p>crush labor. Let us return as far as Creston, and see
</p>
<p>how much this company digressed from its own rules
</p>
<p>of highest practical requirements. In considering this
</p>
<p>question, we should remember that the C, B. & Q.
</p>
<p>company has required of their men from three to five
</p>
<p>years as firemen, and three years as engineers, to ob-
</p>
<p>tain that proficiency demanded by the Burlington sys-
</p>
<p>tem. At their general office at Chicago, a meeting of
</p>
<p>President Perkins, General Manager Stone, Paul
</p>
<p>Morton, and Chester M. Dawes of the legal depart-
</p>
<p>ment, decided toiencLout the following bulletin notice
</p>
<p>along the whole Burlington system: "Post immedi-
</p>
<p>i ately upon your bulletin boards, and in all conspicuous
</p>
<p>places, in and out of all depots in your division, the
</p>
<p>following notice : ' All engineers and firemen recently
</p>
<p>in the employ of this company, who do not apply for
</p>
<p>positions by noon of Wednesday, February 29, will
</p>
<p>be considered out of the company's service. Every
</p>
<p>man who has not applied by the above hour, can get
</p>
<p>all pay due him upon application to the master me-

<p>chanic of his division.' " This notice had no effect

</p>
<p>whatever upon the men at any point, unless it was to
</p>
<p>strengthen them in their determination to stand fast.
</p>
<p>In speaking of this, the Creston Advertiser said:
</p>
<p>" There was no undue commotion here, and it is hoped
</p>
<p>there will be none. The Brotherhoods realize that
</p>
<p>any rashness or violence on their part would be in a
</p>
<p>measure, fatal to their cause, and any inclination on
</p>
<p>the part of hot-heads or impulsive members, will be
</p>
<p>promptly suppressed by the thoughtful and conserva-
</p>
<p>tive men who are largely in the majority." Instead of
</p>
<p>going to any extremes, or doing anything unseeming-
</p>
<p>lv, they realized they were being introduced to a
</p>
<p>surprising kind of violence by the officers; violence
</p>
<p>against the rules under which they had been made to
</p>
<p>live, and that the officers were assigning any one to be
</p>
<p>engineer who would go. They then appointed a com-
</p>
<p>mittee to go to Des Moines and wait on Governor
</p>
<p>Larrabee, and lay the subject before him, and ask that
</p>
<p>none but competent men be allowed on passenger en-
</p>
<p>gines. 1 To meet this, Superintendent W. C. Brown,
</p>
<p>of the Iowa division, telegraphed the following in-
</p>
<p>structions to the general solicitor of the Burlington,
</p>
<p>who was then at the capital, watching the course of
</p>
<p>adverse railroad legislation :
</p>
<p>Burlington, Iowa, February 28, 1888.
</p>
<p>J. W. Blythe, Des Moines.
</p>
<p>" I understand that a committee of engineers from
</p>
<p>Creston have gone to Des Moines to petition the gov-
</p>
<p>ernor not to allow incompetent and irresponsible men
</p>
<p>on passenger engines. You may say to Governor
</p>
<p>Larrabee if you think best, that our passenger engines

<p>are being run by men of experience, perfectly trust-
</p>
<p>worthy and competent, and can give him a full assur-
</p>
<p>ance that no man will be put on passenger engines, or
</p>
<p>any other engine, except those possessing these quali-
</p>
<p>fications. We think we are better calculated to judge
</p>
<p>in regard to the character and ability of men we em-
</p>
<p>ploy, than the striking engineers, and we have cer-
</p>
<p>tainly a great deal more at stake."
</p>
<p>(Signed) W. C. Brown.
</p>
<p>The facts obtained from personal acquaintance of
</p>
<p>the men assigned, and from the evidence before the
</p>
<p>Iowa railroad commissioners, do not bear Mr. Brown
</p>
<p>out in this statement, but on the contrary, they place
</p>
<p>his statement in a very bad light. We will describe
</p>
<p>briefly here, the men referred to as being unqualified :
</p>
<p>" First comes A. K. Stone, who has been employed on
</p>
<p>the West Iowa division for several years as conductor.
</p>
<p>He has never had any experience whatever as a loco-
</p>
<p>motive engineer, and has acknowledged that he knew
</p>
<p>nothing of running an engine. L. H. Stroud, another
</p>
<p>conductor, has been pulling passenger trains, never
</p>
<p>having had any experience as an engineer. George
</p>
<p>Loughridge, C. A. Drake, Dempsey Ethridge, Dick
</p>
<p>Allen, John Erbert, Dan Hackett, and William Patten,
</p>
<p>all conductors of the Burlington, have been pulling
</p>
<p>passenger trains, and all of them have admitted that
</p>
<p>they know nothing of running a locomotive, and they
</p>
<p>are not reliable or efficient engineers. Mike Johnson,
</p>
<p>in charge of a passenger engine, was a bar tender at
</p>
<p>Ottumwa, and his experience consisted of a few months

<p>about six weeks as fireman; was given a passenger
</p>
<p>engine to run. Ed. Sheridan, also from a farm, was
</p>
<p>employed only a few weeks as fireman; was placed in
</p>
<p>charge of an engine on passenger trains, and is one of
</p>
<p>those efficient men of Mr. Brown's. Chas. McClel-
</p>
<p>land, a brakeman, had some experience as fireman, but
</p>
<p>was discharged two years before by the Burlington for
</p>
<p>incompetency, but has been considered equal to the oc-
</p>
<p>casion as an engineer. E.J. Sperry was a fireman for
</p>
<p>this company but was discharged for color blindness, but
</p>
<p>the officers having modified their conditions, he is ac-
</p>
<p>cepted as a competent engineer. Richard Price, whose
</p>
<p>only experience as a railroad man was a few months as
</p>
<p>brakeman, and with no other experience, owing to the
</p>
<p>scarcity of competent men, he passed muster. Chas.
</p>
<p>Connet, whose only experience was as a baggageman,
</p>
<p>was given a passenger engine, with the promise of a
</p>
<p>life job. Ed. Young, a yard master at Pacific Junction,
</p>
<p>run the yard engine and succeeded in getting it on the
</p>
<p>Kansas City railroad crossing, and not knowing how
</p>
<p>to handle air, could not get off from it, and the Kansas
</p>
<p>City passenger train came along, with Master Me-
</p>
<p>chanic Bridenstein at the throttle, and not stopping as
</p>
<p>he should for the crossing, ran into it, smashing up
</p>
<p>both engines. Bridenstein was arrested, but when
</p>
<p>trial came, by some magic, no one appeared against
</p>
<p>him and the case was dismissed." ! And now, what
</p>
<p>does the reader think of Superintendent Brown's let-
</p>
<p>ter, wherein he says : " You can tell Governor Larra-
</p>
<p>bee that our passenger engines are being run by men
</p>
<p>of experience, perfectly competent and trustworthy."

<p>202 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>before this, the Burlington required from three to five
</p>
<p>years as fireman, and then three years as an engineer
</p>
<p>before he became perfectly competent and reliable.
</p>
<p>They made the possession of this experience so impor-
</p>
<p>tant that no engineer's knowledge could be taken on
</p>
<p>testimony, but all men were required to go through
</p>
<p>these years of experience on the Burlington system.
</p>
<p>But now, if a man is willing to become the tool of this
</p>
<p>corporation,  one laboring man to grab at the throat
</p>
<p>of another  he is promised first-class place, regardless
</p>
<p>of his qualifications. He is even promised for the
</p>
<p>work of engineer, $4.00 per day and board, and for
</p>
<p>fireman, $2.25 per day and board, and Pinkerton pro-
</p>
<p>tection thrown in. This is a sudden change. It
</p>
<p>guarantees pay, and certifies as to qualification, both
</p>
<p>in advance. No further evidence is needed that classi-
</p>
<p>fication is not necessary, and is, as our men claim,
</p>
<p>wrong in principle. Every effort possible was made
</p>
<p>by the officials of the Burlington to bias public opinion,
</p>
<p>and the liberties taken with the truth were marvelous.

<p>WHO CAME.
</p>
<p>To return to Aurora: Division Master Mechanic
</p>
<p>Forsyth sent the following telegram to General Man-
</p>
<p>ager Stone: "The firemen and engineers have boycot-
</p>
<p>ted stores from selling our men provisions; can't get
</p>
<p>anything to eat. Have dining car sent. Can't you
</p>
<p>make arrangements to get us provisions from Chicago?"
</p>
<p>From the Aurora Express: "A big lie some-
</p>
<p>where, let us look for it.  An Express repre-
</p>
<p>sentative called on all the Main street provision stores,
</p>
<p>and showed them the above, and they said there was
</p>
<p>not a word of truth in it as far as they knew, and said
</p>
<p>it was an outrage to publish such a thing. He showed
</p>
<p>it to the leading members of the Brotherhood who
</p>
<p>said they had never thought of such a thing and did
</p>
<p>not believe Forsyth had sent it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Forsyth himself was next seen and when shown
</p>
<p>the dispatch said it was correct. A reporter, in fur-
</p>
<p>ther tracing the facts, discovered that the only foun-
</p>
<p>dation for the story is that Grampp, who keeps a sa-
</p>
<p>loon and hotel near the depot, had told two of the new
</p>
<p>men that he thought it was not to his interest to keep
</p>
<p>them." A concerted effort was made along the whole
</p>
<p>line to make it appear that an armed force was neces-
</p>
<p>sary to prevent the destruction of. property and loss of
</p>
<p>life, and thereby turn the tide of public opinion against

</p>
<p>evidence the fact that the conduct of the old men was
</p>
<p>beyond reproach and whatever hoodlum element there
</p>
<p>was afloat was brought in by the Burlington. The
</p>
<p>Chicago JVezvs ! said : "At the General offices this morn-
</p>
<p>ing the rush of applicants for positions was even great-
</p>
<p>er than yesterday. Not less than a hundred men
</p>
<p>crowded and hustled each other outside G. W.
</p>
<p>Rhodes' office. The crowd was of the same motley
</p>
<p>character as that of yesterday. Some of the men
</p>
<p>were respectable looking, well dressed fellows. Others
</p>
<p>were men of gray beards and venerable mein, whose
</p>
<p>only commendable qualities would appear to be that
</p>
<p>they were veterans at the business, if they were ever in it
</p>
<p>at all. There was another class, whose bearing, dress,
</p>
<p>and general deportment bespoke the genus Bum."
</p>
<p>"The false and sensational reports from Aurora,
</p>
<p>published in the Chicago daily papers, deserve the most
</p>
<p>severe denunciation. The strikers have been peace-
</p>
<p>able and orderly; have made no attempt to interfere
</p>
<p>violently with railroad traffic, and are numbered among
</p>
<p>our best citizens. But, while they enjoy the esteem of
</p>
<p>the public, there is on the other hand, no ground for
</p>
<p>the report that the people of Aurora are hostile to the
</p>
<p>Burlington road. Aurora deplores the strike because
</p>
<p>of its injurious effect upon the business of the city.
</p>
<p>We should be glad to see the difficulty speedily adjust-
</p>
<p>ed on the basis of mutual concessions and compromise
</p>
<p>to prevent further losses, not only to the community
</p>
<p>directly, but indirectly through losses suffered by the
</p>
<p>road, and the enginemen who are residents here." 2
</p>
<p>This is a fair sample of public opinion all along the
</p>
<p>line outside of Chicago, and it furnishes proof that the

</p>
<p>desire for selfish leadership characterizes the officials
</p>
<p>to a greater degree than the strikers. The utter dis-
</p>
<p>regard of gentlemanly dealing, and the violation of
</p>
<p>the rules of their own making, by the officials, became
</p>
<p>an aggravation to the men. The Burlington men
</p>
<p>passed from the strictest enforcement of discipline to
</p>
<p>an utter disregard of their own laws, so as to be able
</p>
<p>on one hand to take on unqualified and disreputable
</p>
<p>men, and on the other to make it impossible for their
</p>
<p>former employes to return. Their motto seemed to
</p>
<p>be : " We stoop to conquer."
</p>
<p>The engineers and firemen kept their halls open day
</p>
<p>and night. Every strange face that appeared on the
</p>
<p>scene secured their attention. If he was inclined to
</p>
<p>work for the Burlington, his manliness was appealed
</p>
<p>to, and if that appeal did not succeed he was hired if
</p>
<p>possible, and most of those who came first, came under
</p>
<p>a misconception of the situation and could be easily
</p>
<p>persuaded to go away and leave the battle to be fought
</p>
<p>by the interested parties. Many of these were given
</p>
<p>something for expenses, while others were void of prin-
</p>
<p>ciple and put a selling price on themselves, ranging
</p>
<p>from $10 to $50. Hundreds were in various ways
</p>
<p>persuaded to leave.
</p>
<p>The picture was filled with all phases of humanity,
</p>
<p>from the appearance of high respectability to the level
</p>
<p>of the gutter; Knight Templar, Knight of Pythias,
</p>
<p>Odd Fellow, B. of L. E., B. of L. F., G. A. R., K. of
</p>

<p>It was an astounding picture of human depravity.
</p>
<p>The legal and moral right of unobligated men to take
</p>
<p>the places made vacant was not questioned, yet when
</p>
<p>men had taken an obligation, solemn as a marriage
</p>
<p>vow, no man could take his brother's place, and retain
</p>
<p>his character. An occasional grain of gold however,
</p>
<p>was mixed with the dross. A letter was received at
</p>
<p>Brookfield, and enclosed was the following message :

<p>William Fulton, Chapin, 111.

<p>I do not know where he got my name, neither do I

<p>WHO CAME. 207
</p>
<p>It was a pleasant relief from the nauseating duty of
</p>
<p>appeal to honor, arid from the purchase of the souls
</p>
<p>and the bodies of men, to realize that hundreds who
</p>
<p>received offers of places from the company had, never-
</p>
<p>theless, sufficient integrity to practice the grand truth
</p>
<p>uttered by the Italian patriot, Mazzini : " It is around
</p>
<p>the standard of duty, rather than the standard of self-
</p>
<p>interest, that men must rally to win the rights of
</p>
<p>men."
</p>
<p>"Thousands of years ago, monarchs were everything,
</p>
<p>and the masses were nothing. Millions of men could
</p>
<p>be herded to fight the battles of a king, or to pile the
</p>
<p>pyramids which should be his tomb ; the lash was over
</p>
<p>them ; they could only obey. They might wail, it was
</p>
<p>nothing; they might die, there were other millions to
</p>
<p>take their places beneath the burdens and the lash." '
</p>
<p>And so it seemed then, as though the educational
</p>
<p>forces of the age had been inverted, and the bettering
</p>
<p>of the conditions of labor, through Mazzini's principles,
</p>
<p>was to be destroyed by the very element which cre-
</p>
<p>ated it. The striking enginemen were astonished at
</p>
<p>the number of persons who, blinded by greed and self-
</p>
<p>ishness, were willing to lend themselves to the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington monopoly, to violate all principles, and accept
</p>
<p>a place that was made possible only by the sacrifice of
</p>
<p>others.
</p>
<p>Many said they had come for bread, others for
</p>
<p>revenge. Every one had an excuse. I never met one
</p>
<p>who defended his action, because he thought the
</p>
<p>Burlington was in the right. The vigilance of the
</p>
<p>strikers, their presevering appeals, their money and
</p>
<p>their friends, made the situation anything but agreeable

<p>for the officers of the company. They were tired out
</p>
<p>trying to get the passenger trains over the road them-
</p>
<p>selves. They were hunting in every direction for
</p>
<p>some one who would lend their assistance. Letters
</p>
<p>and messages were sent to old employes who had
</p>
<p>been discharged for drunkenness; men were accepted
</p>
<p>without experience, from prison, from the gutter; yet
</p>
<p>the market was open on Mr. Stone's principle of sup-
</p>
<p>ply and demand. The persuasion of the strikers, and
</p>
<p>their money, were always diminishing the supplv. The
</p>
<p>officers said: "As fast as we get them, the gang
</p>
<p>(meaning the strikers) gets hold of them, and they are
</p>
<p>gone." There came a corner on the market of supply
</p>
<p>and demand.
</p>
<p>The company gained control of state and municipal
</p>
<p>authority to accomplish their purpose. Officers along
</p>
<p>the Burlington were notified by the managers, to see
</p>
<p>the sheriff, have shop men, carpenters, and others that
</p>
<p>could be used, sworn in as deputies, and to keep the
</p>
<p>strikers away, and to post notices of warning in all
</p>
<p>conspicuous places. Sheriffs, without regard to the
</p>
<p>necessity, readily responded. At Brookfield, one
</p>
<p>hundred and forty-seven men were sworn in as depu-
</p>
<p>ties Their character and fitness were not known by
</p>
<p>the sheriff, who is responsible for their acts. They
</p>
<p>were taken from a list of names furnished by the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington company. Not the slightest disturbance had
</p>
<p>occurred to create a necessity. The city marshal had
</p>
<p>not even been spoken to on the subject, and none
</p>
<p>existed so far as the public was aware. But the com-
</p>
<p>pany wanted a demonstration, for two reasons: " ist,

<p>to keep the strikers away, so they could not entice or

</p>
<p>people believe violence was threatened." Kansas
</p>
<p>City, St. Joseph and all the cities along the line, were
</p>
<p>appealed to to furnish a police force to guard the com-
</p>
<p>pany's property.
</p>
<p>The officers did not make any direct charge that
</p>
<p>the strikers were trying to destroy their property; yet
</p>
<p>whatever demonstration was made by them which had
</p>
<p>the appearance of guarding against violence, naturally
</p>
<p>reflected upon the old enginemen, in the minds of the
</p>
<p>public. Accordingly, the greater the demonstration
</p>
<p>the better for the company. " At Chicago a subur-
</p>
<p>ban train which stopped at the C. C. and I. C. cross-
</p>
<p>ing, was reported as having been boarded by four men,
</p>
<p>who got on the engine, said a few words to the engi-
</p>
<p>neer, and got off, and this crew reported that a coup-
</p>
<p>ling pin was put in the engine's guides for the purpose
</p>
<p>of breaking it down. There was no proof that it was
</p>
<p>the strikers. An old conductor who had been with
</p>
<p>the company for years, was on the engine, and knew
</p>
<p>none of them." " At 9: 30 a. M., as the preliminaries
</p>
<p>of starting were being arranged, half a dozen police
</p>
<p>officers kept jealous watch over the engine. No one
</p>
<p>was allowed to approach it except those in charge.
</p>
<p>The causei of this extra vigilance was due, it was
</p>
<p>claimed, to the attempt on the suburban train. How-
</p>
<p>ever, the half dozen or so who witnessed the depart-
</p>
<p>ure of the train, did not seem inclined to destroy
</p>
<p>things, and kept a respectful distance without the per-
</p>
<p>suasions of either fists or batons." '
</p>
<p>At 12:01 p. m. another train was started. " The
</p>
<p>engine was guarded by a squad of police as before,

</p>
<p>and no one was allowed within three yards of the en-
</p>
<p>gine. A small crowd witnessed the departure of the
</p>
<p>train, but no attempt was made to interfere with it in
</p>
<p>any way." " The crowd of applicants, so far, had
</p>
<p>been in no way interfered with or molested by the
</p>
<p>strikers, the latter having been, in fact, conspicuous
</p>
<p>by their absence from the precincts of the offices and
</p>
<p>depot ever since the strike was inaugurated," yet every
</p>
<p>demonstration of this character carried with it a
</p>
<p>supposition in the minds of the public that the neces-
</p>
<p>sity existed, and it was naturally laid at the doors of the
</p>
<p>strikers, and the greater the demonstration, the great-
</p>
<p>er the reflection. The laws of both engineers and
</p>
<p>firemen prohibit the molestation of property under
</p>
<p>penalty of expulsion. The weeding out process, the
</p>
<p>effect of their rules, would naturally leave men of
</p>
<p>character, and they were greatly annoyed to have it
</p>
<p>traduced by such demonstrations which later became
</p>
<p>monotonous, both in number and kind.
</p>
<p>We have said before, that whatever of the radical
</p>
<p>was found among the strikers later, was an outgrowth
</p>
<p>of the feeling that their character was being unjustlv
</p>
<p>traduced. The war of the rebellion produced a Booth;
</p>
<p>politics produced a Guiteau. It is simply impossible
</p>
<p>to have a strike like the Burlington, with one side all
</p>
<p>honor, every man living up to the standard of equity
</p>
<p>and good deportment, and every man on the other
</p>
<p>side a miserable fraud  the motto of one side : " Do as
</p>
<p>you would be done by;" the other: "Might makes
</p>
<p>right." It is a known fact that the two orders of

<p>engineers and firemen deprecated all acts in violation

</p>
<p>of vigilance, however, can dissever every evil element.
</p>
<p>The act of an individual, in violation of the principles
</p>
<p>of the institution of which he is a member, should
</p>
<p>not be charged as emanating from that institution, but
</p>
<p>he should be tried as an individual offender, and when
</p>
<p>convicted, if the society of which he is a member does
</p>
<p>not purge itself by expulsion or punishment, it can
</p>
<p>reasonably be charged as an accessory. But the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington's deputy sheriffs, Pinkerton bullies, with their
</p>
<p>repeating rifles and their court proceedings, menacing
</p>
<p>the interests of the public and usurping its powers, were
</p>
<p>meekly submitted to without protest. The public
</p>
<p>hardly seemed to notice the ready submission of sher-
</p>
<p>iffs, police, and courts to the will of a corporation.
</p>
<p>Nor was the public mind at all shocked at the viola-
</p>
<p>tion of moral principle in the Burlington's defence of
</p>
<p>its bums and drunkards, which had been gathered up
</p>
<p>to man their engines. Even reputable newspapers,

<p>which ought to be the channels of truthful information,
</p>
<p>and by means of which the public mind is educated,
</p>
<p>seemed to be as indifferent as a railroad official to
</p>
<p>either justice or truth. They were closed to the dis-
</p>
<p>cussion of the points at issue. I have been credibly
</p>
<p>informed that a leading newspaper charged as high as
</p>
<p>forty-five cents per line for space for the defense of the

<p>much assailed men. Some newspapers, just at the

<p>first, discussed the question of rights and the relation
</p>
<p>and duties of railroads to the public, but very soon

<p>Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad,
</p>
<p>Mr. E. J. Sidey, editor Commonwealth:
</p>
<p>Dear Sir :  If in unison with your views, give
</p>
<p>the company some nice editorials commenting on the
</p>
<p>strike. It occurs to me our citizens ought to shield
</p>
<p>the company as far as possible, as their interests
</p>
<p>are identical with our people. While our people
</p>
<p>give the company considerable cash in return, the
</p>
<p>company, through their different avenues, keep a vol-
</p>
<p>ume of money flowing through the arteries of Creston
</p>
<p>industries. In return will endeavor to get you value
</p>
<p>received, but do not turn the flag of truce on me in
</p>
<p>return." ' Very Truly,
</p>
<p>(Signed) G. W. Fogg.
</p>
<p>The allurements of such bate, so nice and tempting,
</p>
<p>no doubt led many editors to believe that the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton was in a bad way, and needed defending. Yet
</p>
<p>for all the influence used, there were some editors
</p>
<p>who stood for justice and discussed the question fear-
</p>
<p>lessly. It is a notable fact that most of these editors
</p>
<p>were personally acquainted with the striking engine-
</p>
<p>men and the circumstances surrounding them. The
</p>
<p>editor of the St. Joseph, Mo., Gazette was true to his

<p>he is guilty of willful hypocrisy."
</p>
<p>Such inferences carry with them in the mind of the
</p>
<p>reader  unacquainted with the character of the men
</p>
<p>alluded to  the idea of socialism, and other issues that
</p>
<p>are abhorrent to the honest laborer, and more so than
</p>
<p>to any other class. What class would do what the
</p>
<p>laborer did at Cleveland? "In the great parade on
</p>
<p>labor day at Cleveland a few anarchists scorning the
</p>
<p>flag of the union, hoisted the hated emblem of anar-
</p>
<p>chy. This insult to the glorious flag of the republic
</p>
<p>fired the loyal hearts of the patriotic sons of toil, and
</p>
<p>as a result the anarchists were most unceremoniously
</p>
<p>fired from the grounds with broken heads and bloody
</p>
<p>noses." Some of these papers seemed to express sur-
</p>
<p>prise that these laboring men should have been so
</p>
<p>prompt to resent an insult to the public. More loyal
</p>
<p>and patriotic hearts do not beat in America than those

<p>arms have made the republic what it is, and who in

</p>
<p>214 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>offered their blood for the cause they believed to be
</p>
<p>just?" 1 The Burlington strikers were as honest in
</p>
<p>their convictions, and were as ready with their sacrifices
</p>
<p>to maintain them, as were the men of 1861 to 1865.
</p>
<p>But the weight of all this pressure bore heavily upon
</p>
<p>these men, and as we look at it now, after the smoke
</p>
<p>of battle has cleared away, we wonder at the unanimi-
</p>
<p>ty with which they stood the test, and held steadfast.
</p>
<p>Very few were affected sufficiently to turn back to
</p>
<p>the company, which was no doubt greatly desired.
</p>
<p>I am reminded of one man  James Johnson, of Gales-
</p>
<p>burg, 111.,  who said " He did not expect to live long
</p>
<p>enough to live down the disgrace of being a C, B. &
</p>
<p>Q. striker." Such men as this have lived in all ages,
</p>
<p>and in all countries. They are the enemies of prog-
</p>
<p>ress. They are, however, always ready to accept
</p>
<p>the benefits earned by others, and this man no doubt,
</p>
<p>influenced partly by the newspapers, more by his in-
</p>
<p>ane greed, forgetful that his vote and voice had been
</p>
<p>joined with his brothers, turned his back upon them
</p>
<p>and honor, and joined that company better suited to
</p>
<p>his nature  " the scabs." To more fully show the one-
</p>
<p>sided character of the controversy as presented in the
</p>
<p>leading newspapers, we give in the next chapter, quo-
</p>
<p>tations from the Chicago Journals.

<p>CHAPTER XXXIII.
</p>
<p>PUBLIC OPINION MADE TO ORDER.
</p>
<p>The famous Creston letter is made the foundation
</p>
<p>for the following editorials on March 3:
</p>
<p>The Chicago Mail said: "The fact must not be
</p>
<p>overlooked that the striking engineers have assumed
</p>
<p>a grave responsibility, and that among those who will
</p>
<p>suffer, are thousands not interested in the fight be-
</p>
<p>tween the railroads and its employes. It is a serious
</p>
<p>thing to cripple business, to interfere with the move-
</p>
<p>ments of the traveling community, and possibly, in the
</p>
<p>end, to have caused violence and bloodshed. If the
</p>
<p>strike now on becomes otherwise than peaceable in
</p>
<p>any of its features, the public will not be tolerant. It
</p>
<p>requires a great deal of patience on the part of the
</p>
<p>community at any time to endure a strike where the
</p>
<p>crippled employer is a public servant, or the first evil
</p>
<p>effects in such a case are felt by the people at large.
</p>
<p>The present strike is of the sort referred to. It hurts
</p>
<p>the public at once, and seriously. The public will not
</p>
<p>submit to it if the fight is greatly prolonged. If, as in
</p>
<p>the great strike of 1877, there is violence from any
</p>
<p>source the sentiment of chafing endurance will change
</p>
<p>at once to one of earnest aggressiveness and some-
</p>
<p>body will be punished. It is well that those conduct-
</p>
<p>ing the warfare should bear the attitude of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple in mind."

<p>The Chicago Evening Journal said : " The un-

</p>
<p>biased and disinterested person who examines the exist-
</p>
<p>ing controversy between the Chicago, Burlington and
</p>
<p>Quincy railroad and its striking engineers and fire-
</p>
<p>men, will find it difficult to reach a conclusion justify-
</p>
<p>ing some of the demands of the strikers. Their re-
</p>
<p>quests are in some respects extraordinary and indefen-
</p>
<p>sible. How much the general public may be disposed
</p>
<p>to sympathize with the engineers, who as a class are
</p>
<p>intelligent, courageous, and self-sacrificing men, yet
</p>
<p>they cannot reasonably expect public support in un-
</p>
<p>reasonable demands. The sooner this entire contro-
</p>
<p>versy shall be submitted to intelligent arbitration, and
</p>
<p>adjusted upon a basis of reason and justice, the better
</p>
<p>for all concerned. Even if the demands of the engi-
</p>
<p>neers are worthy of favorable consideration, and the
</p>
<p>object of arbitration should be to ascertain and pass
</p>
<p>on the actual merits of the case, no time should be lost
</p>
<p>by either side to bring the unfortunate contest to a
</p>
<p>speedy termination by all rational and practical means
</p>
<p>in their power."
</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune said in an editorial article:

<p>"Taken in connection with the vital and fundamental

<p>inal programme ; as the reply of the railroad company,
</p>
<p>however, is dated only last Wednesday, this does not
</p>
<p>seem to be probable. If there has been no modifica-
</p>
<p>tion since Wednesday, we risk nothing in saying to
</p>
<p>the representatives of the Brotherhood, that whatever
</p>
<p>the issue of the strike may be they will not be sus-
</p>
<p>tained as to the justice of their course by public opin-
</p>
<p>ion. It will be said everywhere that they have attempt-
</p>
<p>ed to impose the intolerable despotism of an outside
</p>
<p>labor council upon the manager of this great property,
</p>
<p>going so far as to suggest interference with them in
</p>
<p>the discharge of legitimate and necessary duties. If
</p>
<p>the case is susceptible of no further explanation, the
</p>
<p>managers will be upheld by impartial men in resisting,
</p>
<p>by every means and all the resources at their com-
</p>
<p>mand, such a proposed invasion of their rights."
</p>
<p>The Chicago Daily News: "There can be no
</p>
<p>question that the system which recognizies a difference in
</p>
<p>ability of men and in the kind of service required of
</p>
<p>them is right, and that the demand which classes all
</p>
<p>members of the Brotherhood as of equal ability, and
</p>
<p>all kinds of service of equal value is wrong. In its
</p>
<p>application of its system to individual cases the com-
</p>
<p>pany may possibly be seriously at fault. In principle,
</p>
<p>however the system itself is fair and right. In view
</p>
<p>of its long and honorable career, it is a suprise and a
</p>
<p>disappointment to all true friends of organized labor to
</p>
<p>find the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers taking
</p>
<p>a position so inconsistent with all the prevailing con-
</p>
<p>ceptions of American manhood. It must abandon so

<p>dence of the American people."
</p>
<p>The Chicago Inter Ocean and Herald were conser-
</p>
<p>vative and just, but the Chicago Times said: "The
</p>
<p>last general strike of the Locomotive engineers in-
</p>
<p>flamed the nation to the verge of revolution. Scores
</p>
<p>of lives were wantonly sacrificed. The people were
</p>
<p>appalled by the sight of blood and fire, and Pittsburg
</p>
<p>paid an indemnification bill of $13,000,000 and even
</p>
<p>then was not fitly punished for the demagogical coun-
</p>
<p>tenance it lent to the lawless. The Brotherhood has
</p>
<p>"lived down" the responsibility for the calamity of ten
</p>
<p>vears ago. Chief Arthur has been commended for
</p>
<p>his sterling sense. The past has been forgotten and
</p>
<p>forgiven, and the heroic duties performed by the engi-
</p>
<p>neers have elicited, from all classes, unstinted admi-
</p>
<p>ration."
</p>
<p>"No great strike, after what has taken place, can
</p>
<p>bring anything but defeat, unless it shall invoke a uni-
</p>
<p>versal spirit of revolution, and the American people
</p>
<p>have given their final verdict against revolution and
</p>
<p>rebellion. Mr. Arthur says they have a right to
</p>
<p>stop work, and that they have no intention of interfer-
</p>
<p>ing with persons employed to take their places. He
</p>
<p>knows that the object of the strike would be negatived
</p>
<p>bv orderly withdrawal and non-resistance. . Such
</p>
<p>action would be equivalent to resignation. A strike
</p>
<p>means but one thing; to refuse to work and to make
</p>
<p>sure that nobody else is permitted to work in your
</p>
<p>place, and when Chief Arthur, or Chief Powderly, or
</p>
<p>chief anybody, inveighs against interference or vio-
</p>
<p>lence, or aids to the cause, he is guilty of willful hy-

</p>
<p>shall prove harmful to commerce, and shall invite dis-
</p>
<p>order and loss of life, the public will hold him and his

<p>co-adjutors to a strict accountability."
</p>
<p>The opinions of the Mail, Journal, and Tribune are
</p>
<p>no doubt the result of the seed sown by the Burlington
</p>
<p>circular letter. But that of the Times is a wonderful
</p>
<p>exhibition of bigotry and untruth, and if it was not
</p>
<p>written by some official of the Burlington, the writer
</p>
<p>must have had some inducement other than that of a
</p>
<p>desire to guide public opinion to the truth. The
</p>
<p>charge that the engineers were responsible for the
</p>
<p>Pittsburg strike and its consequences, and the allusion
</p>
<p>to the people of Pittsburg, was adding insult to un-
</p>
<p>truth. These lines from the Times betray an under-
</p>
<p>lving baseness and disregard for truth and fairness that
</p>
<p>is astounding, and after reading them, nothing in or
</p>
<p>about the paper should surprise us. The Chicago
</p>
<p>Herald, of July 24, 1889, had a column and a half of
</p>
<p>discussion of the character of the editor of the Times,
</p>
<p>J. J. West, not even sparing accusations of obtaining
</p>
<p>money by false representations and of bribe giving,
</p>
<p>and it is no wonder, if there is any foundation for such
</p>
<p>charges, that articles vituperative and malicious, writ-
</p>
<p>ten either for him or by him, should appear in his
</p>
<p>paper. Yet they were read, and exercised a power-
</p>
<p>ful influence in forming public opinion. They created
</p>
<p>difficulties, if not dissensions, among men in the inter-
</p>
<p>est of organized labor, weakening conservative men,
</p>
<p>and abating that heroic defence of their principles
</p>
<p>which is so essential to success.

<p>It is greatly to be regretted that the engineer's side

<p>It is a sad reflection upon the public educators of a

<p>great country, as our newspapers undoubtedly are for
</p>
<p>good or for evil, that they should become such violent

<p>partisans on one side, when the facts in the case were

<p>This high compliment was paid the engineers and

<p>says: "Our trouble dates from a few weeks after the

<p>228 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>appointment to the road of a new officer, that of Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Master Mechanic, Mr. Segley, who had not been
</p>
<p>here long before he decided that the engineers  to use
</p>
<p>his own language  " know to much." He seemed to
</p>
<p>think it very necessary for the interest of the com-
</p>
<p>pany to employ men who know less; and in order to
</p>
<p>bring this about, he commenced a system of petty
</p>
<p>annoyances. Mr. Segley, without giving any notice
</p>
<p>that the rules had been changed, under which the engi-
</p>
<p>neers and firemen of your road had been paid for
</p>
<p>years, made a new departure as to extra time. By
</p>
<p>the rules of the road, extra time was allowed in all
</p>
<p>cases, after a man had run over one hundred and thir-
</p>
<p>ty miles in twenty-four hours. An engineer on the
</p>
<p>western division ran his engine one hundred and
</p>
<p>eight}- miles within twenty-four hours, and Mr. Segley
</p>
<p>told the time-keeper not to allow the usual extra.
</p>
<p>W e had always been allowed live engines, to runs
</p>
<p>number i, 2, 3 and 8- on the western division. Mr.
</p>
<p>Segley decided that they must be run with four en-
</p>
<p>gines, and no pay for Sunday work. The men, on
</p>
<p>drawing their pay, found the time from four to six
</p>
<p>days short of the time that should have been allowed
</p>
<p>according to their agreement with the company. On
</p>
<p>the Air Line, engineers have had to run their engines
</p>
<p>thirteen times over the road  the distance is one hun-
</p>
<p>dred and twenty-three miles  within seven da}-s.
</p>
<p>The collision on the Air Line at Millersburg, be-
</p>

<p>which engineer Charles Dunewell was killed, was one

</p>
<p>of being completely used up, he would have to lose
</p>
<p>the time. We tried to have an interview with Mr.
</p>
<p>Segley but he would not listen to any "committee," or
</p>
<p>that he would not be questioned, and we found it
</p>
<p>impossible to induce him to give us a hearing. He
</p>
<p>would say, "If you do not like it, leave." Mr. Segley
</p>
<p>discharged four men from the service on the western
</p>
<p>division without giving any reason for it except that
</p>
<p>they were not wanted. No fault was found with them,
</p>
<p>neither was it pretended that any duty had been neg-
</p>
<p>lected, but that the falling off of business necessitated
</p>
<p>a reduction of staff. At the same time Mr. Rice of
</p>
<p>Chicago was, by the instructions of Mr. Segley, hiring
</p>
<p>men to till the places of these old and tried servants of
</p>
<p>the company. One of our engineers obtained a leave
</p>
<p>of absence for one day. It came to the ears of the
</p>
<p>master mechanic that he was doing it in order to try
</p>
<p>and lay our grievances before the higher officers of the
</p>
<p>road. His leave was recalled, and he was ordered to
</p>
<p>go out, which he refused to do, and he was discharged.
</p>
<p>Another engineer came into La Porte completely tired
</p>
<p>out. His engine had to go on through, and he was
</p>
<p>ordered to go on with her. He told the officer that he
</p>
<p>had fallen asleep twice before arriving at La Porte,
</p>
<p>although he had taken all the precaution possible to
</p>
<p>prevent it, not even allowing himself to sit down. It
</p>
<p>was still insisted that he should go. He said that he
</p>
<p>would not endanger the lives of the passengers, by
</p>
<p>running an engine while asleep, for the whole southern
</p>
<p>road, and positively refused to go out again until he
</p>
<p>had some sleep. He was immediately discharged.

<p>CHAPTER XXXV.
</p>
<p>THE MURDER OF GEORGE WATTS.
</p>
<p>George Watts, one of the striking- men, was the
</p>
<p>first engineer who fell directly by a murderous hand.
</p>
<p>There were too many irresponsible men suddenly
</p>
<p>raised to positions of influence, to little pinnacles of
</p>
<p>petty power, to make life safe about the depots and
</p>
<p>roundhouses. Accordingly the instructions from
</p>
<p>headquarters were, always to keep away from crowds,
</p>
<p>and from all assemblies of idle men. The words of
</p>
<p>Grand Chief Arthur were well remembered: "If we
</p>
<p>cannot win honorably let us submit to defeat." If
</p>
<p>violent partisans in a contest are clothed with the
</p>
<p>authority of policemen or deputy sheriffs, the public
</p>
<p>danger is not abated but increased. There are men
</p>
<p>who love the distinction of striking a fatal blow when
</p>
<p>they have a shadow of authority to hide behind.
</p>
<p>When such men, becoming murderers, are protected
</p>
<p>from punishment by citizens, or shielded by the courts,
</p>
<p>there is great cause for alarm as to the safety of both
</p>
<p>property and life. On the morning of Saturday, March
</p>
<p>3, 1SS8, just before daylight, the passenger train from
</p>
<p>Quincv, 111., pulled in to the depot at Brookfield, Mo.
</p>
<p>Granger was the name of the engineer and he was atr
</p>
<p>tended by a deputy sheriff named' George H. Bostick,
</p>
<p>who had been sworn in as stated in last chapter. George
</p>
<p>Watts was at the depot at that early hour to take the

</p>
<p>train for St. Joseph, where his mother resided. It
</p>
<p>THE MURDER OF GEORGE WATTS. 233
</p>
<p>was the custom with the striking engineers every-
</p>
<p>where, to induce other engineers on the same system,
</p>
<p>to join them. This had been done all along the line,
</p>
<p>and it had not been called in question anywhere, nor
</p>
<p>was it then. Young Watts stepped on the engine as
</p>
<p>it stopped at the platform, and entered into conversa-
</p>
<p>tion with the engineer. While he was thus occupied,
</p>
<p>the engine was uncoupled and driven some distance
</p>
<p>away from the train and platform. When the engine
</p>
<p>stopped, young Watts was driven off by the deputy
</p>
<p>sheriff, Bostick, and he started at once, with a quick
</p>
<p>step, back towards the platform, with his back to the
</p>
<p>engine and to those upon it. He had hardly taken a
</p>
<p>rapid step or two away, till Bostick called out to him
</p>
<p>to throw up his hands. Evidently, he could hardly
</p>
<p>believe his own ears that such words were uttered,
</p>
<p>but without stopping his walk he looked around, as if
</p>
<p>to see the cause of such an order, and with his
</p>
<p>right hand up he reached the attitude at which the
</p>
<p>fatal shot was fired, striking him in the right temple.
</p>
<p>He must have looked along the deliberately drawn
</p>
<p>pistol barrel, for at the moment of looking, the brave
</p>
<p>deputy fired, the ball cutting the right front of the hat
</p>
<p>band and piercing the brain. The employes present
</p>
<p>carried the bod}' into the baggage room.
</p>
<p>The news of the frightful tragedy spread rapidly.
</p>
<p>The chairman of the engineers and firemen at that
</p>
<p>point, went at once to the scene of the murder. Im-
</p>
<p>mediate preparation was made for an inquest, and for
</p>
<p>appropriate expression of the pent-up feelings of all
</p>
<p>who knew the facts.

<p>George had lived in St. Joseph, Mo., from his youth

<p>234 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>up. His mother was a widow, and from his boyhood,
</p>
<p>she had depended on George for her living. Nobly
</p>
<p>did he respond to her faith in him. From the time,
</p>
<p>when a little boy he blacked boots at the depot, he
</p>
<p>always carried his earnings to his mother. He did the
</p>
<p>same when he became a wiper in the roundhouse in
</p>
<p>St. Joseph. His mother was not his treasurer, but he
</p>
<p>earned money only for her, after scantily providing for
</p>
<p>his food and clothing. x\t an early age he became
</p>
<p>fireman on a switch engine, then he was the attentive
</p>
<p>fireman on a road engine with the writer of these lines
</p>
<p>for eighteen months, working in all weather and in all
</p>
<p>hours, when he was promoted to be engineer in Nov-
</p>
<p>ember, 1885, at the age of nineteen years. He was
</p>
<p>a cheerful, hopeful, happy spirited boy, loved most by
</p>
<p>those who knew him best, but chiefly by his mother,
</p>
<p>for whom he lived, and in whose smile he was the
</p>
<p>happiest.
</p>
<p>Why should a murderous weapon be turned on such
</p>
<p>a boy? No one who knew him will ever believe that
</p>
<p>any word, or look, or thought of his, warranted vio-
</p>
<p>lence in return. There are in the world great, strong,
</p>
<p>brutal men, who never lift a hand against an equal, but
</p>
<p>who will whip their wives and beat their children ; not
</p>
<p>for any ill-doing of the helpless ones, nor for any
</p>
<p>counterfeit manliness of their own, but to gratify the
</p>
<p>devil that is in them. And this they try to do in a way
</p>
<p>that will not expose them to the deserved punishment
</p>
<p>in return. They trust to the very gentleness which
</p>
<p>they outrage to escape prosecution. Once in a while
</p>

</p>
<p>Messages were sent in various directions, and among
</p>
<p>others, one to a friend in St. Joseph, to go to the house
</p>
<p>of George Watts' mother and tell her the terrible news.
</p>
<p>The resident, striking engineers carried the body of
</p>
<p>the murdered youth to the city hall, where a coroner's
</p>
<p>jury was impaneled to investigate the cause of his death.
</p>
<p>While these preparatory steps were being taken the
</p>
<p>following notice was printed and circulated in the city:
</p>
<p>To the Public:
</p>
<p>" The unfortunate shooting of George Watts
</p>
<p>need give the public no uneasiness, as far as the engi-
</p>
<p>neers are concerned. Vigilance, not violence, is our
</p>
<p>watchword."

<p>Committee.
</p>
<p>A meeting was called in the strikers' hall at ten
</p>
<p>o'clock, to which the acting mayor of the city, Hon.
</p>
<p>John Ford, was invited. He evidently expected to
</p>
<p>hear revengeful expressions, but he heard nothing but
</p>
<p>words of inexpressible grief, as when brothers speak of
</p>
<p>a brother untimely stricken down. Of the hundred or
</p>
<p>more brothers present, there were no threats or
</p>
<p>thought of revenge. Without exception, they were law
</p>
<p>abiding men, and whether wisely or not, they trusted
</p>
<p>that the law of impartial justice would be vindicated.

<p>A newspaper printed at Linneus, the county seat,
</p>
<p>to which the slayer of George had been taken, printed
</p>
<p>the following under date of March 3 :

<p>"The sheriff brought George H. Bostictc, who shot

</p>
<p>George Watts at Brookfield, to this place for safe
</p>
<p>keeping. A force of forty armed deputies has been
</p>
<p>sent from here to Brookheld to assist in preserving
</p>
<p>peace. The excitement there is high, and lynch law
</p>
<p>is talked of. The strikers and sympathizers are de-
</p>
<p>termined, and they feel outraged at this useless
</p>
<p>attack."
</p>
<p>No grosser injustice was ever done the good name
</p>
<p>of the city and the people who compose it, including
</p>
<p>the strikers. That they felt the shooting to be an out-
</p>
<p>rage, there is no question, but that 'lynch law was
</p>
<p>thought of, is a positive untruth, and none knew it
</p>
<p>better than the mayor of the city. This piece of news
</p>
<p>was widely circulated, and it cast such an unjust re-
</p>
<p>flection on the city that the mayor was urgently
</p>
<p>requested to deny it officially. This he w r ould not,
</p>
<p>and did not do. So potent is the interest of a great
</p>
<p>corporation to retard justice ! So readily does the
</p>
<p>highest municipal office lower its dignity, and offend
</p>
<p>its own law abiding citizens rather than risk offending
</p>
<p>a great railroad corporation !
</p>
<p>When the coroner's jury assembled at the citv hall,
</p>
<p>the railroad superintendent and the company's attorney
</p>
<p>met with them. The strikers, not seeing the necessity
</p>
<p>of this, then secured also a legal advisor. Immedi-
</p>
<p>ately strenuous objections were made to the presence
</p>
<p>of lawyers. A member of the jury, instead of limiting
</p>
<p>himself to finding the cause of death, and instead of
</p>
<p>listening to the evidence, argued the case as if he
</p>
<p>was Leviticus himself. The verdict of the jury accord-
</p>
<p>ed with the facts and requested the holding of George

</p>
<p>Preparations were then made bv the strikers for the
</p>
<p>last act of good will and brotherly love for their unfor-
</p>
<p>tunate comrade, George Watts. Superintendent S. E.
</p>
<p>Crance evidently felt the shooting to be a most unfor-
</p>
<p>tunate occurrence. He was kind and cordial in his
</p>
<p>offers of service. He tendered the free use of a coach
</p>
<p>for the bearers, including the relatives, to attend the
</p>
<p>funeral at St. Joseph. He also asked for and paid the
</p>
<p>undertaker's bill of upwards of $40. Mr. Crance had
</p>
<p>always, and deservedly, stood well with the men. On
</p>
<p>Sunday, March -4, the friends and the members of di-
</p>
<p>vision 79, of Brookrield, joined bv members of division
</p>
<p>107 and lodge 43 of St. Joseph, buried their friend and
</p>
<p>brother with affecting ceremonies. About one hun-
</p>
<p>dred engineers and firemen were in line, in regalia, led
</p>
<p>by Pryor's military band. The Ladies' Auxiliary
</p>
<p>Society attended in open carriages, presenting many
</p>
<p>beautiful floral emblems. A fine burial lot was pre-
</p>
<p>sented to the family. The entire community was pro-
</p>
<p>foundly moved.
</p>
<p>At the preliminary trial of Deputy Sheriff Bostick,
</p>
<p>before the justice, he testified in part:
</p>
<p>" I told him to put up his hands. He raised his right
</p>
<p>hand a little way, not higher than his shoulder, with
</p>
<p>his fingers partly shut, with 'his other hand in his over-
</p>
<p>coat pocket. I says, 'Put up the other one;' told him
</p>
<p>to do it twice. He still had his back on me. Just then
</p>
<p>I heard a noise to my left and back of me; turned my
</p>
<p>eyes that way; seen a man; heard a click to the south
</p>
<p>of me and back of me; turned my face a little bit that
</p>
<p>way; seen a man with a pistol in his hand, not more than

<p>eight or ten feet away from me. Just at that instant
</p>
<p>238 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>I felt somebody catch me by the right hand, which was
</p>
<p>down about my waist. Jerked it upward; as it went
</p>
<p>up the pistol went off. He (Watts) hung by my
</p>
<p>waist a second or two and then fell with his head to-
</p>
<p>ward the north, with his feet outside the rail,
</p>
<p>and towards the rail. As soon as I could see  for
</p>
<p>the flash blinded me a second  I looked for the man
</p>
<p>on the right of me and behind me. They were both
</p>
<p>running toward some box cars in a south-westerly
</p>
<p>direction. I stood for half a minute, then I starts and
</p>
<p>walks south in the shadow of some cars. Dewitt Boyd
</p>
<p>came to me; I gave myself up to him. We started
</p>
<p>towards the roundhouse, but I wanted him to take my
</p>
<p>pistol. He said he would rather not, or something to
</p>
<p>that way. We had not gone far when we met Bee-
</p>
<p>ler. (Mr. Beeler is chief train dispatcher.) He says
</p>
<p>who is this, or something that way. I says, is this
</p>
<p>you, Beeler ? He says yes. I says, there, take my
</p>
<p>pistol. I guess I have killed one of those little engi-
</p>
<p>neers. He says how ? I says, I was crowded, and
</p>
<p>had to do it in self-defense. He takes my pistol, and
</p>
<p>Bovd and I goes to the roundhouse. Boyd did not go
</p>
<p>all the way to the roundhouse with me. He told me
</p>
<p>to go and get on one of those engines,  No. 51, I be-
</p>
<p>lieve. He goes back some place, and gets the sheriff
</p>
<p>and brings him up, and turns me over to him. I be-
</p>
<p>lieve that is all, except what has been told. Here are
</p>
<p>the marks on my wrist where he caught me, (showing
</p>
<p>some scratches on his right wrist where the head of
</p>
<p>the radius makes a protuberance.)

<p>The reader will notice that he claims to Mr. Beeler
</p>
<p>THE MURDER OF GEORGE WATTS. 239
</p>
<p>that he did the shooting in self defense; when he had
</p>
<p>before described it as an accident. But it is not our
</p>
<p>business to try this case, but to show what was done to
</p>
<p>prevent the trial, and evidently done to prevent the
</p>
<p>conviction. The evidence above quoted was presented
</p>
<p>to the grand jury, and an indictment was found for
</p>
<p>murder in the first degree. Judge Burgess be-
</p>
<p>ing called away, had assigned an ex-judge to the
</p>
<p>bench in his absence, a man who was at this
</p>
<p>time attorney for the railroad company, and for
</p>
<p>the accused as well as being his bondsman, vet the
</p>
<p>verdict of the grand jury indicting his client was
</p>
<p>presented to him, or rather he accepted a position
</p>
<p>where he knew he must receive that verdict, as
</p>
<p>a judge, and decide the question as to admitting
</p>
<p>to bail, and then fix the amount. We do not cite
</p>
<p>this to cast any reflections, yet to the average
</p>
<p>person not familiar with the ways of the world, these
</p>
<p>evasions of trial predict acquittal of the prisoner, if not
</p>
<p>actual discharge; unwhipt of justice. The idea that
</p>
<p>men have of a judge is taken from the idea of impartial-
</p>
<p>ity and rectitude of the Supreme Being, who is just,
</p>
<p>and true, and righteous altogether. For a thousand
</p>
<p>years it has been the custom of courts, where the
</p>
<p>judge is at all a party or partisan, that he shall come
</p>
<p>down from the bench, and wash his hands of all de-
</p>
<p>cision for himself or for his client. It would seem
</p>
<p>hardly possible for one so encumbered to follow a di-
</p>
<p>rect line of justice, and it brings to mind with startling
</p>
<p>emphasis the "impartial" conditions demanded of
</p>
<p>a juror, and the conditions permissible in a judge.

<p>The bail was fixed at$3,ooo for appearance at court, to

</p>
<p>answer tne indictment. The prisoner, out on bail,
</p>
<p>went back to the Hannibal division of the Burlington,
</p>
<p>and took his place as an employe of the Burlington
</p>
<p>system. The case was docketed for a special term,
</p>
<p>then put off to the December term, when the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton's legal advisers came into court and said " not
</p>
<p>ready." The case was then continued to the June
</p>
<p>term of 1889, at the company's cost. At the June
</p>
<p>term, the first day of court, the case was called, and both
</p>
<p>sides answered " ready." The judge then continued
</p>
<p>the case for one week in order to give time to summon
</p>
<p>a special jury.
</p>
<p>When the trial day arrived it was found that three
</p>
<p>of the most important witnesses for the state
</p>
<p>were absent. Among them was Granger, the scab
</p>
<p>engineer, with whom George Watts was talking when
</p>
<p>driven off the engine. This man had said that Watts
</p>
<p>conducted himself like a gentleman, and if there ever
</p>
<p>was a murder committed that was one. Granger had
</p>
<p>been discharged but had not yet left Brookfield at the
</p>
<p>beginning of the term of court, but at trial day he was
</p>
<p>gone. It is said he was given transportation to Cali-
</p>
<p>fornia by the Burlington company; at all events he
</p>
<p>was missing when wanted, as were the other two who
</p>
<p>were employed by the company. But the superintend-
</p>
<p>ent, road master, chief train dispatcher, etc., of the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington were on hand ready for the trial. This neces-
</p>
<p>sitated the state calling for a continuance on account
</p>
<p>of absence of main witnesses. Then the trial was post-
</p>
<p>poned again to the December term, 1889. If the man
</p>
<p>is innocent why not let the law take its course, and free

<p>CHAPTER XXXVI.
</p>
<p>THE RAILWAY PROBLEM.
</p>
<p>When the power of wealth takes the place of fidel-
</p>
<p>ity to principle it is an unhappy omen for the majesty
</p>
<p>of the law, and the rights of the people. In the year
</p>
<p>1874, in a speech in the lower house of Congress, in
</p>
<p>discussing the railway problem, the lamented Presi-
</p>
<p>dent James A. Garfield said, in part:
</p>
<p>'We are so inyolyed in the eyents and moyements
</p>
<p>of society, that we do not stop to realize what is un-
</p>
<p>deniably true, that, during the last forty years, all mod-
</p>
<p>ern societies haye entered upon a period of change,
</p>
<p>more marked, more peryading, more radical, than any
</p>
<p>that has occurred during the last three hundred years.
</p>
<p>In saying this I do not forget our own political and
</p>
<p>military history, nor the French Reyolution of 1793.
</p>
<p>The changes now taking place haye been wrought,
</p>
<p>and are being wrought, mainly, almost wholly, by a
</p>
<p>single mechanical contriyance, the steam locomotive.
</p>
<p>Under the name of private corporations, organiza-
</p>
<p>tions have grown up, not for the perpetuation of a great
</p>
<p>charity, like a college or hospital; not to enable a com-
</p>
<p>pany of citizens more conveniently to carry on private
</p>
<p>industry; but a class of corporations, unknown to the
</p>
<p>early law writers, has arisen and to them have been
</p>
<p>committed the great power of the railroad and the
</p>
<p>telegraph, the great instruments by which modern com-

<p>munities live and have their beinof. Since the dawn
</p>
<p>THE RAILWAY PROBLEM. 243
</p>
<p>of history the great thoroughfares have belonged to
</p>
<p>the people,' have been known as the King's highways,
</p>
<p>or the public highway, and have been open to the free
</p>
<p>use of all on payment of a small uniform tax or toll to
</p>
<p>keep them in repair. But now the most perfect, and
</p>
<p>bv far the most important roads known to mankind,
</p>
<p>are owned and managed as private property bv a com-
</p>
<p>paratively small number of private citizens.
</p>
<p>'In all its uses the railroad is the most public of all
</p>
<p>our roads, and in all the objects to which its work re-
</p>
<p>lates, the railway corporation, is as public as any or-
</p>
<p>ganization can be. But in the start it was labelled a
</p>
<p>private corporation, and, as far as its legal status is
</p>
<p>concerned, it is now grouped, with eleemosvnarv insti-
</p>
<p>tutions and private charities, and enjoys similar im-
</p>
<p>munities and exemptions. It remains to be seen how
</p>
<p>long the community will suffer itself to be the victim
</p>
<p>of an abstract definition."
</p>
<p>"It will be readily conceded that a corporation is
</p>
<p>strictly and really private, when it is authorized to
</p>
<p>carry on such a business as a private citizen may carry
</p>
<p>on. But when the state has delegated to a corpor-
</p>
<p>ation the sovereign right of eminent domain, the right
</p>
<p>to take from the private citizen, without his consent,
</p>
<p>a portion of his real estate, to build its structures
</p>
<p>across farms, gardens and lawns, into and through,
</p>
<p>over or under, the blocks, squares, streets, churches,
</p>
<p>and dwellings of incorporated cities and towns, across
</p>
<p>navigable rivers, and over and along public highways,
</p>
<p>it requires a stretch of the common imagination, and
</p>
<p>much refinement and subtility of the law, to maintain

<p>the old fiction that such an organization is not a public

</p>
<p>corporation."
</p>
<p>"In view of the facts already set forth, the question
</p>
<p>returns, what is likely to be the effect of railways and
</p>
<p>other similar combinations upon our community and
</p>
<p>our political institutions? Is it true, as asserted by the
</p>
<p>British writer, that the state must soon recapture and
</p>
<p>control the railroads or be captured and subjugated by
</p>
<p>them? Or do the phenomena we are witnessing in-
</p>
<p>dicate the general breaking up of the social and polit-
</p>
<p>ical order of modern nations so confidently predicted
</p>
<p>by a class of philosophers whose opinions have hither-
</p>
<p>to made but little impression on the public mind? The
</p>
<p>analogv between the industrial conditions of society at
</p>
<p>the present time and the feudalism of the middle ages
</p>
<p>is both striking and instructive. In the darkness and
</p>
<p>chaos of that period the feudal system was the first
</p>
<p>important step towards the organization of modern
</p>
<p>times. Powerful chiefs and barons entrenched them-
</p>
<p>selves in castles, and in return for submission and ser-
</p>
<p>vice gave to their vassals rude protection and ruder
</p>
<p>laws. But as the feudal chiefs grew in power and
</p>
<p>wealth the}^ became the oppression of their people,
</p>
<p>taxed and robbed them at will, and finally in their ar-
</p>
<p>rogance defied the kings and emperors of the med-
</p>
<p>ieval states. From their castles planted on the great
</p>
<p>thoroughfares, they practiced the most capricious ex-
</p>
<p>tortions on commerce and travel, and thus gave to
</p>
<p>modern language the phrase, to levy black mail.

<p>of commercial or industrial feudalism. The modern

<p>barons, more powerful than their military prototypes,
</p>
<p>own our greatest highways and levy tribute at will up-
</p>
<p>on all our vast industries, and as the old feudalism was

<p>finally controlled and subordinated only by the com-
</p>
<p>bined effort of the kings and the people of the free
</p>
<p>cities and towns, so our modern feudalism can be sub-
</p>
<p>ordinated to the public good, only by the great body
</p>
<p>of the people, acting through the goverment by wise
</p>
<p>and just laws.

<p>and energy which have developed these tremendous
</p>
<p>forces, will fail to make them not the masters, but the
</p>
<p>faithful servants of society." ' Fourteen years have been
</p>
<p>added to intensify the picture, as seen by the mind of
</p>
<p>one of our greatest thinkers, and who shall say that
</p>
<p>the evils pictured bv him have been mitigated? The
</p>
<p>inter-state commerce law has done something for com-
</p>
<p>merce, but where are the laws to mitigate the evils of
</p>
<p>necessary "submission and service?" Who have under-
</p>
<p>taken to amend the "rude protection and ruder laws"*
</p>
<p>for their servants? And has not state, and even na-
</p>
<p>tional legislation, at least in a great measure, been sub-
</p>
<p>jugated to the aggressive greed of private corpora-
</p>
<p>tions ?

<p>CHAPTER XXXVII.
</p>
<p>ANTAGONISM.
</p>
<p>The Burlington people were beginning to under-
</p>
<p>stand that none of the old men worth mentioning
</p>
<p>would return to work, instead of having thirty-five or
</p>
<p>forty per cent stay with them. Mr. Stone, realizing the
</p>
<p>value of their services, made an effort through the
</p>
<p>local officials to regain them, and his instructions
</p>
<p>were complied with, as thoroughly as it was possible.
</p>
<p>The wives of one class of emploves were sent to the
</p>
<p>wives of strikers to get them to induce their husbands
</p>
<p>to return to the company, but the wives were as loyal
</p>
<p>as their husbands, and in many instances, they were
</p>
<p>the very power that held them. The letter is as fol-
</p>
<p>lows:
</p>
<p>Chicago, February 28, 188S.
</p>
<p>*' Dear Sir :  The time is not far off when our men
</p>
<p>must necessarily decide whether they wish to perma-
</p>
<p>nently sever their connection with the company or not.
</p>
<p>We have purposely proceeded somewhat slowly in
</p>
<p>emploving new men in any great numbers, in order to
</p>
<p>give the men who have been in our service, time for
</p>
<p>reflection; but a considerable number of men from the
</p>
<p>Reading district and other parts of the east, will be
</p>
<p>here within a day or two and will go to work, and
</p>
<p>any new men employed, who are competent, and of
</p>
<p>good character, will not be discharged in order that

</p>
<p>we may take back the men who have left the service.
</p>
<p>ANTAGONISM. 247
</p>
<p>We are extremely anxious that such of our old men as
</p>
<p>are competent, sober, and industrious, should come
</p>
<p>back to the service. We know perfectly that many
</p>
<p>of them, probably a majority, have entered into this
</p>
<p>strike at the instigation of hot-heads and agitators, and
</p>
<p>that it is impossible that they should sincerely and
</p>
<p>seriously desire to leave the service where they know,
</p>
<p>as well as we do, that they have always been well paid
</p>
<p>and well treated."
</p>
<p>" In a strike of this kind, and in the excitement of the
</p>
<p>moment, men are led to act hastily, and with a vague
</p>
<p>impression that they are going to force the company to
</p>
<p>yield to their demands. The time is at hand therefore,
</p>
<p>if it lias not arrived now, when a great deal can be done
</p>
<p>by personal talk to induce good men to return to the
</p>
<p>service, and give up what must inevitably be a con-
</p>
<p>test full of disaster to them if it is proceeded in. Many
</p>
<p>of our men have grown up in the service, and their
</p>
<p>homes are on the line of our road; their property, if
</p>
<p>thev have accumulated any, is here with us, and our
</p>
<p>interests are identical. Aside from the interests which
</p>
<p>the company has as a matter of business in having
</p>
<p>these men returned to the service in preference to
</p>
<p>getting new men, we very much desire to save the
</p>
<p>men themselves from the consequences of righting this
</p>
<p>matter to the end, and forcing the company to man
</p>
<p>the road with new hands."
</p>
<p>"We realize fully the situation ; we know the difficul-
</p>
<p>ty of filling the places of good men who know the
</p>
<p>road, and we know the losses to the road of a pro-
</p>
<p>longed conflict."

</p>
<p>account, but you can see, and any man who will stop
</p>
<p>to think can see, that it is simply impossible for the
</p>
<p>company to yield to the demands which have been
</p>
<p>made. We must, as a matter of self preservation,
</p>
<p>fight it out, no matter at what expenditure of time and
</p>
<p>money. I hope, therefore, that you and others hold-
</p>
<p>ing positions in the service which enable them to do
</p>
<p>so, will use the utmost exertion to convince our men
</p>
<p>by personal persuasion, by pointing out to them the
</p>
<p>inevitable consequences of a continued contest, to in-
</p>
<p>duce the men to come back into the service, satisfied
</p>
<p>to let the company and its officers manage their own
</p>
<p>property. It is obvious that men who are receiving
</p>
<p>$4 and $5 a day cannot expect public sympathy in anv
</p>
<p>demand for more, which is carried to the extent of a
</p>
<p>strike."
</p>
<p>"This contest can have but one end, and that end is
</p>
<p>just as easy to see now as it will be perhaps when it
</p>
<p>will be too late to do the old men any good. I hope
</p>
<p>you will do every thing in 3-our power to make them
</p>
<p>appreciate the Situation by talking to them singlv. and
</p>
<p>impressing on their minds the truth of what I have
</p>
<p>said above." ' (Signed) Henry B. Stone.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone says: "Many, probably a majority of the
</p>
<p>old men, have entered into this strike at the instigation
</p>
<p>of hot-heads." It would hardly seem probable that a
</p>
<p>few hot-heads could hold, against their will, nearly
</p>
<p>every man, not only for a day but for months. From
</p>
<p>mv own knowledge, the men who did go back, were
</p>
<p>the " hot-heads, " in nearly every case. The men who
</p>
<p>were most ready with vituperation at the beginning of
</p>
<p>the strike, were the hardest to keep in a line of gentle-

<p>manlv deportment after the strike was fairly on; were
</p>
<p>first sought after by the Burlington, and first to secure
</p>
<p>a place. They remind me that in the war for the
</p>
<p>Union, a pugilist would always hunt a safe place out
</p>
<p>of range of danger. It was the every day thinking
</p>
<p>man. in office and out, who held all in line. But Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone said they were " holding off to give the old men
</p>
<p>a chance to come back, but that a considerable num-
</p>
<p>ber of men were coming from the Reading district and
</p>
<p>other parts of the east." Let us see if we can ana-
</p>
<p>lyze the nature of this demonstration from the east, of
</p>
<p>which Mr. Stone speaks. How did he know so soon
</p>
<p>that these men were coming ?
</p>
<p>Who were all these men who so readily loaned
</p>
<p>themselves to the Burlington company? Where did
</p>
<p>they come from, and what was the incentive? What
</p>
<p>was their character? "More men went in and out of
</p>
<p>the offices of the company, at Chicago in one day, at
</p>
<p>the beginning of the strike, than probably any time
</p>
<p>since they were built. The great majority of them
</p>
<p>claimed to be engineers or firemen. They had heard
</p>
<p>the rumbling and threatening of war; it had come; so
</p>
<p>had they. The passage way leading to the general
</p>
<p>superintendent's office was crowded from early morn-
</p>
<p>ing until sunset. In answer to questions put to a num-
</p>
<p>ber of these applicants they all represented that they
</p>
<p>had more or less of experience as either engineers or
</p>
<p>firemen. Some appeared to be quite intelligent, while
</p>
<p>others were either reticent or ignorant. A few
</p>
<p>among them belonged to the Knights of Labor, but
</p>
<p>none of them, as far as could be ascertained, belonged

<p>to the Brotherhoods. One of the Knights said, 'I

</p>
<p>went out with the southwestern strike of engineers.
</p>
<p>One of the Brothers took my place. I have not been
</p>
<p>able to get any work since and I am trying now to get
</p>
<p>a Brother's place. When a man has been slapped on
</p>
<p>the face it is not unreasonable that he should return
</p>
<p>the blow." 1 There had been no strike of engineers in
</p>
<p>the southwest. The stories that the motley multitude
</p>
<p>told were stereotyped. The men who were hired or
</p>
<p>bought, or appealed to by the strikers, all told very
</p>
<p>much the same story, and there was one feature that
</p>
<p>strongly marked almost every narrative, the story had
</p>
<p>stamped on the face of it, "lie." I do not say they all
</p>
<p>did this : many of them came to the Burlington appar-
</p>
<p>entlv indifferent as to anyone's opinion of their con-
</p>
<p>duct, and had no need to lie to preserve their reputa-
</p>
<p>tion. Some of this kind had been in the business of
</p>
<p>scab before. "Most of these applicants were respect-
</p>
<p>ablv dressed, although here and there, the marks of
</p>
<p>having been out of work were plainly visible ; there
</p>
<p>were nearly 200 of them." '
</p>
<p>The examination as to their fitness was entrusted to
</p>
<p>G. W. Rhodes, superintendent of motive power, and
</p>
<p>Mr. ]. V. Murray, traveling engineer on the Chicago
</p>
<p>division of the road. These officers were occupied
</p>
<p>the whole day, and, at the conclusion of their labors,

<p>the following men were among the thirty who had
</p>
<p>been selected after they had satisfied their interrogators

<p>as to their competency: Engineers, Charles Riggs,

<p>Fitch, H. C. Lefont, John Hogan." The last named
</p>
<p>engineer, "Doc" Merriam, is known by hundreds of
</p>
<p>railroad men. He was discharged from the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton as a worthless drunkard, and washed spittoons in
</p>
<p>Aurora to get drinks. The traveling engineer, J. V.
</p>
<p>Murray, who assisted in the examination of these men,
</p>
<p>was a member, (at that time) of Division 127, of
</p>
<p>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, Beardstown,
</p>
<p>111., and for the sake of a place entered into this work
</p>
<p>for the company with great zest, and he was expelled
</p>
<p>by his divison for violation of obligation.
</p>
<p>From all the reports circulated about the Reading
</p>
<p>railroad men, and others from Pennsylvania, it would
</p>
<p>look as though hajf of the population of that state
</p>
<p>were engineers and firemen, and all out of work, and
</p>
<p>had a personal grudge against the Burlington engi-
</p>
<p>neers and firemen. The onlv instance within our
</p>
<p>knowledge of official interference, is in the following :
</p>
<p>"Reading, Penn., Feb. 26, 1888. Capt. Geo. L. East-
</p>
<p>man, national organizer of the Knights of Labor, is au-
</p>
<p>thority for the statement that the executive committee
</p>
<p>of the Reading railroad strikers have notified General
</p>
<p>Manager Stone, of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincv,
</p>
<p>that in the event of a strike on his road, and a failure of
</p>
<p>Chief Arthur to withdraw the Brotherhood engineers
</p>
<p>who took their places on the Reading road, they will
</p>
<p>send him three hundred engineers tomorrow morning." 2
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that a strike of the Knights
</p>
<p>of Labor occurred on December 24, 1887. The
</p>
<p>Reading engineers being members of the Knights of
</p>
<p>Labor, were ordered out, to assist in coercing

<p>the miners and coal handlers of that company, which
</p>
<p>controls the greater part of the coal fields of Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania, are, and have been for years, steadily ground
</p>
<p>down until the condition has become un-American
</p>
<p>and indecent. It could only exist under such a com-
</p>
<p>bination as the Reading railroad made with the coal
</p>
<p>and iron interest. A committee of Congress investi-
</p>
<p>gated this matter in 1887 and 1888, and showed up
</p>
<p>the manner in which the mine owner, the railroad
</p>
<p>officials, the Pinkerton coal and iron police, and the
</p>
<p>officials of the commonwealth, combined to defraud
</p>
<p>labor of its just reward, to force the public to bin' coal
</p>
<p>at a factitious price, and to gamble away the rights of
</p>
<p>the people.
</p>
<p>Harper's Weekly of June 16, 1888, in describing
</p>
<p>the coal mines of Pennsylvania, has this to sav of the
</p>
<p>wages and life of miners :
</p>
<p>" Wages are very low in the coal regions. Labor-
</p>
<p>ers receive from sixty to eighty cents a day. Year in
</p>
<p>and year out, for the last ten years, during which time
</p>
<p>the cheap foreigners have been coming to this coun-
</p>
<p>try in great numbers, the average daily wages for a
</p>
<p>common laborer has probablv not been more than
</p>
<p>seventy cents a day. With the stopping of work very
</p>
<p>few laborers make more than $12 a month the year
</p>
<p>round, and a third of this must go as rent for the
</p>
<p>shanty. Eight dollars a month is very little in the ex-
</p>
<p>pensive coal regions for food, clothes and medicine."
</p>
<p>"There is many a miner who goes without dinner
</p>
<p>day after day, and who tightens his belt when noon
</p>
<p>comes."

<p>the dinner pail. There is no allowance made by the

<p>Wholesale evictions take place in Pennsylvania, as
</p>
<p>in Ireland, and scenes of brutal indifference to human
</p>
<p>suffering, may be seen in the one country, as in the
</p>
<p>other."
</p>
<p>It is not surprising that those men were aggravated
</p>
<p>to think that any other class of labor should refuse to
</p>
<p>assist in bettering these conditions, instead of, ( as
</p>
<p>they claim, i tilling the vacated places, and thereby
</p>
<p>breaking down the only power they possessed to
</p>
<p>make the conditions better. Yet it is not reason-
</p>
<p>able to charge any labor organization, as such, with
</p>
<p>the responsibility of the acts of individuals beyond
</p>
<p>their control. Thev might be members, and be com-
</p>
<p>manded as P. M. Arthur commanded in 1886: "Keep
</p>
<p>your hands off! Do nothing which belongs to another
</p>
<p>to do,  in fact, mind your own business!" It was
</p>
<p>the position occupied by the Brotherhood of engineers
</p>
<p>in 1886, and it was all they asked at the beginning of
</p>
<p>the strike in 1888. They did not ask any help from
</p>
<p>any other Orders. The engineers and firemen were
</p>
<p>willing to go it alone, and only asked, hands off.

</p>
<p>they took as an institution in the southwestern striker
</p>
<p>That individuals violated this principle of non-inter-
</p>
<p>ference, there was never a better illustration than in
</p>
<p>the Burlington strike. Messrs. Arthur and Sargent
</p>
<p>both deny that they had any knowledge of members of
</p>
<p>their respective Orders taking the Knight's places.
</p>
<p>That there was much feeling against the engineers,
</p>
<p>there can be no question, and it evidently emanated
</p>
<p>from the isolated position they have always occupied
</p>
<p>of "no amalgamation." The}' have been patted on
</p>
<p>the back from year to year, for occupying this posi-
</p>
<p>tion, by the leading representatives of capital. In fact,
</p>
<p>capital usually has one class of labor to use as a club
</p>
<p>to break down the power of some other organization
</p>
<p>whose members are trying to better their condition.
</p>
<p>It appeared to be the Knight's turn to have their backs
</p>
<p>patted. The Burlington had, in 1886, ordered the
</p>
<p>Knights of Labor off their premises, but in 18S8 they

<p>were gladly welcomed and many came, but not with

<p>ATTITUDE OF THE KNIGHTS OF LABOR.

<p>Richard Griffiths, the grand worthy foreman of the

<p>Order said : " There is absolutely no foundation in the
</p>
<p>report that our Order will interfere with the striking-
</p>
<p>Brotherhood, nor will any attempt be made bv the
</p>
<p>Order to supply the Burlington people with engineers
</p>
<p>to enable them to defeat these men. The best of
</p>
<p>feeling exists between Mr. Powderlv and Chief Ar-
</p>
<p>thur, and the Order, as an Order, has no grievance
</p>
<p>whatever against the Brotherhood. Of course, there
</p>
<p>may be individual cases where men have griefs. If
</p>
<p>they go to the Burlington road and apply for work,
</p>
<p>they will do so as individuals, and not otherwise." "It
</p>
<p>is true." said Mr. Griffiths, " that in the strike of the
</p>
<p>Missouri Pacific, Chief Arthur asked his men to leave
</p>
<p>our Order, but that did not create any bad feeling.
</p>
<p>You may state authoritatively that, not only will the
</p>
<p>Knights of Labor Order not assist the Burlington

<p>road, but that its sympathies are with the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood first and last." '

<p>any of the engineers from the east, now en route to

<p>Chicago, are members of the Knights of Labor. Our

<p>In connection with this, many rumors have been set
</p>
<p>afloat, that this monopoly of a corporate power would
</p>
<p>be aided in their contest against their company, by
</p>
<p>members of the Knights of Labor, who are reported as
</p>
<p>being anxious to take their places, actuated by feel-
</p>
<p>ings of retaliation for bad conduct the Brotherhood is
</p>
<p>claimed to have been guilty of towards our Order
</p>
<p>during similar contests in the past. Without going
</p>
<p>into an examination as to whether this charge against
</p>
<p>the Brotherhood is false or true, the executive board
</p>
<p>of D. A. 24, Knights of Labor, unqualifiedly protests
</p>
<p>against any of its members taking the places of these
</p>
<p>striking workers."
</p>
<p>We call on the members of our Order everywhere,
</p>
<p>to refuse under any and all circumstances, to become
</p>
<p>the tools of this corporation in their hour of trouble.
</p>
<p>If the members of the Brotherhood have been guiltv
</p>
<p>of any wrong towards our Order, this wrong cannot
</p>
<p>be righted by committing another. By the exhibition
</p>
<p>on our part, of a higher and nobler manhood in the
</p>
<p>cause of struggling labor, we may prove to them our
</p>
<p>worth as Knights, thereby sowing the seed of that
</p>
<p>higher fraternity that should exist among all bodies of

<p>organized labor. Let no Knight fire an engine or

</p>
<p>The Executive Board, D. A. 24, Knights of Labor,
</p>
<p>George Schilling, Chairman,
</p>
<p>William Turnbull, Secretary.
</p>
<p>District Assembly 79, which includes the state of
</p>
<p>Minnesota, issued an order on February 28, advising
</p>
<p>against interference : " To the Order in District as-
</p>
<p>semblv 79, Knights of Labor: Greeting: The District
</p>
<p>Executive Board fully endorse the sentiments in the
</p>
<p>manifesto of District Assembly 24, of Chicago, advis-
</p>
<p>ing all knights to refrain from taking the places of the
</p>
<p>striking engineers and firemen on the Chicago, Bur-
</p>
<p>lington & Quincy railroad. By taking this position,
</p>
<p>the board believes that it will show to those who seek
</p>
<p>to sow discord between the different labor organiza-
</p>
<p>tions, that we are above the low spirit of revenge that
</p>
<p>has so often thwarted the efforts of organizations in
</p>
<p>the past. While the Brotherhood, may, in the past,
</p>
<p>have taken a stand in opposition to our efforts, yet by
</p>
<p>retaliating on them in their hour of trouble, nothing
</p>
<p>will be gained, and the antagonism will become more
</p>
<p>bitter. It is by showing our manhood under such
</p>
<p>circumstances, that we will ultimately bring about the
</p>
<p>complete realization of our object, viz: to bring to-
</p>
<p>gether in one organization, and bind by one fraternal
</p>
<p>tie, every man and woman who toils for a living." '
</p>
<p>On the 29th of February, twenty-five men, said to
</p>
<p>have been Reading engineers, were quartered at the
</p>
<p>Briggs house, Chicago. One of them, on being in-

</p>
<p>They desire the defeat of the Brotherhood. I am

<p>not here as a Knight of Labor, but as a first-class

</p>
<p>more from the Reading road who felt as he did, he
</p>
<p>said: " You bet your life, there are ! The Reading
</p>
<p>engineers went on a strike in company with forty-

<p>nia, and he comes to Illinois to get even with the man
</p>
<p>in Pennsylvania, by doing what he acknowledges was
</p>
<p>a mean thing for the other man to do. While he is
</p>
<p>doing this, he is rilled with sympathy for the men
</p>
<p>whom he comes  for the sake of vengeance  to harm.
</p>
<p>"Two wrongs never made right," and as it has been
</p>
<p>said before, nearly all of these men had an elaborate
</p>
<p>excuse to offer for coming. When a man says he comes
</p>
<p>filled with sympathy for his intended victims, that man
</p>
<p>should join the socialists, and no labor organization
</p>
<p>should be held accountable for his acts. If he had
</p>
<p>said " I hold I am fulfilling my duty to myself and
</p>
<p>family," and stopped there, he would not have exposed
</p>
<p>the fact that he came to the Burlington to do what he
</p>
<p>condemned as an outrage on the Reading.
</p>
<p>General Master Workman Powderly, of the Knights
</p>
<p>of Labor, defines very forcibly what he thinks of
</p>
<p>such a man as the above, no matter what he belongs
</p>
<p>to. He said : " I have been asked what my opinion
</p>
<p>is concerning the strike of the engineers on the Bur-

<p>lington system. An expression of opinion is request-
</p>
<p>ed as to whether I favor Knights of Labor taking the

<p>places of Brotherhood men. I do not know the par-
</p>
<p>ticulars of the strike question, but if true men are
</p>
<p>making an effort to do away with the European cus-
</p>
<p>tom of grading men up and down, regardless of merit,
</p>
<p>they are right for making a light for equality. My
</p>
<p>opinion is, that the man who takes the place of another
</p>
<p>struggling for his rights, deserves the contempt and
</p>
<p>scorn of everv man who loves justice. The man who

<p>CHAPTER XXXIX.
</p>
<p>NEGOTIATIONS FOR HARMONY.
</p>
<p>For all these strong expressions from the chief men
</p>
<p>of the Knights and kindred orders, there seemed to be
</p>
<p>a concordant movement on the part of the ex-Reading
</p>
<p>employes, to come to the Burlington. The press of
</p>
<p>the country took it up, and with great energy magni-
</p>
<p>fied not only the numbers, but the presumed grievan-
</p>
<p>ces of the Knights against the Brotherhood of Engi-
</p>
<p>neers and Brotherhood of Firemen. They quoted
</p>
<p>sayings of Grand Chief Arthur, and doings of individ-
</p>
<p>uals, in order to help to widen the breach. All the
</p>
<p>antipathy so created was in the direct interest
</p>
<p>of monopoly. All the vast railroad interests were
</p>
<p>interested in making this the wedge to divide the
</p>
<p>power of organized labor. The more they magnified
</p>
<p>the picture of wrongs done, the wider the breach, and
</p>
<p>the better for the Burlington.
</p>
<p>It is evident from Mr. Stone's letter in a preceding
</p>
<p>chapter, that he had been notified of their coming.
</p>
<p>When they began to arrive they were met by the
</p>
<p>strikers' committee. Thev were reminded that they
</p>
<p>came to injure men who had in no way injured them,
</p>
<p>and who could not be held accountable for the acts of
</p>
<p>some individuals in Pennsylvania. A few were found
</p>
<p>who had a spark of manliness left, and the earnest ap-
</p>
<p>peals of the committees would sometimes help them

<p>to see how much thev were violating the princi]

</p>
<p>that should actuate one laboring man towards another.
</p>
<p>How generous and considerate, and how chivalric do
</p>
<p>all men believe a knight, a true knight to be. If
</p>
<p>they were true knights, why did they come ?
</p>
<p>By such appeals a few were induced to agree to re-
</p>
<p>turn if transportation was furnished, and many did
</p>
<p>return, or at least went elsewhere. Many of them
</p>
<p>were no doubt impostors. But such things cannot be
</p>
<p>avoided in such times. When excitement is at boiling
</p>
<p>heat the scum is sure to come to the surface. The
</p>
<p>human vultures, like the other kind, are always ready
</p>
<p>to take whatever falls in their way, whether the means
</p>
<p>to be used are false or fair. The strikers had expect-
</p>
<p>ed men would present themselves for the places vacat-
</p>
<p>ed, in some numbers, but they did not think any
</p>
<p>members of labor organizations would come, and it
</p>
<p>was evident something must be done to check, if pos-
</p>
<p>sible, this movement.
</p>
<p>At this time there appeared upon the scene, one
</p>
<p>who claimed to be the leader of this army of Reading
</p>
<p>men.
</p>
<p>"Joseph Cahill, secretary of the executive board
</p>
<p>of the Reading employes, brought Chief Arthur and
</p>
<p>Grand Master Sargent official information that 150
</p>
<p>members of their Order had taken the places of the
</p>
<p>Knights of Labor on the Reading road."
</p>
<p>" Both Chief Arthur and Mr. Sargent have denied
</p>
<p>repeatedly that the}' knew that these men had taken
</p>
<p>the places of the Reading striking employes. They
</p>
<p>assured Mr. Cahill that they had no knowledge other
</p>
<p>than newspaper reports that this thing had occurred.

</p>
<p>Both gentlemen expressed a willingness to play fair
</p>
<p>NEGOTIATIONS FOR HARMONY. 263
</p>
<p>with the knights, and an agreement was entered into
</p>
<p>by which Mr. Arthur and Mr. Sargent agreed to re-
</p>
<p>quest their men to quit the Reading road's employ-
</p>
<p>ment."
</p>
<p>" In return for this Mr. Cahill agreed to keep the
</p>
<p>150 to 200 Reading engineers and firemen in the city
</p>
<p>from taking places on the Chicago, Burlington &
</p>
<p>Quincy road. These men will be held here twenty-
</p>
<p>four hours. If the Brotherhood men obey the request
</p>
<p>of their chiefs and quit the Reading road the Knights
</p>
<p>of Labor men here will return to Reading and other
</p>
<p>points along the Reading lines whence they came.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cahill telegraphed other contingents of Reading
</p>
<p>nun to remain where the}- were. He estimated the
</p>
<p>number of engineers out of employment along the
</p>
<p>Reading lines at six to eight hundred."
</p>
<p>" Chief Arthur, about five o'clock, on the evening
</p>
<p>of February 2, sent the following telegram to Mr.
</p>
<p>Edward Kent, chairman of the executive board of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers of the Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia & Reading railroad company:"
</p>
<p>" ' Go to Philadelphia and use all your influence to
</p>
<p>have the members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
</p>
<p>Engineers on the Phildelphia & Reading road who
</p>
<p>have taken the places of the men who went out
</p>
<p>December 27, 1887, to leave the service of the com-
</p>
<p>pany, furnishing them with the financial support of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood. The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
</p>
<p>company is striving to use Reading strikers to defeat
</p>
<p>us in this conflict. We must use all honorable means
</p>
<p>to checkmate it."'

</p>
<p>He at once telegraphed Mr. Arthur that he would go

<p>to Philadelphia immediately."

</p>
<p>Harry Walton, chairman of the executive board of
</p>
<p>firemen at Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>Chicago, March 3, 1888.
</p>
<p>Harry Walton:
</p>
<p>" See all members of the Brotherhood on the
</p>
<p>Philadelphia & Reading railroad that have taken the
</p>
<p>places of the men that went out December 27, 1887,
</p>
<p>and request them to sever their connection with the
</p>
<p>company, and I will pay them untill they can find em-
</p>
<p>ployment elsewhere, and allow the men now out to
</p>
<p>return to work. By doing this, the ill-feeling now
</p>
<p>existing will be obliterated, and will assist us to win
</p>
<p>our struggle with the Burlington."
</p>
<p>(Signed) F. P. Sargent.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sargent promised the men support until they
</p>
<p>could find employment elsewhere. Mr. Walton re-
</p>
<p>sponded by telegraph that he would at once issue the
</p>
<p>necessary orders. Messrs. Arthur and Sargent
</p>
<p>thought these men would obey their requests, as they
</p>
<p>both thought the men were in the wrong in taking the
</p>
<p>places of the organized workmen. In order to insure
</p>
<p>greater success in this movement it was thought best
</p>
<p>to secure the services of some one who belonged to the
</p>
<p>Knights of Labor and was directly interested in the
</p>
<p>strike on the Burlington. Mr. J. J. Delanev, who was

<p>a member of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen

<p>and also a member of the Knights of Labor, was se-

<p>cured, who proceeded to Philadelphia to co-operate

<p>NEGOTIATION'S FOR HARMONY. 265
</p>
<p>It is said, George E. Detwiler of Chicago, a mem-
</p>
<p>ber of the Knights of Labor, and editor of a labor
</p>
<p>paper, rendered valuable assistance in this effort to
</p>
<p>dissuade the knights. While these negotiations were
</p>
<p>pending, nearly one hundred new arrivals reached the
</p>
<p>city of Chicago, and were quartered at the Briggs
</p>
<p>house. They claimed that thev were all Reading-
</p>
<p>men. The Brotherhood's committees, ever watchful,
</p>
<p>were on hand, and " knots of excited men gathered
</p>
<p>around the leaders and the war of words waged thick
</p>
<p>and fast. The Reading men openly accused Chief
</p>
<p>Arthur of causing the troubles on that road, but de-
</p>
<p>spite all the gesticulating and loud talk many were in
</p>
<p>favor of a settlement. The Brotherhood delegates
</p>
<p>told the new-comers of the settlement between Arthur
</p>
<p>and Powderly. ' We won't go back unless we are
</p>
<p>recalled by Corbin himself,' shouted several of the
</p>
<p>Reading men. ' If Chief Arthur calls the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood men off the Reading road will you go back and
</p>
<p>fight your own battles?' A few said thev would.
</p>
<p>The committees were aided materially by two Knights
</p>
<p>of Labor from Reading, said to represent Mr. Pow-
</p>
<p>derly. They knew the men and placed a chalk mark
</p>
<p>on every good man." " A number of the Reading men
</p>
<p>were not skilled engineers. A large percentage of
</p>
<p>them were firemen, and a great number were incom-
</p>
<p>petent men who were given free transportation to
</p>
<p>Chicago. The Brotherhood's committees were after
</p>
<p>the competent men and hired about half of the entire
</p>
<p>number." ' These were furnished free transportation,
</p>
<p>and they returned to Pennsylvania. At the Brother-

</p>
<p>THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>was a scene of exciting activity. Men were there of
</p>
<p>all kinds, nationalities and interests, scores of them.
</p>
<p>The deceived, some were deceivers, and others were
</p>
<p>repentant. Said one of these men: "I came here on
</p>
<p>mv own responsibility. I do not belong to the Broth-
</p>
<p>erhood, neither am I a Knight of Labor. I was out of
</p>
<p>.vork and came from Reading here. I didn't want to
</p>
<p>go farther west than Chicago. Thev wanted me to
</p>
<p>go to Nebraska, though I have a contract for work
</p>
<p>here. Five others came with me and we want to get
</p>
<p>transportation back home. I don't like the looks of
</p>
<p>the situation."
</p>
<p>The committee sent to the Reading road by Messrs.
</p>
<p>Arthur and Sargent, had a meeting with the Reading
</p>
<p>strikers, who repudiated Mr. CahilPs authority- to speak
</p>
<p>for them, and insisted upon the ordering out of every
</p>
<p>Brotherhood man on the Reading road. This meant
</p>
<p>another strike on the Reading, which the grand offi-
</p>
<p>cers of the two Brotherhoods had no power to effect.
</p>
<p>Their constitutions onlv gave them power to sanction
</p>
<p>a strike when the men had voted it. The Reading
</p>
<p>road has 800 engines, and at the time of this strike it
</p>
<p>is said there were not more than twenty Brotherhood
</p>
<p>men employed on that road.
</p>
<p>Nearly all those who had taken the places of the
</p>
<p>striking knights, were not members of any organiza-
</p>
<p>tion. Many of them were said to be the dissipated
</p>
<p>refuse of other railroads and of the Brotherhoods.
</p>
<p>Some of them were the men who struck against Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Gowan's order to withdraw from the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood, or from the service of that company in 1877.
</p>

<p>NEGOTAITIOXS FOR HARMONY. 267
</p>
<p>by some of these same men who struck in 1887 as
</p>
<p>Knights of Labor. These men, many of whom were
</p>
<p>still in Pennsylvania, and had not run an engine since
</p>
<p>1877, and being bound by no labor ties, went back
</p>
<p>to the Reading company. This committee, which was
</p>
<p>sent to negotiate peace with these knights, only found
</p>
<p>eleven engineers and seven firemen who belonged to
</p>
<p>these Orders, at work on the Reading road. It must
</p>
<p>now be evident to the reader that when the Reading
</p>
<p>men claimed that the Brotherhood as an Order, had
</p>
<p>rilled their places in 1887, they were entirely mistaken.
</p>
<p>It is also plain that they used this pretext for an excuse
</p>
<p>for doing what thev evidently felt was as mean in
</p>
<p>themselves to do as it had been in those who, it was
</p>
<p>said, took their places. Everything was done by the
</p>
<p>officers of the Knights of Labor to prevent any mem-
</p>
<p>bers of their Order coming to the Burlington, and
</p>
<p>they should in no way be held responsible for the acts
</p>
<p>of these men as individuals. The good will of the
</p>
<p>Order was shown on ever}' hand and in the west they
</p>
<p>made the Burlington feel their power in a depleted

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XL.
</p>
<p>FEINT, FOR EFFECT.
</p>
<p>It is evident that the Reading men were grossly
</p>
<p>misrepresented. Where there was one Knight of
</p>
<p>Labor who did come, there were one hundred who
</p>
<p>claimed to be Knights who never had seen the Read-
</p>
<p>ing road. The officers of the Burlington road were
</p>
<p>glad to call everything that came in the shape of
</p>
<p>an engineman, "direct from Reading." On March i,
</p>
<p>Master Mechanic J. W. Rhodes, from his headquar-
</p>
<p>ters in Chicago, sent out the following:
</p>
<p>"To all Master Mechanics:
</p>
<p>We have a large number of engineers just from
</p>
<p>the Reading road; can furnish you any number of en-
</p>
<p>gineers you want. Let me know as soon as possible
</p>
<p>how many you want.'" ' J. W. Rhodes.

<p>I have a message from Chicago saying that re-
</p>
<p>ported arrangements between P. M. Arthur and the
</p>
<p>Knights of Labor to take Brotherhood men off the
</p>
<p>Reading and send Reading men back, have no effect
</p>
<p>whatever upon those who have come to us from the
</p>
<p>Reading road. They seem to be more anxious to
</p>
<p>rind out how the}' can get their families west than to
</p>
<p>talk about going back to Pennsylvania. They say

<p>thev will have nothing to do with the Brotherhood of
</p>
<p>Locomotive Engineers and are well satisfied with
</p>
<p>their prospects. One hundred and fifty odd went to
</p>
<p>Nebraska, and one hundred and fifty more than we
</p>
<p>expected arrived this morning." '
</p>
<p>W. F. Merrill,
</p>
<p>General Manager.
</p>
<p>Much of this talk was no doubt intended to frighten
</p>
<p>the strikers, and create a stampede among them. The
</p>
<p>Burlington officials were too wise not to want the old
</p>
<p>men back if they could get them without receding
</p>
<p>from their position. The notice to apply on or before
</p>
<p>Wednesday noon of February 29, had done no good; if
</p>
<p>anything it had increased the strikers' determination to
</p>
<p>fight it out; thev would not accept their salary, and
</p>
<p>did not go for it until the pay car come out at its reg-
</p>
<p>ular time. The great news dispenser for the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton, during the strike, was Mr. Paul Morton, general
</p>
<p>ticket agent, who was formerly a reporter on a news-
</p>
<p>paper in Nebraska. Having been educated in the
</p>
<p>newspaper business, he knew how to work the ma-
</p>
<p>chine for all it was worth. He was a terse, forcible writ-
</p>
<p>er, and was always ready to dish up news in any
</p>
<p>quantitv to whomsoever might come, and he never
</p>
<p>forgot the coloring.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Morton said 250 competent engineers and fire-
</p>
<p>men had been accepted by the company, and had
</p>
<p>been sent out to man engines on various divisions of
</p>
<p>the road. These men were principally ex-employes
</p>
<p>of the Reading, whose places had been filled with
</p>
<p>Brotherhood men. Mr. Morton said that several oth-

</p>
<p>"Great excitement was occasioned at the Union de-
</p>
<p>pot on the evening of March i, upon the departure of
</p>
<p>the 5:35 p. m. train, known as the Denver express.
</p>
<p>The engine of this train was manned by a Reading
</p>
<p>engineer and fireman, who had an old brakeman, for
</p>
<p>a pilot, in the cab with them, and all were armed with
</p>
<p>revolvers. The train was composed of a mail car.
</p>
<p>three baggage cars, four day coaches, two chair cars
</p>
<p>and two sleepers. There were but three passengers
</p>
<p>in the chair cars, and none in the sleepers. A great
</p>
<p>crowd had collected in the vicinity, for the train was
</p>
<p>unusually long. About 5 :30 Lieutenant Fitzpatrick,
</p>
<p>with a detail of eight men, and Lieutenant Ross, of
</p>
<p>the Desplaines street station, came down leading a
</p>
<p>procession of over 200 men. They were Reading
</p>
<p>engineers and firemen who had come to help out the
</p>
<p>road in its difficulty. With them was a large posse
</p>
<p>of Pinkerton men under the command of Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Lane, and every one of the large body was armed
</p>
<p>with a 44 caliber revolver, readv for any emergency
</p>
<p>which might arise on the way The 200 men were
</p>
<p>placed in the four day coaches, each in charge of four
</p>
<p>Pinkerton men. The crowds thronged about the en-
</p>
<p>gine in the depot, but four stalwart policemen drove
</p>
<p>them away from the locomotive. General Manager

<p>of Motive Power Rhodes, were all on hand to see the
</p>
<p>orowd, and even Freddy Gebhard was attracted to the
</p>
<p>spot by the excitement. He was especially conspic-
</p>
<p>uous on the platform, with the bunch of blue violets in
</p>
<p>the left lapel of his coat, and his exceedingly small
</p>
<p>derby hat on his very large head, until somebody
</p>
<p>yelled, "Get onto the bloke!" when he vanished.
</p>
<p>The train started off very slowly, and there was a
</p>
<p>good deal of feeling shown by the crowd as it passed
</p>
<p>under the Van Buren street viaduct, but no person at-
</p>
<p>tempted or offered to do any violence." 1 And this is
</p>
<p>not all. On the same day one hundred more new ar-
</p>
<p>rivals of "fine looking fellows" were heralded, far and
</p>
<p>wid .
</p>
<p>Air. Morton said: "We first heard from the Read-
</p>
<p>ing men through committees appointed by them, and
</p>
<p>that they were ready to take the places of our strik-
</p>
<p>ing engineers. The storv that they were misinformed
</p>
<p>and supposed they were to work on new lines, is un-
</p>
<p>true. Our agents were instructed to inform them
</p>
<p>just what they were coming for." 2 It will be seen by
</p>
<p>the following that the number was greatly exaggerated.
</p>
<p>"One hundred more of the Reading engineers and
</p>
<p>firemen arrived last evening. Of these fifty-eight
</p>
<p>came on from the East over the Pennsylvania lines
</p>
<p>and arrived at 6:45 o'clock, and the remaining forty-
</p>
<p>two came in at 9:30. This body of men is by far the
</p>
<p>best looking, from a respectable standpoint, that has
</p>
<p>yet arrived. There were no guards with these men,
</p>
<p>as they insisted that they needed none, because they
</p>
<p>were able to take care of themselves. The first batch
</p>
<p>lingered about the Union Depot for a half hour, and

</p>
<p>also came in later, and found no one to meet them ex-
</p>
<p>cept a delegation of brotherhood engineers who en-
</p>
<p>deavored to proselyte them. This work was in vain.
</p>
<p>"We would not have come here to take these plao

<p>said one of the men, "but we are forced to it. There

<p>is no place for us in Pennsylvania. We have been

</p>
<p>neers. That is true, every word of it. Our men who
</p>
<p>were working in blast-furnaces at $i a day, were driv-
</p>
<p>en away like vagabonds to wander over the earth be-
</p>
<p>cause they were strikers. Yes, we are Knights of

<p>need. If the Brotherhood engineers had not inter-
</p>
<p>fered with us we would not have been here to-day.
</p>
<p>But they displaced us; now we displace them.

<p>There is no room for argument here. The facts are

<p>there, and we will abide by them."

<p>the reading public who found the newspapers filled

<p>with this astonishing exodus from Pennsylvania, and

<p>the wholesale charges of our labor organization

<p>against another, it must have brought vividly to

<p>mind the Irish, traditional duel:

<p>There was once two cats in Kilkenny,

<p>At the time this was written negotiations were
</p>
<p>pending with President Perkins which possibly lent
</p>
<p>some strength to Messrs. Arthur and Sargent's assur-
</p>
<p>ance. This meeting was brought about by Mr. Geo.

<p>E. Detwiler and Judge Parker, who thought that if a
</p>
<p>meeting could be arranged between the belligerent
</p>
<p>parties that some understanding might be reached.
</p>
<p>The meeting finally took place in President Perkins'
</p>
<p>room in the Grand Pacific hotel. There were two of
</p>
<p>the board of directors present, Mr. Detwiler and

<p>Messrs. Arthur and Sargent. A long discussion of the

<p>points at issue was had, and the grand officers ap-
</p>
<p>pealed to Mr. Perkins to grant the requests of the

<p>men, but to no purpose. The only proposition from
</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins was, " If you will declare the strike off,
</p>
<p>I will take back seventy-five per cent of the

<p>men, and the balance I will re-employ as soon as pos-

<p>peace, while the Burlington scabs were smashing the
</p>
<p>property, and the traveling public were going on foot
</p>
<p>rather than take the chances behind such men. The
</p>
<p>meeting caused the circulation of stories of a settle-
</p>
<p>ment, which did not please the management, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone sent the following to all superintendents and
</p>
<p>master mechanics: "The reports which I understand
</p>
<p>have been sent out to our old engineers and others to
</p>
<p>the effect that the company intends to yield the posi-
</p>
<p>tion it has taken is positively without foundation."
</p>
<p>Press Agent Morton lost nothing of his importance
</p>
<p>as these things were transpiring. While he passed
</p>
<p>round the cigars, he fairly beamed with information.
</p>
<p>To a running rire of questions, he summed up the
</p>
<p>situation in this way; " The situation, so far as to the
</p>
<p>relations between the strikers and the railroad, is un-
</p>
<p>changed. The conference last night was not sought
</p>
<p>by the company, and nothing was accomplished by it.
</p>
<p>We don't consider that any terms of compromise were
</p>
<p>offered or suggested. We consider it a great misfor-
</p>
<p>tune that our old engineers have been induced to give
</p>
<p>up their places, and it is with painful reluctance that
</p>
<p>we see their places being rapidly filled by strangers." '
</p>
<p>There is plenty of evidence that only a small percen-
</p>
<p>tage of the strangers were Knights of Labor. But
</p>
<p>men came, and in astonishing numbers. Mr. Arthur
</p>
<p>said : ; ' From all statistics in my possession there can-
</p>
<p>not be three hundred competent engineers in the
</p>
<p>country out of employment."

<p>locomotive. And, too, the engineer who used to
</p>
<p>jangle a bell on a State street grip car was hastily in-
</p>
<p>formed that he was not wanted."
</p>
<p>There must have been some of the stationary engi-
</p>
<p>neers, and street car bell janglers, that were sharp
</p>
<p>enough to fool the examiners if it was necessary to
</p>
<p>fool them, for it is certain they got many of that kind,
</p>
<p>and men who had their character and their watches 
</p>
<p>to use a slang phrase  in soak.
</p>
<p>" A number of the engineers examined and accept-
</p>
<p>ed by the Burlington company had no watches. An
</p>
<p>engineer without a watch is like a ship without a sail;
</p>
<p>a fork without a knife. The company gave these men
</p>
<p>watches. Half a dozen of them took their time-pieces
</p>
<p>to pawn-shops, and before the sun set had painted
</p>
<p>the town a purple hue.
</p>
<p>"The first train to leave the city went out at 12:01
</p>
<p>o'clock. W. H. Chapin, an imported engineer, was
</p>
<p>placed in charge of the lever, and a young man who
</p>
<p>answered to the name of Rankin and claimed to have
</p>
<p>hailed from Iowa, piled in the fuel. There was an
</p>
<p>impression abroad that Chapin was a Reading man,
</p>
<p>but he denied the charge. A funny thing happened
</p>
<p>just before the train started which afforded consider-
</p>
<p>able amusement for the crowd. The new engineer
</p>
<p>was somewhat abashed at the conspicuousness of the
</p>
<p>position which he occupied, and seemed to be unable
</p>
<p>to tell one end of the engine from another. He oiled
</p>
<p>the headlight and smokestack instead of the piston,
</p>
<p>and grabbed the fireman's arm instead of the lever.

</p>
<p>the fireman suddenly exclaimed: 'Say, pard, you've
</p>
<p>i irgot your ticker.' "
</p>
<p>" By Jove, I haven't got one," was the reply.
</p>
<p>" You blamed fool, you can't run an engine without

<p>neer who had been enjoying his discomfiture."
</p>
<p>" Shet your trap,"' shouted the fireman, and the po-
</p>
<p>lice stepped in to prevent bloodshed, while a gateman
</p>
<p>presented the eastern man with a ticker."
</p>
<p>" About four o'clock Superintendent Rowland was
</p>
<p>seen meandering down the track closely followed by a
</p>
<p>Jot of seedy-looking individuals who were at once
</p>
<p>recognized as importations."
</p>
<p> Where did you get your men? Superintendent
</p>
<p>Rowland was asked."'

<p>" From all over. I've got fifty to-day, and more are
</p>
<p>coming all the time. We will have all of ourtrainsby
</p>
<p>to-morrow. We are going to win this fight."
</p>
<p>" Considerable difficulty was experienced in select-
</p>
<p>ing a tit man from the squad, but one was finally found
</p>
<p>and placed in charge of engine 206 and it drove out
</p>
<p>for Aurora at 4:45. Another train was sent out at
</p>
<p>5 15. and the last one left the depot at 6: 30."

<p> The incoming trains did not seem to materialize.

<p>The bulletin-board announced in big letters that sever-
</p>
<p>al of the trains were on time, but the bulletin prevari-

</p>
<p>was not right on hand, and eleven hours later a tall
</p>
<p>man in a wolfskin overcoat solemnlv affirmed that he
</p>
<p>had watched for that train since daylight."
</p>
<p> Some experiences of the companv with its new
</p>
<p>engineers were amusing to the strikers but essentially
</p>
<p>exasperating to the officials of the road. A train
</p>
<p>sta: - ted from Galesburg with a new man, who said he
</p>
<p>knew his engine as well as if he had made it. Mis en-
</p>
<p>gine pawed and snorted like a race-horse at the start-
</p>
<p>ing stretch. It wanted to get away at the minute
</p>
<p>scratch and skim along the track like a bird. He got
</p>
<p>the word; the engineer ' gave her sand.' Away she
</p>
<p>sped for five miles. Then she balked; did not like
</p>
<p>her new rider. The injector belonged to the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood and the engineer did not. Before he knew what
</p>
<p>was up the injector had pumped the boiler full of cold
</p>
<p>water. The stop-cocks froze up and so did the engi-
</p>
<p>neer's gavetv. He sadly walked to the nearest station
</p>
<p>and telegraphed for an engine to pull him back.
</p>
<p>His engine was dead."
</p>
<p>" Four engines were reported to be ' burned out,'
</p>
<p>or dead, between Chicago and Galesburg. Two were
</p>
<p>said to be burned out on the Kansas City branch. A
</p>
<p>'burned-out engine' may cost $50 or $1,000 for re-
</p>
<p>pairs, according to the size of the burn."' '
</p>
<p>As an illustration of the danger to property and life

<p>daily occurring, we take this one instance from the

<p>Chicago Jlcrahi of March 2, 1888: " The 12 :oi train

<p>man, it is claimed, of considerable experience. With
</p>
<p>him was General Superintendent Besler, who acted as
</p>
<p>pilot along the road. The train was the heaviest that
</p>
<p>had left this city since the strike was inaugurated, and
</p>
<p>consisted of three coaches, two sleepers, two postal,
</p>
<p>and an express and baggage cars. The point men-
</p>
<p>tioned is about four miles west of Princeton, and
</p>
<p>three miles east of Wyanet. At this part of the road
</p>
<p>there is a bridge across a creek, the trestle upon
</p>
<p>which it is erected being ninety-six feet high. Up to
</p>
<p>near the bridge and east of it the road is double-
</p>
<p>tracked, but there is only a single track across the
</p>
<p>bridge. In order, however to prevent collisions, the
</p>
<p>road has laid automatic switches at each approach, so
</p>
<p>that if trains come in opposite directions, the one at
</p>
<p>the east approach will be thrown from the main track
</p>
<p>and on to a short spur, which at this point, runs a
</p>
<p>short distance into a dense piece of woods. When the
</p>
<p>train was approaching this bridge, it w r as running at
</p>
<p>the rate of forty-five miles an hour. Suddenlv the lo-
</p>
<p>comotive gave a lurch and the clerks in the postal cars
</p>
<p>were thrown on their faces by the jar caused by the
</p>
<p>rapid and sudden turning from the main line on the
</p>
<p>spur. The bank of the creek is very high, and a
</p>
<p>calamity was threatened bv the train being thrown
</p>
<p>over the precipice, as the cars rocked heavily from
</p>
<p>side to side. General Superintendent Besler seized
</p>
<p>the lever, whistled down brakes and reversed the en-
</p>
<p>gine. There was no train coming in an opposite
</p>
<p>direction at the time, but it was by only a miracle that
</p>
<p>a fearful calamity was averted. The postal clerks in-

<p>sist that the accident was due to the incompetency of

</p>
<p>the engineer, who had no business to run at such fear-
</p>
<p>ful speed when approaching the bridge, and had he
</p>
<p>been running at the ordinary rate of speed  twenty
</p>
<p>miles an hour  the train would not have left the
</p>
<p>track." 1
</p>
<p>" At Council Bluffs, Iowa, a petition signed by all
</p>
<p>the mail clerks on the Iowa division of the Burlington
</p>
<p>will be sent to Washington to-morrow, asking F. E.
</p>
<p>Nash, general superintendent of railway mail service,
</p>
<p>to have the government compel the road to put com-
</p>
<p>petent engineers on the mail trains." '-'
</p>
<p>Yet, regardless of all risk to patrons, employes and
</p>
<p>propertv, Press Agent Morton said: "The Iowa divis-
</p>
<p>ional superintendent telegraphs that twenty freight
</p>
<p>trains are running there to-day, and a few freights are
</p>
<p>running on most of the other divisions. Two freight
</p>
<p>trains loaded with coal left Streator this morning for
</p>
<p>local points. Everything along the system is quiet,
</p>
<p>and the companv's property is well protected."

<p>" How much will the strike cost the Burlington

<p>company? "
</p>
<p>"The company doesn't know and doesn't care." -
</p>
<p>Neither did they care what kind of men the}' em-
</p>
<p>ployed, and as hundreds of men presented themselves,
</p>
<p>Messrs. Arthur and Sargent concluded that some other
</p>
<p>steps must be taken beyond an effort to keep these
</p>
<p>men away. Thousands of dollars had been paid out
</p>
<p>all along the line in this effort, and the more men they
</p>
<p>induced to leave the more came to rind work, or to sell
</p>
<p>themselves to the strikers. The situation looked seri-
</p>
<p>ous and perplexing. Other companies were evidently

<p>helping the Burlington. The men who came to take

</p>
<p>the strikers' places said they came on passes furnished
</p>
<p>by the Burlington agents. Burlington tickets were
</p>
<p>said to have been honored by other roads, because of
</p>
<p>the Burlington's inability to transport the passengers
</p>
<p>after selling the tickets: and direct charges were made
</p>
<p>that the Burlington freight business was being hand-
</p>
<p>led by other roads. The grievance committees from
</p>
<p>the various systems centering in Chicago, were asking
</p>
<p>for advice about transfers, and they were told by
</p>
<p>Messrs. Arthur and Sargent, " Do not handle Burling-
</p>
<p>ton cars."
</p>
<p>The order created much uneasiness among general
</p>
<p>managers of other roads. It brought many of them
</p>
<p>to the Grand Pacific to consult with the Brotherhood
</p>
<p>leaders. There were so many parties seeking advice
</p>
<p>as to duties, that it was deemed best to call in the
</p>
<p>grievance committees, and on March 2. 1888, the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing order was issued to the chairman of the gen-
</p>
<p>eral grievance committee of the Brotherhood of Loco-
</p>
<p>motive Engineers and Firemen on the railroads center-
</p>
<p>ing in Chicago.
</p>

</p>
<p>L. E. and F.  Dear Sir and Brother: You are
</p>
<p>hereby authorized and ordered to come to the city of

<p>Chicago at once and report at the headquarters.
</p>
<p>There are many important matters to consider in con-
</p>
<p>nection with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy

<p>This order was sent to the chairman of the commit-
</p>
<p>tees on the following roads:
</p>
<p>Chicago & Alton; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific;
</p>
<p>Missouri Pacific; Wabash; Burlington, Cedar Rapids

<p>Minnesota & North-Western; Chicago & Eastern Illi-

<p>nois; Chicago & Atlantic; St. Paul, Minneapolis &

<p>Manitoba; and Chicago & Grand Trunk.
</p>
<p>In the meantime large union meetings were held
</p>
<p>throughout the country. At New York city strong
</p>
<p>resolutions were passed against other railroads assisting
</p>
<p>the Burlington, and also strongly approving of the
</p>
<p>strike and offering Financial support. At St. Paul, two
</p>
<p>hundred and fifty members of divisions 150 and 369,
</p>
<p>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, passed resolu-
</p>
<p>tions in hearty sympathy with the strike, and guaran-
</p>
<p>teed their financial assistance, and ordered one thou-
</p>
<p>sand dollars sent to Chicago. At LaFayette, Indiana^
</p>
<p>the following resolution was adopted and sent to P. M.

<p>Arthur, Grand Chief Engineer: : ' Our sympathies

<p>are with you and the enginemen of the Burlington.

<p>a telegram sent to Chief Arthur urging the strikers to
</p>
<p>286 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>stand firm, that the members of that division were
</p>
<p>ready to meet any demands that might be made upon
</p>
<p>them. From all over the country came assurances of
</p>
<p>loyalty to the Brotherhoods and liberality in furnishing
</p>
<p>money that was astonishing. There were many in-
</p>
<p>stances of members tendering their whole month's sal-
</p>
<p>ary, and many men, who were not members of either
</p>
<p>organization, gave their money freely, vacating their
</p>
<p>places as readily as the members. It was the prevail-
</p>
<p>ing opinion among laboring men, that the Burlington
</p>
<p>had been chosen as the battle field between capital
</p>
<p>and labor, and that companies other than the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton were equally interested in the outcome. And al-
</p>
<p>most a unit was secured of the responsible, thinking
</p>
<p>laborers, in working for a common cause regardless
</p>
<p>of personal pique. With this vast army, loyal to the
</p>
<p>common interests of labor, sending heart-cheering
</p>
<p>words and money, good fellowship and good wishes,
</p>
<p>the way seemed clear, and the time auspicious, for a
</p>
<p>test of whether labor, numbering thousands, should
</p>
<p>have a voice equal to one in fixing the price of its pro-
</p>
<p>duct. Under these circumstances the committees
</p>
<p>which had been called bv the order of March 2, bv
</p>
<p>the grand officers, arrived in Chicago on March 5,
</p>
<p>1888, and held the most important meeting of the
</p>
<p>year. They held within their grasp greater possi-
</p>
<p>bilities than any other. They had the power and
</p>
<p>voted to use it, which no other meeting within my
</p>
<p>knowledge had.
</p>
<p>This meeting was held in secret session, or was so
</p>
<p>intended by the participants. But there must have

</p>
<p>been a black-sheep among them, moved by some
</p>
<p>RULE OR RUIN. 287
</p>
<p>other motive than the good of the order, who gave to
</p>
<p>the Chicago Tribune a verbatim report of the reso-
</p>
<p>lutions passed which were as follows: "Resolved:
</p>
<p>That the chairman of each system here represented,
</p>
<p>go home, convene his local committee, call on the offi-
</p>
<p>cers and notify them that the engineers and firemen
</p>
<p>will not handle Burlington cars or traffic of any kind."
</p>
<p>"Also that the men are to be instructed by the chair-
</p>
<p>man of the grievance committee of each road, that
</p>
<p>if a Burlington car, or any freight, shall be put upon
</p>
<p>them they will refuse to handle it, and if they are
</p>
<p>compelled by the company to do so, they will still re-
</p>
<p>fuse, and if they are discharged, then the engineers
</p>
<p>and firemen on the system will strike." Messrs.
</p>
<p>Arthur and Sargent were asked if they would sanction
</p>
<p>a strike under such circumstances and the answer was,
</p>
<p>"In war times we must adopt war measures. We
</p>
<p>will give our sanction."
</p>
<p>Here was a power that was almost unlimited, but it
</p>
<p>was a negative force, so far as the officers were con-
</p>
<p>cerned and was not available, only so far as the men
</p>
<p>themselves would vote to adopt the measures suggest-
</p>
<p>ed by their chairman. These measures might be sanc-
</p>
<p>tioned, but could not be ordered by the grand officers,
</p>
<p>so that upon the union of sentiment depended all this
</p>
<p>power. When the resolution to boycott Burlington
</p>
<p>cars was adopted, the seed of discord was sown. In
</p>
<p>war, there is a vast difference between supporting the
</p>
<p>line of battle and being in the line of battle itself. It
</p>
<p>was so in the Burlington fight; it was found there is a
</p>
<p>vast difference between passing resolutions to sustain

<p>the Burlington strikers, and voting themselves into a
</p>
<p>288 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>position that might plunge them into a strike them-
</p>
<p>selves.
</p>
<p>These committeemen left for their homes to follow
</p>
<p>out the instructions contained in the resolutions. Up-
</p>
<p>on one road there was found a minority, who, when
</p>
<p>put to the test, were found on the safe side. They went
</p>
<p>to the general manager and told him they would hand-
</p>
<p>le Burlington cars. This general manager had said
</p>
<p>that he would not try to handle Burlington cars as long
</p>
<p>as the other roads did not. In taking this action, and
</p>
<p>notifying the managers what they would do if they
</p>
<p>compelled the enginemen to handle Burlington busi-
</p>
<p>ness, they only wished to go to that extent that the doors
</p>
<p>of their respective roads would be closed against Bur-
</p>
<p>lington business. This could not be done without tak-
</p>
<p>ing the chances of rinding some general manager who
</p>
<p>would demand that the men choose between handling
</p>
<p>any business offered them, and quitting. It was a
</p>
<p>critical test, yet it was the only means by which they
</p>
<p>could expect to succeed in boycotting the Burlington.
</p>
<p>It left the general managers to decide whether they
</p>
<p>would have a strike or not. If the men on all the lines
</p>
<p>had shown a positive determination not to handle Bur-
</p>
<p>lington cars, and if there had been no weakness shown
</p>
<p>at any point, it is reasonable to suppose that none of
</p>
<p>the managers would have made the demand which
</p>
<p>would have closed their road by a strike. The grand
</p>
<p>officers, and other leaders of the Brotherhoods, believed
</p>
<p>this move would have a powerful influence on the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington, and they were willing to await developments,
</p>
<p>believing the men, without an exception, would prove

</p>
<p>While the leaders of the strike are waiting for develop-
</p>
<p>ments, let us look at the situation along the line of the
</p>
<p>Burlington. . .
</p>
<p>The Burlington officials were giving the public to
</p>
<p>understand that they were getting all the men they
</p>
<p>wanted, and that the quality was equal to the old men,
</p>
<p>but from certain letters received at the strikers' head-
</p>
<p>quarters it would appear that the Burlington company
</p>
<p>was not having things all its own way securing engi-
</p>
<p>neers. The following letter sent by Master Mechanic
</p>
<p>R. W. Colville, of Galesburg, 111., to one of its former
</p>
<p>engineers, discharged five years ago for alleged in-
</p>
<p>competency, is self-explanatory. The name is pur-
</p>
<p>posely suppressed, but the engineer's present address is
</p>
<p>Racine, Wis. :
</p>
<p>Dear Sir : You are, of course, aware ere this of the
</p>
<p>situation on the 'Q' system, brought about by the de-
</p>
<p>mands of the engineers' and firemen's brotherhoods.
</p>
<p>Are you willing to come back to Galesburg at once
</p>
<p>and aid the company during this temporary trouble by
</p>
<p>service as a locomotive engineer? I will give you my
</p>
<p>positive assurance that if you do come, all of tl'e past
</p>
<p>will be overlooked by the company, and your action
</p>
<p>in rendering assistance at this time will be remembered
</p>
<p>by the management. Furthermore, your position here
</p>
<p>after the end of this trouble will be a permanant one,
</p>
<p>and one which will give you no cause or reason to re-
</p>
<p>gret leaving your present one. Please wire me at
</p>
<p>once on receipt of this if you will come, and if so,

<p>"Brookfield, Missouri, March 2. The usual

<p>day passenger trains have gone through, carrying pas-
</p>
<p>sengers and express and mail, though somewhat out
</p>
<p>of time. The efforts of the strikers are mainly put
</p>
<p>forth to induce the men who come to take their places,
</p>
<p>to quit. In this they have partially succeeded, buying
</p>
<p>off some, and scaring off others, but careful surveillance
</p>
<p>is kept by the officials, and thus far no train has been
</p>
<p>delayed here. Last evening one freight was sent

</p>
<p>in the ability of the company to master the situation is
</p>
<p>somewhat strengthened by the movements of trains,

</p>
<p>inability to make time. There was a rumor of acts
</p>
<p>of petty lawlessness by which it was sought to
</p>
<p>endanger travel, but none have occurred here, and it

<p>centering here are reaping a harvest. The Brother-
</p>
<p>hoods have been diligently at work on the new men
</p>
<p>making converts. A number of them were in the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood's hall and announced their intention of
</p>
<p>returning home. They said they were promised $4 a
</p>
<p>day to come, but they found that the company would
</p>
<p>put them on their graded rates which only pay $2.25
</p>
<p>a day. The same class of work they declared paid
</p>
<p>$3.10 a day on eastern roads. A Reading Knight of
</p>
<p>Labor, engineer, made a speech in the hall, and said
</p>
<p>that their coming west was a mistake. He thought
</p>
<p>the railroads were using both the Brotherhoods and

<p>the Knights of Labor to destrov each other."

<p>with a cheer. He was given some money and then

</p>
<p>Denver, Colorado, March 6. In addition to the
</p>
<p>single passenger train, in and out to da)-, the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington sent two freight trains east, and one freight
</p>
<p>train is expected to arrive. Freight is being received
</p>
<p>for local points, but shippers invariably send by other
</p>
<p>routes anything destined for common points. The
</p>
<p>mayor has taken offense at the presence of deputy
</p>
<p>sheriffs who are doing police duty about the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton yards. He declares that the city police are equal
</p>
<p>to all demands. The strikers are conducting them-
</p>
<p>selves in the same orderly manner as they have done
</p>
<p>from the outset." 1
</p>
<p>The Burlington had great appearance of success in
</p>
<p>manning their engines: they had gathered a large
</p>
<p>number of engineers such as they were, and they
</p>
<p>were putting the best face possible on their side of the
</p>
<p>story. They were indifferent as to the cost or the
</p>
<p>destruction of property; the road was lined with dep-
</p>
<p>uty sheriffs and Pinkerton detectives, evidently with-
</p>
<p>out consent or pre-arrangement of local authorities.
</p>
<p>While their facilities were improving, their business
</p>
<p>was going to other companies: their losses and in-
</p>
<p>creased expenses were enormous. Even the great

<p>military display did not deter the strikers from solic-
</p>
<p>iting their new men. The company built places for

<p>CHAPTER XLII.
</p>
<p>THE STRIKE, IN CONGRESS AND IN COURT.
</p>
<p>In Congress March 5, 1888, representative White,
</p>
<p>of Indiana, had offered the following:
</p>
<p>"Whereas: There has been inaugurated a great
</p>
<p>strike on the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
</p>
<p>railroad, which, if not speedily checked, will end in
</p>
<p>wide spread disaster and suffering, not only to those
</p>
<p>immediately engaged in it, but to others who are not
</p>
<p>directly connected therewith, yet nevertheless, are
</p>
<p>greatly affected by the prolongation of said strike;
</p>
<p>Resolved: That a special committee of five be ap-
</p>
<p>pointed by the speaker, to proceed at once to Chicago
</p>
<p>and there investigate the conditions, and that they be
</p>
<p>empowered and requested to act as mediators between
</p>
<p>the Burlington and Chief Arthur, and bring about a
</p>
<p>settlement of the pending trouble and difference which
</p>
<p>will be amicable and agreeable to both parties, so that
</p>
<p>the strike will terminate. Referred to committee on
</p>
<p>commerce."
</p>
<p>The Burlington had, before the strike, reduced rates
</p>
<p>for freight below reason, to compel other lines to do
</p>
<p>their bidding. Reductions in the freight tariff began
</p>
<p>to occur for other reasons. On March 2, Chairman
</p>
<p>Midgeley was notified of a tariff reduction on packing
</p>
<p>house products from Missouri river points to Chicago,
</p>
<p>to ten cents per one hundred pounds, to hold its

</p>
<p>business. Yet Press Agent Morton said, when asked
</p>
<p>THE STRIKE, IN CONGRESS AND IN COURT. 297
</p>
<p>about the situation, " We are running forty-seven
</p>
<p>passenger trains and one hundred and one freight
</p>
<p>trains on the Iowa division, and on the Illinois division
</p>
<p>we are running more trains than in Iowa. All around
</p>
<p>we are doing quite well. Everything is lovely and
</p>
<p>the goose hangs high." '
</p>
<p>It will not be questioned that the Burlington's news
</p>
<p>dispenser was equal to his task. While he is giving
</p>
<p>such a charming picture of the situation, the Chicago
</p>
<p>Tribune of the same date, March 7, had a review of
</p>
<p>affairs, of a contrasted hue :
</p>
<p>" The boycott on the Burlington is almost complete,
</p>
<p>so far as the western roads are concerned. At all
</p>
<p>junctions along the line of the Burlington may be
</p>
<p>found long rows of cars, delivered by the company to
</p>
<p>roads that will not move them from the place where
</p>
<p>thev have been left by the non-brotherhood crews.
</p>
<p>The Chicago & North-Western had hundreds of cars
</p>
<p>lying in its various yards consigned to points on the
</p>
<p>Burlington, while the Burlington has hundreds of cars
</p>
<p>that the Chicago & North- Western will not accept and
</p>
<p>forward to points of destination. The same is true of
</p>
<p>the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul: the Chicago &
</p>
<p>Alton; the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific; the Santa
</p>
<p>Fe; the Eastern Illinois; the Illinois Central: and the
</p>
<p>Wabash. The officials of the Alton, Rock Island,
</p>
<p>Northwestern, Wabash, and other roads, admit that
</p>
<p>thev had agreed to refuse to handle Burlington traffic.
</p>
<p>Thev said they could not afford to do otherwise, as the
</p>
<p>loss to them from stoppage of their business would be
</p>
<p>immense. One of them said he could not see why his
</p>
<p>road should allow itself to become involved in the

</p>
<p>strike, simply to help out the Burlington. When the
</p>
<p>western roads lately tried to restore rates to a paying
</p>
<p>basis, the Burlington objected. It paid no considera-
</p>
<p>tion to the desires of its competitors then, and there is
</p>
<p>no reason why the latter should show any consideration
</p>
<p>to the Burlington now. ' Self-preservation,' he said,
</p>
<p>'was the first duty of his road, and he meant to act up-
</p>
<p>on that principal.'"
</p>
<p>While it was evidently the desire of all the other
</p>
<p>managers to keep out of the fight, the Burlington
</p>
<p>management was bound to bring them into it. They
</p>
<p>have never been very considerate of anv one's inter-
</p>
<p>est but their own. A writer in the Aurora Daily
</p>
<p>Express says : " When the Burlington gets on the
</p>
<p>defensive, and is weak in the knees, it piously turns to
</p>
<p>the law. When the Burlington has anv scheme to
</p>
<p>carry out in utter defiance of law, then, the law be "
</p>
<p>They were hemmed in on all sides at this time, and
</p>
<p>at once instituted legal proceedings to compel compli-
</p>
<p>ance with the inter-state commerce law. They chose
</p>
<p>the Wabash, as that was in the hands of the United
</p>
<p>States court under General McNulta. Assistant Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Passenger Agent Wakely said: "The fight be-
</p>
<p>tween the Burlington and the strikers is over. We
</p>
<p>have won the battle and can now take a rest and look
</p>
<p>on, while Chief Arthur and his hosts tackle the other
</p>
<p>fellows. We have stood the brunt of the shock, and
</p>
<p>set the pace for our competitors to follow. I see that
</p>
<p>some of them hesitate about showing fight, and seem
</p>
<p>to lack that amount of sand necessary for a good sol
</p>
<p>dier. I am of the opinion that the strikers are playing

<p>foolishness when the railroad companies take the
</p>
<p>decided stand they must assume sooner or later.'" :
</p>
<p>The smile of assurance that accompanied this declara-
</p>
<p>tion would no doubt have faded, had he been able to
</p>
<p>see further into the future. The Burlington had an
</p>
<p>opportunity to make the declaration that " the strike
</p>
<p>was off," many times before it really was, and contin-
</p>
<p>ued to feel the power of the "bluff" many months.
</p>
<p>The Grand Pacific hotel, of Chicago, is the official
</p>
<p>centerof all roads entering Chicago, and in the build-
</p>
<p>ing was located the strikers' headquarters. Messrs.
</p>
<p>Arthur and Sargent were both there and also
</p>
<p>Messrs. Hoge and Murphy, the chairmen of the engi-
</p>
<p>neer's and firemen's committee. In the immense
</p>
<p>rotunda could be seen the greatest activity. Men were
</p>
<p>hurrying through the crowd, type writers with nimble
</p>
<p>fingers were weaving the thread of information, or
</p>
<p>instruction, and the electric current was kept busv with
</p>
<p>messages, in and out. It had the appearance of a
</p>
<p>great national caucus. The strikers' headquarters
</p>
<p>were no less active. Men representing roads in all
</p>
<p>parts of the country, came for advice, eager to lend a
</p>
<p>helping hand; proffers of money, votes of confidence,
</p>
<p>and gratuitous advice came on wings.
</p>
<p>While the Burlington had only their own road to
</p>
<p>watch, Arthur and Sargent must watch and direct all
</p>
<p>roads, and at this time, March 6, nothing but united,
</p>
<p>unselfish devotion to the cause of the two Brother-
</p>
<p>hoods could be expected to win the battle. The Bur-
</p>
<p>lington were finding substitutes. So the boycott had
</p>
<p>been decided on as the most powerful weapon, but to

<p>use this successfully the most absolute loyalty was

<p>necessary. Realizing this, every indication of a break
</p>
<p>far or near, in the solidity of the line of boycott which
</p>
<p>surrounded the Burlington, brought with it an unpleas-
</p>
<p>ant realization that the chief and grand master of the
</p>
<p>two Brotherhoods lacked the power to order and
</p>
<p>compel. They must depend for obedience upon that
</p>
<p>slender thread in human nature  honor.
</p>
<p>With this feeling uppermost in their minds, the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing telegram was received from Kansas City,
</p>
<p>nearly 500 miles away: "Grand Chief P. M. Arthur:
</p>
<p>Complications may arise at anv time, making the
</p>
<p>counsel and presence of Grand Organizer S. M. Ste-
</p>
<p>vens necessary. Answer quick. J. C. Murray."'
</p>
<p>This request was complied with, and Mr Stevens
</p>
<p>assigned to duty. Shortly another one was received
</p>
<p>addressed to the Grand Chief: " Kansas City, Mis-
</p>
<p>souri : Roads centering here are violating pledges not
</p>
<p>to handle Burlington business. The men feel that the
</p>
<p>time has come to act.' J. C. M
</p>
<p>The fear of hasty action added to other combina-
</p>
<p>tions, m ade the situation anything but pleasant at head-
</p>
<p>quarters, and Kansas City being the terminal point of
</p>
<p>some twenty-five thousand miles of railroad, they
</p>
<p>would naturally experience much anxiety. This was
</p>
<p>naturally increased by the receipt of another telegram
</p>
<p>from Kansas City, Missouri, March 6, at 3:00 p. m.,
</p>
<p>addressed to Messrs. Arthur and Sargent: " All the
</p>
<p>roads centering here have broken agreement with our
</p>
<p>comm ittee of engineers and firemen. Are waiting
</p>
<p>your answer. Local Committee."
</p>
<p>To this the grand chief answered: "Send your

<p>Union meetings were being held in Kansas City,
</p>
<p>composed of men from the Union Pacific ; Fort Scott
</p>
<p>& Gulf; Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe; Chicago,
</p>
<p>Rock Island & Pacific; Southern Kansas; Wabash;
</p>
<p>Western & Missouri Pacific and others. Many of the
</p>
<p>chairmen of these lines were there, yet it was hard to
</p>
<p>tell what might happen, and from that time on the ex-
</p>
<p>citement among the men, who visited headquarters,
</p>
<p>ran high.
</p>
<p>Beside these complications, the grand officers had
</p>
<p>been warned by their legal counsel, Mr. Alexander
</p>
<p>Sullivan, of the conspiracy law of Illinois. Under that
</p>
<p>law it was supposed that the liberty of the leaders
</p>
<p>would be endangered if they should give instructions
</p>
<p>for any combined action.
</p>
<p>This law reads as follows:

<p>CHAPTER XLIII.
</p>
<p>BURLINGTON & NORTHERN STRIKE.
</p>
<p>The Chicago, Burlington & Northern railroad was
</p>
<p>built in 1886 in the interest of the Burlington road.
</p>
<p>This road connects with the Burlington system proper
</p>
<p>at Oregon, 111., and runs to St. Paul, a distance of 232
</p>
<p>miles. It was, however, managed as a separate hold-
</p>
<p>ing, but as a feeder for the Burlington. The men em-
</p>
<p>ployed upon it felt that they were jeopardizing the
</p>
<p>interests of their striking Burlington brothers, by
</p>
<p>handling business directly in the interest of the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington road. They were urged to stop this traffic.
</p>
<p>In this effort the committee called on the officers, on
</p>
<p>Sunday, March 4, and demanded that it be stopped or
</p>
<p>they would strike at seven o'clock the following even-
</p>
<p>ing. But it is evident that there was a want of agree-
</p>
<p>ment among the men as to the necessity of such a
</p>
<p>step, and they afterwards informed the officers that
</p>
<p>they would remain at work. But the next day, the
</p>
<p>meeting in Chicago of all the chairmen of grievance
</p>
<p>committees having passed the resolution to boycott,
</p>
<p>the)- made an effort again with more unanimity. The
</p>
<p>engineers and firemen located at La Crosse, on the
</p>
<p>Chicago, Burlington & Northern road, presented their
</p>
<p>ultimatum in the following letter:
</p>
<p>La Crosse, Wis., March 6, 1888.
</p>
<p>To General Superintendent Barr,

<p>Chicago, Burlington & Northern railroad.
</p>
<p>burlington & northern strike. 305
</p>
<p>"Dear Sir:
</p>
<p>The engineers and firemen of your railroad com-
</p>
<p>pany respectfully request that after 10 o'clock a. m.,
</p>
<p>Wednesday, March 7, you do not ask them to handle
</p>
<p>any business, either passenger or freight, or any con-
</p>
<p>signment in the interest of the Chicago, Burlington &
</p>
<p>Quincy railroad. Such a step will not be consistent
</p>
<p>with the present good will which exists between your
</p>
<p>company and its engineers and firemen.'' An answer
</p>
<p>was expected to this by seven o'clock the next morn-
</p>
<p>ing. 1
</p>
<p>On receiving this document, Mr. Barr immediately
</p>
<p>transmitted it to General Manager Harris, of the
</p>
<p>Chicago, Burlington & Northern, who answered at
</p>
<p>once, saying: "It is useless to propose that the Chica-
</p>
<p>go, Burlington & Northern road surrender the con-
</p>
<p>trol of its affairs, or that it be subjected to the dicta-
</p>
<p>tion of its employes. If any of the engineers or fire-
</p>
<p>men do not like the company's method of doing busi-
</p>
<p>ness, give them their time checks, and post such
</p>
<p>notices as you may deem proper for the direction of
</p>
<p>the employes." '
</p>
<p>A strike was not what these men wanted. Their
</p>
<p>pay was satisfactory and they only wished to boycott
</p>
<p>the Burlington, but when they hesitated the second
</p>
<p>time, pressure was brought to bear on them from the
</p>
<p>leaders in Chicago, and at 10:00 a. m., on the 8th,
</p>
<p>the engines were abandoned, except those which
</p>
<p>were on the road. These were run to the end of
</p>
<p>their divisions, as had been done a week before on the
</p>
<p>Burlington. - In this move there was an evident lack
</p>
<p>of generalship. It is known that the enginemen in

<p>306 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>the vicinity of this line in their eagerness to cripple the
</p>
<p>Burlington had clamored for this movement, yet the
</p>
<p>leaders should have been ready with definite plans
</p>
<p>educed from mature deliberation as to the importance
</p>
<p>of this line to the Burlington.
</p>
<p>This road belonged in part to the Burlington and
</p>
<p>had no outlet to the south except the Burlington, while
</p>
<p>the north end was hedged in by the boycott, so that
</p>
<p>they could not have had much business at best. The
</p>
<p>Burlington was its recruiting ground for men to take
</p>
<p>their places and when the old men stepped down the
</p>
<p>new stepped up. It was a grand spectacle of loyalty;
</p>
<p>no doubt the leaders believed it was necessary, and all
</p>
<p>were readv with all the power they possessed, and by
</p>
<p>any sacrifice, to help the cause. But the result was
</p>
<p>more disastrous than beneficial, because every step of
</p>
<p>this kind, which did not carry with it success, weak-
</p>
<p>ened hundreds of other men whose loyalty and co-op-
</p>
<p>eration were essential to success. General Manager
</p>
<p>Harris had stated his position; that the only result of a
</p>
<p>demand to boycott would be that the men would
</p>
<p>lose their places. A boycott to the Chicago, Burling-
</p>
<p>ton & Northern meant the suspension of business en-
</p>
<p>tirely, and there was consequently no choice for Mr.
</p>
<p>Harris.
</p>
<p>The wisdom of making the demand, in view of that
</p>
<p>road's surroundings, is at this distance very doubtful
</p>
<p>and can onlv be measured bv the result. Every fail-
</p>
<p>ure of success, in whatever method or direction made,
</p>
<p>was far-reaching in its effect. When we remember
</p>
<p>that there was no power to compel, but every man

<p>was his own master, and that each voted to do, or not

</p>
<p>to do, we can appreciate the damage done by the
</p>
<p>weakening influence it exercised on those already-
</p>
<p>weak, and the effect upon other lines in producing
</p>
<p>that lack of harmony so essential to success.
</p>
<p>The movement in the direction of a general boycott
</p>
<p>called forth unpleasant criticism in the newspapers,
</p>
<p>and caused the following circular letter to be sent out
</p>
<p>from the strikers' headquarters.
</p>
<p>"To the public: Owing to the reports that are be-
</p>
<p>ing circulated in regard to the attitude of the locomo-
</p>
<p>tive engineers in the present strike, and there being a
</p>
<p>tendency on the part of the press to endorse the stand
</p>
<p>taken by the railroad company, we deem it necessary
</p>
<p>in our own behalf to state that the two organizations
</p>
<p>which are engaged in the present trouble are com-
</p>
<p>posed of conservative men, and they are ready and
</p>
<p>willing now, and have ever been, to meet the officers
</p>
<p>of the Burlington railroad and arbitrate the questions
</p>
<p>in dispute. The Brotherhoods are not only willing to do
</p>
<p>this through their executive officers, but are also will-
</p>
<p>ing to place the whole matter in the hands of three
</p>
<p>railroad managers and abide by their decision.
</p>
<p>"Now, in all candor, we would ask any honest,
</p>
<p>thinking citizen, whether the organizations mentioned
</p>
<p>can do more and maintain their constitutional privi-
</p>
<p>leges? If this trouble shall continue, and the public at
</p>
<p>large shall suffer on account of the same, the blame
</p>
<p>must rest where it belongs, and that is upon the par-
</p>
<p>ties who refuse to arbitrate."
</p>
<p>(Signed) The Brotherhoods.

<p>half way," and when asked what he would consider a
</p>
<p>fair arbitration committee, said, " Any three general
</p>
<p>managers of the roads running out of Chicago. I
</p>
<p>mention railroad men because they understand the
</p>
<p>situation better than any one else, and I agree, on be-
</p>
<p>half of the Brotherhood, to abide by the decision of
</p>
<p>such an arbitration committee." '
</p>
<p>On this subject Mr. Paul Morton, for the Burlington
</p>
<p>said: "There is considerable talk about arbitration,
</p>
<p>but it all comes from men outside of our employ, who
</p>
<p>evidently desire to go to work again. These men
</p>
<p>can return to work when they accede to our terms." '
</p>
<p>The extent of the strike, che feeling and activity
</p>
<p>displayed by the strikers and all those in sympathy,
</p>
<p>portended insurmountable difficulties to railroads and
</p>
<p>to commerce, and they called forth many articles on
</p>
<p>arbitration. The Aurora Daily Ex-press said: "The
</p>
<p>present condition of things cannot last long in this
</p>
<p>country. The public, through whose consent such
</p>
<p>corporations are organized and permitted to exist, have
</p>
<p>rights which must be respected. The railroads should
</p>
<p>be, by law, compelled to arbitrate when honest differ-
</p>
<p>ences arise between them and their employes. This
</p>
<p>can be done quietly and without a suspension of busi-
</p>
<p>ness. The great body of working men in this country,
</p>
<p>thanks to the best government under the sun, are very
</p>
<p>intelligent and law abiding, and would accept such de-
</p>
<p>cision. The railroad companies, if they want the
</p>
<p>candid judgment of the public, must learn to respect
</p>
<p>the rights of the people, and to obey the law. The*se
</p>
<p>are things to which they pay very little attention
</p>
<p>where they affect their interests unfavorably." '

<p>BURLINGTON & NORTHERN STRIKE. 309
</p>
<p>The Creston Advertiser believes that "In the main
</p>
<p>the principles for which the Brotherhoods are striving
</p>
<p>are just and equitable, and hopes that by concessions
</p>
<p>or compromise on conditions of les r importance, they
</p>
<p>gain the abolishment of the classification system, which
</p>
<p>is the cause of so many evils and so much injustice in
</p>
<p>the service, and that the mileage system may be estab-
</p>
<p>lished as the most equitable manner of compensation.
</p>
<p>If the mileage asked for is too high, surely there should
</p>
<p>be no trouble in coming to a compromise basis by ar-
</p>
<p>bitration. The side that refuses to submit to this
</p>
<p>means of settlement for the benefit of the public, should
</p>
<p>be visited by the merited condemnation of the
</p>
<p>people/'
</p>
<p>The strike and kindred topics were fruitful and
</p>
<p>frequent subjects of discussion in all the leading periodi-
</p>
<p>cals of the country, but the Burlington, regardless of
</p>
<p>any interest or of public opinion, bent upon gratifying
</p>
<p>their own magnified official powers and rights, worked
</p>
<p>under the motto: - ; Rule or ruin;"' and, to drive other
</p>
<p>roads into the right, went into court. Mr. Morton's
</p>
<p>assistant, Mr. Wakely, said: " The Burlington will at
</p>
<p>once institute legal proceedings to force other roads to
</p>
<p>receive and forward freight. It is claimed upon good
</p>
<p>authority that several of the roads now hesitating about
</p>
<p>handling Burlington freight, are only waiting for an
</p>
<p>order from the court compelling them to do so. Such
</p>
<p>an order would give them an excuse which the strikers
</p>
<p>could hardly afford to ignore. In the event of a gen-
</p>
<p>eral strike following this enforced acceptance of the
</p>
<p>Burlington freight by the competing roads, that corn-

<p>pan v would have far the best of it. A general strike
</p>
<p>3IO THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>would completely paralyze the through freight traffic,
</p>
<p>but this would cut little figure with the Burlington. It
</p>
<p>is now in a position to handle an immense amount of
</p>
<p>business and is waiting for that business. A general
</p>
<p>strike would mass upon this road the entire local freight
</p>
<p>of six states.
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>"It would be impossible for any of the great roads,
</p>
<p>like the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, Rock Island
</p>
<p>& Pacific, or the Wabash, to fill all the places of their
</p>
<p>engineers for weeks, perhaps for months to come.
</p>
<p>During all this time the Burlington would be in do-
</p>
<p>er, and would regain all that it had lost. This is why
</p>
<p>the Burlington officials, from President Perkins down,
</p>
<p>smile, when told that a general strike is possible."
</p>
<p>Mr. Paul Morton was asked: "In case of a general
</p>
<p>strike being ordered, would any influence brought to
</p>
<p>bear upon their road by these companies crippled by

<p>such a strike, have the effect of forcing you to concede

</p>
<p>phatically, no." '

<p>CHAPTER XLIV.
</p>
<p>THE BURLINGTON IN COURT.
</p>
<p>To enforce the policy which the Burlington had
</p>
<p>adopted towards other roads, action was brought
</p>
<p>against the Wabash, St. Louis ,& Pacific, in Judge
</p>
<p>Gresham's court to which General John NcNulta as re-
</p>
<p>ceiver of the Wabash, owes his authority. "Interven-
</p>
<p>ing petitions were tiled in the names of Charles 11.
</p>
<p>Beers, the lumberman, etal.,and D. E. Richardson the
</p>
<p>grain man, who has an elevator at the intersection of
</p>
<p>the Burlington tracks and Western avenue. Specific
</p>
<p>incidents are mentioned in each, but the relief sought
</p>
<p>by both is identical. Judge Gresham was asked to re-
</p>
<p>quire Receiver McNulta to handle the freight of the
</p>
<p>Burlington, and if it be found that his failure to do so
</p>
<p>thus far has been the result of an improper influence
</p>
<p>by Chief Arthur of the Brotherhood of Engineers,
</p>
<p>that he be ordered to show cause why he should not
</p>
<p>be punished for contempt of court, in interfering with
</p>
<p>the management and operation of the railroad in the
</p>
<p>control of the United States court. General Manager
</p>
<p>Stone made the allegations on behalf of the petitioners
</p>
<p>through Mr. Wirt Dexter, solicitor of the Burlington
</p>
<p>company. Then follows a long recitation of the com-
</p>
<p>plaint. The fifth paragraph of the petition says, that
</p>
<p>"the refusal of the agent was due to the direct orders
</p>
<p>of the receiver, and that when the receiver was called

</p>
<p>upon for a reason for his action, he said it was because
</p>
<p>^12 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>his men had threatened to strike if asked to haul
</p>
<p>Burlington cars. This refusal of the receiver to
</p>
<p>handle Burlington freight is described as an unusual
</p>
<p>discrimination, and Chief Arthur as the head of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood, is alleged to have brought about the
</p>
<p>receiver's action by duress. Under the prevailing cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances it is alleged that the Wabash road is de-
</p>
<p>prived of a large source of revenue, and its employes
</p>
<p>made liable to line and imprisonment for wanton and
</p>
<p>malicious discrimination against the property of the
</p>
<p>petitioners. Judge Gresham looked over the
</p>
<p>papers and thereupon made an order as follows:
</p>
<p>' Come now the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy rail-
</p>
<p>road company, and D. E. Richardson by their solici-
</p>
<p>tors, and present their petition to the court, praying for
</p>
<p>an order of the court, requiring the receiver of the
</p>
<p>court appointed herein, and his agents, officers, and
</p>
<p>employes, to perform his duties as a public carrier, as
</p>
<p>respects traffic with such petitioner, and also for an
</p>
<p>order, restraining the association commonly called the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, and its officers,
</p>
<p>and agents, and especially one P. M. Arthur, its chief
</p>
<p>executive officer, as charged in said petition, from, in
</p>
<p>any way, giving any orders to the engineers in the em-
</p>
<p>ploy of the receiver for them to refuse to haul loaded
</p>
<p>cars coming to, or going from, the railroad in charge
</p>
<p>of said receiver in usual business interchange with the
</p>
<p>said petition's corporation, and also praying for an
</p>
<p>order to punish the said Arthur for contempt of court,
</p>
<p>in unlawfully interfering with the administration of the
</p>
<p>property in the custody of the court in this cause.' '
</p>
<p>The case was set for March 9, at 2 p. m.

<p>THE BURLINGTON IN COURT. 313
</p>
<p>This action was in reality an action against the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood, but not being a chartered institution, it
</p>
<p>could not be held accountable only as individuals. The
</p>
<p>action against the Wabash was for the restraining of
</p>
<p>the association, commonly called the Brotherhood of
</p>
<p>Locomotive Engineers, its officers and agents, and
</p>
<p>especially one P. M. Arthur. When the time set for
</p>
<p>trial came, Judge Gresham's court room was crowded
</p>
<p>long before the designated time, by railroad presidents,
</p>
<p>lawyers, engineers, firemen, and others anxious to
</p>
<p>hear what was to be done on this double-barreled
</p>
<p>application of the Burlington to compel the receiver of
</p>
<p>the Wabash to handle Burlington cars, and punish
</p>
<p>Chief Arthur for alleged orders to engineers not to
</p>
<p>handle them. The only way the Burlington could get
</p>
<p>an effective legal fulcrum against the strikers, was to
</p>
<p>get into court on some railroad case. Other managers
</p>
<p>were watching the case closely to see what bearing it
</p>
<p>would have on their interests. The sentiment of a
</p>
<p>large number of those present, including lawyers,
</p>
<p>seemed to be in favor of the strikers. At 2 o'clock
</p>
<p>Judge Gresham entered the court room, followed by
</p>
<p>the attorneys, and after taking his seat said:
</p>
<p>" The motion which was to be argued this afternoon,
</p>
<p>will be postponed until Monday at 2 o'clock p. m."
</p>
<p>The suddenness and brevity of the announcement
</p>
<p>took every one by surprise, and for several moments
</p>
<p>no one realized that the case which had been put off
</p>
<p>was the matter of the great Burlington strike.
</p>
<p>The crowd remained in the hall for an hour or
</p>
<p>more discussing the situation, and it was noticeable

</p>
<p>that the adherents of the Burlington road were few-
</p>
<p>314 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>The complaints were filed under the national inter-
</p>
<p>state commerce law and the United States court could
</p>
<p>hardly fail to sustain it. Judge Gresham, in his decis-
</p>
<p>ion on Monday, said : " Although the property of the
</p>
<p>Wabash company is in the custody of the court, it is
</p>
<p>operated by the receiver as a common carrier. His
</p>
<p>rights and duties are those of a carrier. He is bound
</p>
<p>to afford to all railroad companies whose lines connect
</p>
<p>with his road, equal facilities for the exchangeof traffic.
</p>
<p>It is his duty to receive from, and deliver to other con-
</p>
<p>necting roads both loaded and empty cars. He cannot
</p>
<p>discriminate against one road by maintaining a policy
</p>
<p>of non-intercourse with it. More need not be said on
</p>
<p>this question as the receiver has wisely rescinded the
</p>
<p>instructions which discriminate against the petitioner,
</p>
<p>and he has no purpose or desire to deny the petitioner
</p>
<p>any of his legal rights. Although the petitioner has
</p>
<p>accomplished his chief purpose in invoking the aid of
</p>
<p>the court, it is urged by the counsel that persons
</p>
<p>belonging to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engi-
</p>
<p>neers, and especially one P. M. Arthur, its chief offi-
</p>
<p>cer, have interfered with the receiver, and his subordi-
</p>
<p>nates, in the management of the Wabash property,
</p>
<p>and that they should be punished for their illegal and
</p>
<p>contumacious conduct. The receiver and his counsel
</p>
<p>make no such complaint, on the contrary, the receiver
</p>
<p>declares that there has been no such interference with
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>"For the present it is sufficient to say that the court
</p>
<p>will protect the property of the Wabash company, in
</p>
<p>its custody. The employes of the receiver cannot be

<p>obliged to remain in the service against their will, but
</p>

</p>
<p>neither they, nor others, will be permitted to interfere
</p>
<p>with or disturb the receiver or his subordinates in the
</p>
<p>possession and operation of the property in his custo-
</p>
<p>dy. Lawless interference with the receiver and his
</p>
<p>employes in the discharge of their duty will not be
</p>
<p>tolerated."
</p>
<p>" It is proper to state, however, in justice to the
</p>
<p>Wabash engineers, that they do not desire to maintain
</p>
<p>an attitude of defiance to the law, and that thev are
</p>
<p>willing to aid the receiver in the lawful and successful
</p>
<p>administration of his trust. The receiver's answer
</p>
<p>renders it unnecessary for the court to do more than
</p>
<p>direct that the petition remain on file for future action
</p>
<p>should there be occasion." 1 The Burlington company
</p>
<p>was not well satisfied with the scope of 'this decision.
</p>
<p>They wanted to get some one into jail or into other
</p>
<p>trouble. The Burlington's solicitor, Wirt Dexter, said:
</p>
<p>" Its all right. The Wabash has resumed traffic
</p>
<p>with us. The court has placed the petition on file
</p>
<p>which leaves it open for us to come in again in case of
</p>
<p>any future trouble."
</p>
<p>Alexander Sullivan, for the Brotherhood, said: "Its
</p>
<p>the only decision the court could have rendered. The
</p>
<p>court's declaration against lawless interference or inter-
</p>
<p>vention is in harmony with the doctrines of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood, and will meet with their approval.
</p>
<p>There had been no such interference and there would
</p>
<p>be none by the Brotherhood. The court .properly
</p>
<p>lays down the doctrine that no man can be compelled
</p>
<p>to work for less wages than he is willing to accept. It
</p>
<p>is on a line with the Illinois statute, and, what is greater,
</p>
<p>the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery." '

<p>3l6 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>This line of action was followed up closely by the
</p>
<p>Burlington, and, in a similar case against the Belt
</p>
<p>Line, of Chicago, it made the charges more specific
</p>
<p>against the enginemen, charging "that the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood of Locomotive Engineers, or their officers, have
</p>
<p>secretly resolved to carry out a boycott against com-
</p>
<p>plainant for the illegal purpose of injuring the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington's business. It charges them with unlawful
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and asks for an injunction against the un-
</p>
<p>known members of the Brotherhood whose names are
</p>
<p>to be inserted when discovered."
</p>
<p>The Burlington was feeling somewhat elated over
</p>
<p>this new move which they expected would do so
</p>
<p>much for them. Many of the officials of other roads
</p>
<p>thought that if a decision was rendered by Judge
</p>
<p>Gresham, favoring the Burlington, the engineers
</p>
<p>would not dare ignore its condition on any other road
</p>
<p>'and that the strike would be ended in a week. But
</p>
<p>it will be seen that these officers, as well as those of
</p>
<p>the Burlington, were greatly mistaken. General
</p>
<p>Manager Stone was made to realize that coercion
</p>
<p>would not work with all men, and that some of the
</p>
<p>others managers thought they had interests that
</p>
<p>should not be subordinated to the Burlington.
</p>
<p>The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific, having
</p>
<p>refused to take Burlington traffic, Mr. Stone, in order
</p>
<p>to get a basis for legal proceedings against that road

</p>
<p>Dear Sir-
</p>
<p>I enclose copy of telegram which has been re-
</p>
<p>ceived here from Rock Island, saving that both the
</p>
<p>Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific, and the Peoria and
</p>
<p>Rock Island roads decline to do business with us. I
</p>
<p>cannot suppose that this is by any authority from

<p>headquarters, and I write to ask you to tell me the
</p>
<p>facts, and the reasons if there are any, for the alleged
</p>
<p>refusal. If the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy has
</p>
<p>done anything to justify such an attitude of non-inter-
</p>
<p>course, I shall be glad to know what it is. 1
</p>
<p>Yours Truly,
</p>
<p>H. B. Stone."
</p>
<p>The answer to this from Mr. St. John, must have
</p>
<p>made Mr. Stone feel in some doubt about the sweep-
</p>
<p>ing success anticipated in their appeal to the court 
</p>
<p>to save us if you kill all the rest. Mr. St. John had, on
</p>
<p>the 6th inst., made answer to a like communication in
</p>
<p>the following:
</p>
<p>Chicago, March 6, 1888.

<p>H. B. Stone, General Manager, Chicago, Burlington

</p>
<p>Dear Sir:
</p>
<p>" I have your favor of March 6, and must state in
</p>
<p>reply, that I am surprised that your company in the
</p>
<p>present condition of things, should insist or even sug-
</p>
<p>gest, that the Rock Island, or any of its adjuncts,
</p>
<p>should receive freight from, or deliver freight to your
</p>
<p>company until a better condition of things exists. To
</p>
<p>do so would jeopardize our entire interest, and

<p>this at this moment we are not willing to do. Our

</p>
<p>position is not different from that occupied by other
</p>
<p>Chicago lines, and you should have, I think, no feeling
</p>
<p>concerning such action on your part, which is only one
</p>
<p>of self protection. You may be assured that the
</p>
<p>Rock Island is always glad to aid the Chicago, Bur-
</p>
<p>lington & Quincy when it can do so without getting
</p>
<p>itself into serious trouble. Our past action is proof of
</p>
<p>this as you well know. We believe it to be equally
</p>
<p>in your interest as well as ours, that the position
</p>
<p>we and others assume, should, for the present at
</p>
<p>least, be maintained.*'
</p>
<p>Respectfully.
</p>
<p>E. St. John, General Manager.
</p>
<p>On receipt of Mr. Stone's second letter of the 8th,
</p>
<p>Mr. St. John, in his answer savs: " That there may be
</p>
<p>no misunderstanding as to the position of the Chicago,
</p>
<p>Rock Island & Pacific company in regard to exchange
</p>
<p>of traffic with the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
</p>
<p>railroad company, I desire to- add to my hastily
</p>
<p>written note of the 6th inst.. the following:
</p>
<p>" This company is willing to perform all duties im-
</p>
<p>posed upon it by law as common carriers, and will do
</p>
<p>so when able. It will not refuse to perform such
</p>
<p>ies to all because it is rendered, by circumstances
</p>
<p>for which it is not responsible, unable to perform them
</p>
<p>as to one. It will not suspend the operation as to its
</p>
<p>entire line, and inflict incalculable injury upon the com-
</p>
<p>munities dependent upon itfor transportation, because
</p>
<p>circumstances render it impossible for it to exchange
</p>
<p>traffic with another railroad company. The engineers

<p>from, or delivered to your road. We have done
</p>
<p>THE BURLINGTON IN COURT. 319
</p>
<p>nothing to induce this resolution. To discharge them
</p>
<p>would not enable us to exchange with you, while it
</p>
<p>would render it impossible to carry for anybody
</p>
<p>else."'
</p>
<p>"We occupy no attitude of non-intercourse, but do
</p>
<p>refuse to injure all of our patrons because we cannot
</p>
<p>help you. I cannot see how bringing about a general
</p>
<p>suspension of the operations of railways in the west,
</p>
<p>can aid you in your present struggle, while I can see
</p>
<p>that it would work great injury to the country. We
</p>
<p>are not willing to attempt the impossible, with the
</p>
<p>knowledge that the attempt will injure many and bene-
</p>
<p>fit none." 1 Respectfully Yours,
</p>
<p>E. St. John.
</p>
<p>For once, Mr. Morton, the Burlington's news dis-
</p>
<p>penser, was obliged to hold himself in. Upon being
</p>
<p>respectfully touched by the pencil of a reporter,
</p>
<p>"Comment upon such a document is unnecessary," said
</p>
<p>Mr. Morton, " and it is hardly right for me to express
</p>
<p>an opinion upon the sentiments contained in that let-
</p>
<p>ter. I will say that under no circumstances would
</p>
<p>such a letter have emanated from this office." But
</p>
<p>their harrowed feelings found great solace in the re-
</p>
<p>straining order of one Judge Dundy, of Nebraska, on
</p>
<p>March 9.
</p>
<p>The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroad by
</p>
<p>its solicitors, C. G. Green and T. M. Marquette, coun-

<p>ion Pacific lines, also restraining the engineers of the
</p>
<p>Union Pacific from striking, or confederating to or-
</p>
<p>ganize a strike, to force the Burlington to accede to
</p>
<p>the demands of the strikers, and from discharging the
</p>
<p>men now employed. In Judge Dundy they found a
</p>
<p>man who came very near doing what they wanted
</p>
<p>him to do. We extract from Judge Dundy's restrain-
</p>
<p>ing order the following passages:
</p>
<p>"That you each and everyone of you, do absolutely
</p>
<p>desist and refrain from striking, combining, or confed-
</p>
<p>erating, for the purpose of organizing or assisting a
</p>
<p>strike, and from doing any other act or thing, and
</p>
<p>from refusing to perform any other act or thing in
</p>
<p>carrying out your unlawful, unjust and wicked purpose,
</p>
<p>through your unlawful, unjust and wicked combina-
</p>
<p>tion, connivance, and conspiracy, either as individuals
</p>
<p>or as members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
</p>
<p>Engineers."' '
</p>
<p>The Burlington officials mixed this morsel of good
</p>
<p>cheer with their utter contempt for managers who had
</p>
<p>refused to jeopardize their own interest to help the
</p>
<p>Burlington. Yet regardless of this order, "the Union
</p>
<p>Pacific; x\tchison, Topeka & Santa Fe; Denver &
</p>
<p>Rio Crande and Midland railroads were not handling
</p>
<p>Burlington business, and it was intimated that they did
</p>
<p>not intend to." l The strikers and the Union Pacific
</p>
<p>enginemen were somewhat concerned about this order,
</p>
<p>but the Union Pacific men said the court could not
</p>
<p>force them to touch the Burlington cars, and if it was
</p>
<p>demanded they would quit.

<p>The Union Pacific men employed General Cowin

<p>THE BURLINGTON" IN COURT. 32 1
</p>
<p>clients, the engineers, General Cowin contended
</p>
<p>" that the bill was tiled against them bv the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton and Missouri railroad, as a part and parcel of a
</p>
<p>plan to compel them to work in direct opposition to
</p>
<p>their wishes for the purpose of aiding them, the com-
</p>
<p>plainants, in their fight with the Brotherhood of Loco-
</p>
<p>motive Engineers. As a naked proposition of law,
</p>
<p>he submitted as a question of common sense, that
</p>
<p>there is no law to compel men to work when they
</p>
<p>desire to quit, and that alone seems to be the object
</p>
<p>of the bill."
</p>
<p>Then said the court, " If that be the sole object, this
</p>
<p>case has no business here. I shall never order a man
</p>
<p>to work against his will by injunction."
</p>
<p>During General Cowin's argument, the word strike
</p>
<p>was used several times as it had been in the bill, which
</p>
<p>provoked the following comment from the court:
</p>
<p>"This word strike is of modern origin; the question is
</p>
<p>regarding its legal definition and on that this case may
</p>
<p>turn. If it means, and it can be shown that its mean-
</p>
<p>ing in this case is, a project to kick up the devil gen-
</p>
<p>erally, derail cars and ditch trains, then this court can
</p>
<p>order a writ of injunction to restrain the injury con-
</p>
<p>templated as a measure of contemplative justice, and
</p>
<p>the charge of conspiracy is well taken. If, on the
</p>
<p>other hand, the word in this case is synonvmous with
</p>
<p>an intention of quitting work, and quietly walking out,
</p>
<p>I don't see how this court is going to restrain this
</p>
<p>action." l
</p>
<p>J. M. Thurston, for the Union Pacific road, averred
</p>
<p>in part, " that the greatest rivalry had always existed
</p>
<p>between the two roads. Much of their revenue was

<p>derived from the same sources, and the Burlington
</p>
<p>road had never lost an opportunity in competition, to
</p>
<p>further its interest at the expense of the Union Pacific;
</p>
<p>that the Union Pacific recognized its obligations under
</p>
<p>the law, and had ordered its men to handle the traffic
</p>
<p>of the Burlington, and when the men refused such
</p>
<p>orders, they were taken suddenly ill with an epidemic
</p>
<p>which, for want of a better name, was known as the
</p>
<p>" Q colic, " and refused to obey the orders. If the
</p>
<p>company persist in the demand under the law and the
</p>
<p>men quit the great corporation, the Union Pacific
</p>
<p>would have to cease operations because of its inability
</p>
<p>to supply their places." 2 The Burlington contended,
</p>
<p>" that where the common action of a bod}- of men
</p>
<p>tended to produce the same result by the same com-
</p>
<p>mon means, controlled by the same power, and the
</p>
<p>object was to damage and injure any single individual,
</p>
<p>or corporation, it was the duty of the court to restrain
</p>
<p>such action." '
</p>
<p>judge Dundy gave as his decision that " the engi-
</p>
<p>neers on the Union Pacific have the right to quit work
</p>
<p>when they please, but they have not the right to enter
</p>
<p>into a conspiracy, and by concerted action suddenly
</p>
<p>leave the Union Pacific road without engineers,
</p>
<p>when the purpose of the conspiracy is to prevent the
</p>
<p>Union Pacific road from exchanging freight with the
</p>
<p>Burlington as by inter-state commerce law it is re-
</p>
<p>quired to do. Against such action the court will en-
</p>
<p>join. Neither have the engineers the right to refuse
</p>
<p>to pull Burlington cars, and such refusal would subject
</p>
<p>them to imprisonment. The Union Pacific is the
</p>
<p>creation of congress. It bears the national birth

</p>
<p>To add to all these combinations and difficulties that

<p>in addition to a great multitude from all parts of the

<p>ized themselves into an advisory board, something not

<p>not desired by the grand officers. However it is
</p>
<p>reasonable to suppose they were actuated by the best

<p>of motives, yet with mature deliberation these men
</p>
<p>must have seen that an advisory board, whether legal-
</p>
<p>ly constituted or not, must have some influence, pre-
</p>
<p>sumed or real, with other men, and unless they were
</p>
<p>guided in their every act by the grand officers, whom

<p>they worked. 1
</p>
<p>From the best information obtainable this board
</p>
<p>held meetings and adopted plans for their own guid-
</p>
<p>ance, exercised an influence over the grand officers,
</p>
<p>meeting with them and doing divers things. They
</p>
<p>were not, like the staff of a general, responsible to
</p>
<p>him, and subject to his final decision, but as individ-
</p>
<p>uals, representing fractional interests, in the interest of
</p>
<p>one road instead of the whole. In forming this body
</p>
<p>these men laid themselves liable to grave suspicion of
</p>
<p>looking after their own interest, instead of the com-
</p>
<p>mon good. However good their intentions might
</p>
<p>ha\ e been, it is certain the influence exercised by
</p>
<p>them as a whole, was harmful.
</p>
<p>No man can serve faithfully one interest, and be paid
</p>
<p>by another. He may honestly think his interest and
</p>
<p>the common interest of the engineers and firemen are
</p>
<p>identical with the company whom they serve. This
</p>
<p>is the right principal in peace, but not in war, and
</p>
<p>much of the lack of harmony among all, emanated
</p>
<p>from a lack of harmony of opinion among the advisory
</p>
<p>board, as they termed it. Many things were laid at
</p>
<p>their door, perhaps unjustly, yet their assumed position
</p>
<p>made them a target for charges made later, of a grave
</p>
<p>nature.
</p>
<p>The Burlington management issued the following
</p>
<p>bulletin order to conductors: " As we are going to
</p>
<p>open up our business, and will discontinue the running
</p>
<p>of pilots, we will expect you or one of your brakemen
</p>
<p>to show the new engineer the road when necessary."
</p>
<p>This obliged the brakemen to pilot and assist the new
</p>
<p>men. The grand officers of the strikers, having been

</p>
<p>assured of Mr. Wilkinson's good will, that gentleman
</p>
<p>was invited to headquarters, to which he immediately
</p>
<p>responded, and after consultation he was requested to
</p>
<p>go over the road and instruct all concerned that no
</p>
<p>member of the brakemen's order would be allowed to
</p>
<p>do anything but his legitimate business and to do no
</p>
<p>piloting. He visited all the terminal points on the
</p>
<p>Burlington system, and did all he could to prevent any
</p>
<p>special services being rendered to the company out-
</p>
<p>side of their regular duties. The Burlington had
</p>
<p>manned every engine with a pilot to keep their new
</p>
<p>men out of trouble, but it was expensive, and they
</p>
<p>thought to do away with it by having the conductor or
</p>
<p>brakeman ride on the engine and still keep them out
</p>
<p>of trouble. The Burlington officials evidently expect-
</p>
<p>ed much from the conductors in piloting, and compet-
</p>
<p>ing the brakemen to do the same. They no doubt,
</p>
<p>based their assurance upon an understanding with
</p>
<p>Messrs. Belknap and Cross, employes of the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton, who issued a circular March 10, which was
</p>
<p>sanctioned by the chief officer of that order, Grand
</p>
<p>Chief Conductor, C. S. Wheaton. An extract from
</p>
<p>the circular reads as folio ws :
</p>
<p>"The railroad officials commenced Sunday afternoon,
</p>
<p>February 26, to clean up the line, and Sunday night
</p>
<p>saw all freights abandoned as fast as engineers and
</p>
<p>firemen refused to go out. Loyal employes stepped
</p>
<p>on their engines, and the result was that passenger
</p>
<p>trains continued to run from that day to this. Con-
</p>
<p>ductors and brakemen, with scarcely an exception along
</p>
<p>the whole line, tendered their services in any capacity

</p>
<p>where they could be most useful. They ran engines,
</p>
<p>326 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>fired engines, acted as pilots, and performed police
</p>
<p>dnty. All, whether members of an}- society or not,
</p>
<p>seemed to vie with each other in showing their loyalty
</p>
<p>in this time of trouble, and tendering their services in
</p>
<p>any capacity where needed. This full expression of
</p>
<p>loyalty on the part of the trainmen was far bevond the
</p>
<p>most sanguine expectation of any of our officers.
</p>
<p>While they counted on some remaining firm, they were
</p>
<p>not prepared to see the loyalty so universal, and as
</p>
<p>train after train was taken from its starting to destina-
</p>
<p>tion in safety and nearly on time, by faithful men, they
</p>
<p>could not find words to express their approval of our
</p>
<p>acts, and we are satisfied that they will express their
</p>
<p>feelings in a very substantial way when the proper
</p>
<p>time comes." There is much more to this circular,
</p>
<p>but this extract embodies the essence of it. This
</p>
<p>brought a reply from the Brakemen's Journal, which
</p>
<p>places the circular in its right light:
</p>
<p>"The above statement is a lie out of a whole cloth,
</p>
<p>so far as it pertains to the brakemen, and no one
</p>
<p>knows it better than Messrs. Belknap, Cross and
</p>
<p>Wheaton. The brakemen preserved a strict neutrali-
</p>
<p>ty, and took no part in this strike. They performed
</p>
<p>their usual duties promptly and faithfully, but did not
</p>
<p>take the place of the strikers, as stated in the circular.
</p>
<p>"The action of the brakemen on the Burlington is
</p>
<p>endorsed by our Brotherhood everywhere, by the Lo-
</p>
<p>comotive Brotherhoods, and by the Burlington offic-
</p>
<p>ials. They adopted a manly course and behaved like
</p>
<p>men, and not like the fawning sycophants who, lost to
</p>
<p>all sense of manhood and honor, tried to currv favor

</p>
<p>them giving up good positions on other roads thous-
</p>
<p>ands of miles away, to come and defeat the engineers
</p>
<p>and firemen on the Burlington."
</p>
<p>The pilots were mostly conductors who knew the
</p>
<p>road, and smash-ups had been few owing to this pre-
</p>
<p>caution. But the engines had suffered. Many of
</p>
<p>their engines had been very badly burned, although
</p>
<p>the officials denied thai such was the fact. I am per-
</p>
<p>sonally knowing to a case where the flue sheet was
</p>
<p>pulled away from the crown sheet until your hand
</p>
<p>would go into the space. It was stated on good
</p>
<p>authority, that a large number suffered from this
</p>
<p>cause: but the Burlington seemed to care nothing for
</p>
<p>cost. They were not, however, opening up their
</p>
<p>interchange of business, as they had hoped would be
</p>
<p>the case. From the legal proceedings, nearly all the
</p>
<p>lines held their doors closed against the Burlington.
</p>
<p>Meetings were being held in Kansas City, attended
</p>
<p>by men from all roads centering there, watching the
</p>
<p>situation. At East St. Louis, March n, Division 49
</p>
<p>held a meeting attended by some 200, and it was de-
</p>
<p>cided not to handle Burlington cars. The Missouri
</p>
<p>and Pacific men had the "colic" at the sight of a Bur-
</p>
<p>lington car as bad as did the men of the Union Pacific.
</p>
<p>In fact, at any time from March 1 to March 15, from
</p>
<p>all indications of the temper of the enginemen through-
</p>
<p>out the country, almost every western roa& could
</p>
<p>have been stopped at the word of command. Had the
</p>
<p>leaders of the brotherhoods adopted the same course
</p>
<p>as that chosen by the Burlington, i. e., " rule or ruin,"
</p>
<p>and had similarly violated their own laws, and been

</p>
<p>equally indifferent to public weal or woe, there would
</p>
<p>328 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>have been one of the greatest strikes in the annals
</p>
<p>of history. The strike on the Burlington system, as
</p>
<p>it was conducted, would have been but a drop in the
</p>
<p>wave of business disaster.
</p>
<p>But instead of crowding the issue, destroying prop-
</p>
<p>ertv, and violating their own laws, as it was so freely
</p>
<p>charged they would do, they followed a conservative
</p>
<p>policy that prevented general disaster, preserved
</p>
<p>their self respect and forestalled defeat. When the
</p>
<p>grievance men came to Chicago and passed resolu-
</p>
<p>tions to boycott, in order to carry out the conditions,
</p>
<p>they must go home to their respective roads, call
</p>
<p>their committee together, vote to sustain or not sus-
</p>
<p>tain its conditions; if sustained by the home vote, they
</p>
<p>must wait on the home officers, and ask them to com-
</p>
<p>ply with the boycott and so prevent trouble. This
</p>
<p>considerate method was carried out in every case.
</p>
<p>If the strikers had been indifferent to the public
</p>
<p>good, and had used such means as were at their com-
</p>
<p>mand on March 6, it is reasonable to say that they
</p>
<p>could have stopped every connecting line west and
</p>
<p>south of the Burlington, and a majority of those run-
</p>
<p>ning east. But they commenced the strike b}*' leaving
</p>
<p>the Burlington engines at terminal points, in good or
</p>
<p>der:they persuaded, hired, and bought awa}- the new
</p>
<p>men. It had failed to keep the Burlington from fi-
</p>
<p>nally, in some manner, manning their engines. The
</p>
<p>next best means, and the least injurious to the public,
</p>
<p>was the boycott. The power of the boycott was
</p>
<p>killed, so far as compelling a settlement was con-
</p>
<p>cerned, by conservatism in the use of that power.

<p>The resort to a boycott can be successful onlv when
</p>
<p>THE BURLINGTON IN COURT. 329
</p>
<p>it is entered upon with unanimity, and pursued vigor-
</p>
<p>ously and regardless of consequences. There was
</p>
<p>evidently a lack of harmony in the opinion of the men
</p>
<p>as to the necessities of the situation. Thomas Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son said : " Every difference of opinion is not a differ-
</p>
<p>ence of principle." They were united in defending
</p>
<p>their principles, but differed as to the means. One
</p>
<p>policy should have been adopted and adhered to with
</p>
<p>the firmness of the signers of the declaration of inde-
</p>
<p>pendence. Said one of the members, " We must all
</p>
<p>hang together in this business." " Yes," said Benjamin
</p>
<p>Franklin, " we must all hang together or most assured-
</p>
<p>ly we will all hang singly."
</p>
<p>The decision of Judge Gresham on March 12 had
</p>
<p>opened the Wabash to the Burlington. The judge
</p>
<p>said: " The Wabash engineers do not desire to main-
</p>
<p>tain an attitude of defiance to the law, that they
</p>
<p>are willing to aid the receiver in the lawful and sue-
</p>
<p>cessful administration of his trust." In war, a break
</p>
<p>in the line could be closed up, but in this case it must
</p>
<p>stand so long as the men themselves would not form
</p>
<p>the line. This had two results: first, a tendency to
</p>
<p>weaken others, who by this time had time to weigh in
</p>
<p>the balance their own interests with the common
</p>
<p>interest, and with man}-, self-interest is found to out-
</p>
<p>weigh the other, and such as these held up the deci-
</p>
<p>sion of Judge Gresham, and withdrew active support.
</p>
<p>Second, the vivid impression of the conspiracy law
</p>
<p>and the specified effort to find some means by which
</p>
<p>the grand officers could be held accountable under
</p>
<p>legal process, caused them to transfer the active con-

<p>trol of the strike to the local committees, the direct
</p>
<p>33 T1IE BURLINGTON" STRIKE.
</p>
<p>result of which was the strike of the Atchison, Tope-
</p>
<p>ka & Santa Fe, on March 15.
</p>
<p>A committee of engineers and firemen of the Atchi-
</p>
<p>son, Topeka & Santa Fe had waited on the managers
</p>
<p>of that road on March 8 and 9. The object was to
</p>
<p>solicit them not to handle Burlington freight, assur-
</p>
<p>ing them that the best of feeling existed between the
</p>
<p>company and the employes, but that they wished
</p>
<p>to assist their friends, the strikers on the Burlington,
</p>
<p>and that they should refuse to handle Burlington bus-
</p>
<p>iness after Sunday morning, March 11. It was not
</p>
<p>their intention to strike, but each man would act for
</p>
<p>himself. "The officers assured the grievance commit-
</p>
<p>tee that they could not expect that the company would
</p>
<p>act in violation of the laws of the United States, that
</p>
<p>they would lay their notice before the board of direct-
</p>
<p>ors for their consideration, pending which it was pre-
</p>
<p>sumed that no action would be taken by the engi-
</p>
<p>neers. The officers of the road said further that from
</p>
<p>that time on, in no instance was any engineer,
</p>
<p>against his wishes, asked to handle anv train contain-
</p>
<p>ing Chicago, Burlington & Quincy cars." ' While the
</p>
<p>engineers and firemen, on the contrary, claimed they
</p>
<p>were trying to aid the Burlington.
</p>
<p>There seemed to be a combination of circumstances
</p>
<p>at Kansas City that caused feeling to run high, and
</p>
<p>the moderation so prevalent elsewhere was wanting at
</p>
<p>this point. The Burlington owns the ground and yard
</p>
<p>surrounding the Union depot, where the trains of near-
</p>
<p>ly all the roads centering at Kansas City come in and
</p>
<p>go out of one depot. This brought together men

<p>from the Union Pacific: Missouri Pacific: Atchison,

</p>
<p>Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific, and man)- other lines
</p>
<p>of less importance, to meet with the strikers.
</p>
<p>The direct connection of freight traffic of all tin :se
</p>
<p>roads with the Burlington yard kept the men busy
</p>
<p>watching all the^ outlets. Every encroachment upon
</p>
<p>the boycott was magnified by one after another of the
</p>
<p>men congregated there, who were not committee men,
</p>
<p>and consequently not held responsible for the influence
</p>
<p>they exercised. It was unavoidable that the mature
</p>
<p>deliberation, so necessary to unity of action, became
</p>
<p>impossible; besides, the Fort Scott & Gulf and the
</p>
<p>Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe were both Boston
</p>
<p>interests, and holders of stock in these roads were
</p>
<p>stockholders in the Burlington, which created an an-
</p>
<p>tipathy against them, the men believing  from the
</p>
<p>known pecuniary interest of these roads  that they
</p>
<p>were making special effort to help out the Burlington.
</p>
<p>The Union Pacific is another Boston interest, but a
</p>
<p>Burlington car made thirty engineers suddenly sick on
</p>
<p>the morning of the fourteenth at Omaha. At Council
</p>
<p>Bluffs the " colic ; " was raging, because there were
</p>
<p>Burlington cars in the trains as made up. Judge
</p>
<p>Dundy's restraining order had no terror for them.
</p>
<p>The heat of the battle seemed for the time to be trans-
</p>
<p>ferred from Chicago to the south and west.
</p>
<p>An Associated Press reporter went over the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington line from Chicago to Kansas City, visiting
</p>
<p>Aurora, Mendota, Galesburg, Burlington, Chariton,

</p>
<p>visited by him, but at each point the railroad officials
</p>
<p>were seen. As nearly as one could judge from the
</p>
<p>evidence of both sides, "the Burlington system was do-
</p>
<p>ing from 40 to 50 per cent of the business which it did
</p>
<p>before the strike. At every point mentioned passen-
</p>
<p>ger trains were from one to six hours-late. In regard
</p>
<p>to the freight business each division superintendent
</p>
<p>that was seen frankly stated that the road was doing
</p>
<p>much less business than before the strike. They said
</p>
<p>that there were no cattle carried over the road, except
</p>
<p>where the company had bought the cattle in the pens.
</p>
<p>Freight trains, where they were formerly made up of
</p>
<p>about thirty cars, were then composed of from nine to
</p>
<p>twenty. In some instances engines drawing way cars
</p>
<p>were sent out and counted as trains. While they did
</p>
<p>not express themselves in sympathy with the strikers,
</p>
<p>they did say they wished that the old hands were back
</p>
<p>at the throttle. " !
</p>
<p>The brotherhood men were making strenuous efforts
</p>
<p>to decrease even this small showing. The progress
</p>
<p>of the Burlington, added to the court proceedings, made
</p>
<p>many fear for the future of the brotherhoods, if the
</p>
<p>battle wa's lost. The railroad officials no doubt hoped,
</p>
<p>and the brotherhoods feared, that failure would be a
</p>
<p>Waterloo to these institutions, that a retrograde move-
</p>
<p>ment would be demanded by other companies. This
</p>
<p>feelino- created a radical sentiment, especially among
</p>
<p>the western men.
</p>
<p>It was charged that freight was being transferred
</p>
<p>at Kansas City, from Burlington cars into Atchison,
</p>
<p>Topeka & Santa Fe cars, by teams drawing it some-
</p>
<p>distance. This was taken for bad faith on the Dart of

</p>
<p>Kansas City, Mo., March 15, 1888.
</p>
<p>"J. F. Goddard, general manager, Atchison, Tope-
</p>
<p>ka & Santa Fe.
</p>
<p>Topeka, Kansas,:
</p>
<p> Engineers and firemen of the Santa Fe system
</p>
<p>will quit at 4 o'clock p. m.
</p>
<p>J. Conroe, Chairman." '
</p>
<p>On receipt of this, Manager Goddard sent the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing:
</p>
<p>J. Conroe, chairman grievance committee, Atchi-
</p>
<p>son, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway.
</p>
<p>Kansas City:
</p>
<p>At 3 : 50 this afternoon I received your telegram,
</p>
<p>notifying me that the engineers and firemen whom you
</p>
<p>represent would quit at 4 o'clock to-day. As we have
</p>
<p>faithfully kept every written and verbal agreement
</p>
<p>made with }-our organization, your action is a surprise,
</p>
<p>and I would be glad to know on what it is taken.
</p>
<p>Also, do you intend that it shall cover passenger train
</p>
<p>service as well as freight? '
</p>
<p>Mr. Conroe sent to Grand Chief Arthur a telegram
</p>
<p>stating, " Engineers and firemen are satisfied that the
</p>
<p>Santa Fe did not remain neutral, and sav they were
</p>
<p>justified in this move." Answer
</p>
<p>J. Conroe.
</p>
<p>No one expected this move, and the strike of the
</p>
<p>engineers and firemen on the Atchison, Topeka &
</p>
<p>Santa Fe road was the exciting topic at the strikers'
</p>
<p>headquarters. From all the reports received it was

</p>
<p>engineers and a corresponding number of firemen.
</p>
<p>The Santa Fe men appeared to be determined to stand
</p>
<p>out, although no specific cause of grievance could be
</p>
<p>discovered. Chief Arthur was completely taken by-
</p>
<p>surprise at the announcement of the strike, and sent a
</p>
<p>telegram to the chairman, Mr. Conroe, to come to
</p>
<p>Chicago immediately.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur was inclined to think that some subor-
</p>
<p>dinate officer had attempted to compel the men to
</p>
<p>handle Burlington freight and had thus precipitated a
</p>
<p>strike which he had -been most anxious to avoid. And
</p>
<p>he said that if the men have struck without cause they
</p>
<p>have done wrong.
</p>
<p>Interviews with a number of the striking engineers
</p>
<p>of the Santa Fe road, developed the fact that they had
</p>
<p>examined the list of stockholders on the Chicago, Bur-
</p>
<p>lington & Quincy, and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa
</p>
<p>Fe, and found that a considerable number of the Santa
</p>
<p>Fe stockholders are also largely interested in the
</p>
<p>. Burlington. The Fort Scott & Gulf stockholders
</p>
<p>were also interested in the Burlington. The engine-
</p>
<p>men had no grievance with the Santa Fe, but they
</p>
<p>would rest until the Burlington road should come to
</p>
<p>terms with its employes.
</p>
<p>Much having been said by the press about the men
</p>
<p>giving the Santa Fe only thirty minutes notice,
</p>
<p>one of the old engineers said: " Now, that's all wrong.
</p>
<p>Our committee had been urging the company every
</p>
<p>day, since we found that they were smuggling Bur-
</p>
<p>lington freight into the cars, to stop it. The com-
</p>
<p>mittee called on Mr. Goddard no less than three times

</p>
<p>and told him the company was handling Burlington
</p>
<p>THE BURLINGTON IN COURT. 335
</p>
<p>freight and that the men would not stand it. He gave
</p>
<p>us no satisfaction. The Santa Fe has not acted fairly
</p>
<p>with us." '
</p>
<p>The extent of the Santa Fe road and its branches is
</p>
<p>nearly 7000 miles, on which were employed seven
</p>
<p>hundred engineers and a like number of firemen, and
</p>
<p>2.800 trainmen. It is said there was standing along
</p>
<p>the line 1,200 cars of merchandise. Many officials
</p>
<p>who had been watching this great sympathy strike at
</p>
<p>Chicago, were transferred to Kansas City, with noth-
</p>
<p>ing to do but watch developments. The grievance
</p>
<p>committeemen from all the roads were there, and
</p>
<p>everything had the appearance of a general strike of
</p>
<p>all southwestern roads. The men of the Fort Scott
</p>
<p>and Gulf had contemplated going out on the same
</p>
<p>day. or soon after the Santa Fe, but the men on that
</p>
<p>line were apparently not a unit. Without the sanc-
</p>
<p>tion of their grand officers, the chairman of that sys-
</p>
<p>tem had gone to Chicago to see the grand chief and
</p>
<p>enter his complaints, and this prevented any extension
</p>
<p>of the strike.
</p>
<p>Although the Santa Fe strike was ill advised, it
</p>
<p>was one of the most astonishing exhibitions of good
</p>
<p>will towards their fellow men that the world has ever
</p>
<p>seen, when we remember that they take no obligation
</p>
<p>that compels obedience to command, and that a strike
</p>
<p>of this kind could not be inaugurated only by the indiv-
</p>
<p>idual consent of each one, and in this case they were
</p>
<p>spread out over 7,000 miles of territory, and as one
</p>
<p>met the other and told the news, their places were in-
</p>
<p>stantly vacated, all alike, actuated by the same senti-
</p>
<p>ment. It is our brother in trouble; let us do whatever

<p>we can to help him out of it. What a picture of un-
</p>
<p>selfish devotion! and what a comparison between these
</p>
<p>men who forgot self in their anxiety for their brothers,
</p>
<p>and that mass of selfishness, incompetency and drunk-
</p>
<p>enness, that had with in the last two weeks been poured
</p>
<p>into the vacancies of the Burlington.
</p>
<p>" On the morning of the 16th of March, at Kansas
</p>
<p>City, not a wheel was turning except a few switch
</p>
<p>engines. The engineers and firemen persisted in sav-
</p>
<p>ing they had received no orders to strike; they were
</p>
<p>simply tired and wanted rest. The Union depot pre-
</p>
<p>sented a regular castle garden appearance, as though
</p>
<p>hundreds of emigrants had been brought in whose
</p>
<p>destination was somewhere on the Santa Fe. Two
</p>
<p>hundred of them were crowded into the emigrant
</p>
<p>room, and there were new accessions hourly." !
</p>
<p>At 11 :20 a. m., the foreman of the Santa Fe round-
</p>
<p>house, at Argentine, backed an engine up to the Union
</p>
<p>depot and coupled on to train No. 3, which was the
</p>
<p>through California express. Ben Horton, who had
</p>
<p>been an engineer on the Santa Fe road for ten years,
</p>
<p>mounted the engine. He was not a Brotherhood man,
</p>
<p>having been expelled from that organization during the
</p>
<p>strike of i877- He afterwards applied for re-admis-
</p>
<p>sion, but was rejected.
</p>
<p>"A sensation was created in the crowd that surround-
</p>
<p>ed the engine, by the appearance of Horton's wife,
</p>
<p>who pushed her way through and was assisted to a
</p>
<p>seat by her husband, when she declared her intention
</p>
<p>of acting as fireman on the trip. She covered her
</p>
<p>clothing with a rubber ulster while a fireman's cap set
</p>
<p>jauntily on her black hair." 2 Before starting, the

<p>enginemen made an effort to induce Horton not to go,
</p>
<p>offering him money, but the wife, the would-be fire-
</p>
<p>man, is said to have been armed with a revolver, and
</p>
<p>compelled, her liege lord to stay at his post. This
</p>
<p>woman who went out as fireman was formerly Hattie
</p>
<p>Reed, of Kewanee, 111. During the strike of 1877 s ^ ie
</p>
<p>acted as fireman for her husband from Galesbursr to
</p>
<p>Burlington. The news gatherers gave her consider-
</p>
<p>able notoriety, but the reader will probably make his
</p>
<p>own estimate ot this exception to the timiditv of the
</p>
<p>gentler sex.
</p>
<p>Callers were kept busy hunting the city over for
</p>
<p>engineers and firemen, but they kept out of the way.
</p>
<p>The Kansas City Journal said:
</p>
<p>" Two weeks ago a traveling printer was dropped
</p>
<p>from the "fournal sub-list. To-night he showed up
</p>
<p>at the office with two revolvers strapped on his person,
</p>
<p>and with an engineer's book, etc., showing him to
</p>
<p>be a full fledged Burlington engineer. His experience
</p>
<p>is two years in a machine shop. He was loaned to the
</p>
<p>Santa Fe and goes out to-night for one week's work.
</p>
<p>He has had two accidents.'' , This young man is one
</p>
<p>of those ' competent men ' of whom Officer A. C.
</p>
<p>Dawes, of the Kansas City, St, Joseph & Council
</p>
<p>Bluffs road said: " In no instance has there been a
</p>
<p>high grade engineer displaced to make room for a low
</p>
<p>grade," yet this man or boy, was pulling passenger
</p>
<p>trains on that road when Mr. Dawes gave this inform-
</p>
<p>ation to the public. " The Santa Fe did not seem
</p>
<p>anxious to make use of such material, and preferred

<p>' The general superintendent received many applica-
</p>
<p>tions for situations as engineers, but no new men were
</p>
<p>engaged.' " ]
</p>
<p>The situation was hourly becoming more complica-
</p>
<p>ted; the lack of concerted action was apparent.
</p>
<p>Leaders were wanting who could command a view of
</p>
<p>the whole situation, with power to guide, and formu-
</p>
<p>late plans for the action of this great army of engine-
</p>
<p>men. The}- were like a ship at sea without a rudder.
</p>
<p>The laws of the Brotherhoods had not been made
</p>
<p>with powers centered in the leaders. They could
</p>
<p>only advise and consent, and with the grand officers
</p>
<p>located within the scope of the Illinois conspiracy law,
</p>
<p>that advice must be of a peaceful nature. The Santa Fe
</p>
<p>was out. The Fort Scott & Gulf was on the balance,
</p>
<p>and were to have -followed the Santa Fe at four
</p>
<p>o'clock the same dav, but the chairmen of the griev-
</p>
<p>ance committee of that system requested that positive
</p>
<p>action be deferred. The general manager expected it
</p>
<p>to go at any moment.
</p>
<p>At Marshalltown, Iowa, the Central Iowa enginemen
</p>
<p>notified Receiver Dudley that they would not handle
</p>
<p>Burlington cars. " The receiver said that his duty
</p>
<p>under the law was plain, and that he should insist on
</p>
<p>its enforcement. He therefore declined to allow any
</p>
<p>cars delivered to him to be set out of trains, and at 5
</p>
<p>o'clock he ordered the machine shops closed, and all
</p>
<p>employes in the shops, roundhouses, offices, and all
</p>
<p>along the road, laid off, except enough to look after
</p>
<p>the passenger service." 2 This virtually tied up the

<p>nooga, Tenn. ; at the same time the Ohio and Mississipi
</p>
<p>w as making an effort to have the Burlington business
</p>
<p>boycotted.
</p>
<p>While these efforts were being made by separate
</p>
<p>systems guided by their own feelings, the Fort
</p>
<p>Scott road, situated by the side of the Santa Fe, "made
</p>
<p>no secret of the fact that it handled all the freight sent
</p>
<p>to it by the Burlington.'" ' In an interview with Vice-
</p>
<p>President C. W. Smith of the Santa Fe, "he ad-
</p>
<p>mitted that several of the stockholders of the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton, including Malcom B. Forbes, and President Per-
</p>
<p>kins of the Burlington, were large holders of the stock
</p>
<p>in the Santa Fe, but he did not consider that fact suffi-
</p>
<p>cient grounds for a strike on the Santa Fe.'' Yet that
</p>
<p>knowledge was without doubt what actuated the San-
</p>
<p>ta Fe men in pursuing the radical course they did. It
</p>
<p>was a combined action of individuals, each actuated by
</p>
<p>one sentiment, to help their brothers of the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton. Mr. Conroe, chairman of the grievance commit-
</p>
<p>tee, was called to Topeka by Governor Martin where
</p>
<p>he met with the Governor and railroad commissioners
</p>
<p>of the state of Kansas. "Governor Martin asked Mr.
</p>
<p>Conroe to state the case of the engineers. He said
</p>
<p>they had no grievance against the Santa Fe, but the
</p>
<p>Burlington men could not hope to win so long as the
</p>
<p>Santa Fe hauled Burlington freight, which he claimed
</p>
<p>the road had been doing." 2
</p>
<p>At the request of the Governor, Mr. Conroe and
</p>
<p>the board of commissioners, held a conference with
</p>
<p>general manager Goddard, of the Santa Fe, in the

<p>hope that an understanding might be reached but the

<p>having ordered the strike and said it was the individ-
</p>
<p>ual action of the men. They had considered the mat-
</p>
<p>ter carefully at their lodges and had decided to strike,
</p>
<p>therefore neither he nor Mr. Arthur could order it off,
</p>
<p>until the strikers gained their point. He was not an-
</p>
<p>tagonizing Mr. Arthur but things were in such shape
</p>
<p>that he could not comply with Mr. Arthur's directions.
</p>
<p>Governor Martin, speaking of Mr. Conroe, said: " My
</p>
<p>interview with him leads' me to believe that he is a
</p>
<p>conservative, level headed, intelligent man. He talks
</p>
<p>sensibly upon the situation, and believes he is acting
</p>
<p>with the best interests of the men he represents. I
</p>
<p>would take him to be a man well informed upon gen-
</p>
<p>eral business affairs, and not a man who desires to
</p>
<p>gain notoriety as an agitator." !
</p>
<p>Mr. Conroe and the Santa Fe men held their ground
</p>
<p>manfully. It was purely a sympathy strike and their
</p>
<p>position was a trying one. Manager Goddard had
</p>
<p>issued a circular letter on the 17th, covering the ground
</p>
<p>of complaint and stated that the company had decided
</p>
<p>to retain the services of all the old men, and would
</p>
<p>give them until the next Thursday to resume work.
</p>
<p>The fairness and generosity of this proposition to men
</p>
<p>who had no personal feeling against the officers, and
</p>
<p>the failure of the Fort Scott men to carry out their
</p>
<p>part of the presumed program, caused the men to feel
</p>
<p>that the strike was ill advised. Much has been said
</p>
<p>against Grand Chief Arthur for requesting the Santa
</p>
<p>Fe men to return to work, yet it was the only wise
</p>
<p>course to pursue. The men could not have main-
</p>
<p>tained their position, standing alone as they were.

<p>official notice, issued at 6 p. m., 18th of March, was
</p>
<p>timely and judicious.
</p>
<p>Kansas City, March 18, 1888.
</p>
<p>To the engineers and firemen of the Santa Fe system:
</p>
<p>" I am advised by our grand chief to request of you
</p>
<p>to return to your respective positions at once. Furth-
</p>
<p>er that I am to repair to Chicago and adjust all misunder-
</p>
<p>standings." '
</p>
<p>I. CONROE,
</p>
<p>Chairman, General Grievance Committee.
</p>
<p>Mr. George Royal, a prominent member of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood, was sent to Kansas City by Grand Chief
</p>
<p>Arthur to assist in bringing about this result which
</p>
<p>ended the strike on the Santa Fe. This strike was a
</p>
<p>mistake. Had they adopted the Union Pacific plan,
</p>
<p>and had taken the "Q colic," it is not likely that they
</p>
<p>would have been discharged, and yet the doors would
</p>
<p>have been closed against the Burlington, and the chief
</p>
<p>object would have been attained. Its redeeming qual-
</p>
<p>ities were that there was no viciousness, no disorder,
</p>
<p>no hatred of the Santa Fe officials, but an unselfish
</p>
<p>devotion to their brothers on the Burlington that out-
</p>
<p>weighed all other considerations  misconceived, but
</p>
<p>grand in good fellowship.
</p>
<p>The Santa Fe strike was over and the Kansas City
</p>
<p>lines began to open to the Burlington business. This
</p>
<p>caused the greatest dissatisfaction in the south and
</p>
<p>west, where the men were all loyal and walling to boy-
</p>
<p>cott, regardless of consequences to themselves, but
</p>
<p>they only saw a portion of the field. They could

<p>maintain their ground without sacrificing many of their

<p>positions, but the situation was not as propitious else-
</p>
<p>where.
</p>
<p>We find the Central Iowa road still in trouble. The
</p>
<p>engineers out on this road only numbered sixty-five,
</p>
<p>and a like number of firemen, but this number suspt
</p>
<p>ed operations for nine hundred other employes, and
</p>
<p>the receiver on the 19th, issued the following notice:
</p>
<p>" All engineers and firemen who fail to report for

<p>duty at 8:00 a. m., Tuesday, March 20, reach and
</p>
<p>willing to haul any and all cars that may be put on
</p>
<p>trains, will be discharged from the service." ' The
</p>
<p>machine shops, car shops, roundhouses, and prrt of
</p>
<p>the general offices had been closed in pursuance of his
</p>
<p>previous order. It was not easy to dissuade men who
</p>
<p>had taken a voluntary stand in the process of the bov-
</p>
<p>cott, but on the 20th this strike was brought to a close
</p>
<p>through a five hour conference between Receiver
</p>
<p>Dudley, a member of the court, and six representatives
</p>
<p>of the Brotherhood. The Burlington, Cedar Rapids,
</p>
<p>& Northern was pushed into line bv a decision in Judge
</p>
<p>Love's court, under the inter- state law. and the strike
</p>
<p>was again closed on the Burlington, and the attention
</p>
<p>again turned towards Chicago.

<p>CHAPTER XLV.
</p>
<p>ANOTHER CLOUD RISING.
</p>
<p>Owing to the many and grave complications that
</p>
<p>were continually arising, that were absolutely beyond
</p>
<p>the control of the grand officers, located, as they were,
</p>
<p>within the limits of the conspiracy law of Illinois, it
</p>
<p>is evident they lost faith in the power to compel a
</p>
<p>settlement upon the original conditions asked, and at
</p>
<p>their suggestion Chairmen Hoge and Murphy made
</p>
<p>another effort, on March 10. They left their pride
</p>
<p>behind and waited upon President Perkins and Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Manager Stone, when it was proposed that the men
</p>
<p>be allow r ed to go back to work on the old terms, with
</p>
<p>the question of increase to be decided upon by amica-
</p>
<p>ble agreement thereafter, but they did not arrive at
</p>
<p>any satisfactory conclusion. The Burlington officials
</p>
<p>declined to negotiate with them upon an)- terms but
</p>
<p>absolute surrender.
</p>
<p>When the embargo was raised on the Santa Fe
</p>
<p>there was great indignation expressed by members of
</p>
<p>the Brotherhood, against the grand officers, for being
</p>
<p>instrumental in accomplishing it. Thomas Jefferson
</p>
<p>said, "When right, I shall often be thought wrong by
</p>
<p>those whose positions will not command a view of the
</p>
<p>whole ground;" so in this case, could all have seen the
</p>
<p>situation as it really was the strike would not have
</p>
<p>lasted another day, but they could not, and the Bur-

</p>
<p>lington strikers along the line were holding their
</p>
<p>344 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>ground as tenaciously as on the first day. Letters
</p>
<p>were being received from all over the country encour-
</p>
<p>aging them to stand firm. Every local point along
</p>
<p>the line had a correspondence committee, and more
</p>
<p>than fifty letters were received and as many sent out.
</p>
<p>It was a mode of feeling the pulse of all the men
</p>
<p>along the line, and the social and encouraging nature
</p>
<p>of the letters kept up the animation and good feeling,
</p>
<p>and furnished the panacea that kept away ennui and
</p>
<p>disgust.
</p>
<p>Laboring men of all creeds, seeing the two most
</p>
<p>powerful organizations extant roughly handled by
</p>
<p>centralized capital, began to see the danger to them-
</p>
<p>selves, and buried much of the feeling that was so
</p>
<p>patent at the beginning of the strike, which had been
</p>
<p>engendered mostly by the engineers' policy of "no en-
</p>
<p>tangling alliances." Amalgamation among diversified
</p>
<p>labor brings as many difficulties as do entangling alli-
</p>
<p>ances among nations. But an alliance which contem-
</p>
<p>plates federated good fellowship, has become essential
</p>
<p>to the welfare of labor, and the strike so far had
</p>
<p>brought vividly to the minds of laboring men gener-
</p>
<p>ally, the necessity of some concerted action that would
</p>
<p>equalize their, power, and make them able to success-
</p>
<p>fully maintain their right, endangered by corporate
</p>
<p>power. The following is the result of this feeling,
</p>
<p>adopted by the Union Pacific employes:
</p>

<p>ment satisfactory to them, they shall comply with the
</p>
<p>laws of their organization regarding grievances and

<p>strikes, and if their action in the matter receives the
</p>
<p>endorsement of their organization, said grievance shall

<p>be submitted to the Federal Board for final action.

<p>Seventh.  An expelled member of either organiza-

</p>
<p>tions on the Union Pacific Railway system, subject to the
</p>
<p>approval of the Chiefs of our several organizations.
</p>
<p>This was signed by eighteen representative men of
</p>
<p>the K. of L., B. of L. E., and B. of L. F.
</p>
<p>In an interview with a reporter, Mr. Powderly said:
</p>
<p>" Any differences which might have been between the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood and myself are at an end. I have no
</p>
<p>right with any labor organization. I would rather
</p>
<p>take a blow from a labor organization than give one.
</p>
<p>Last Saturday I signed articles of agreement between
</p>
<p>members of the Brotherhoods of Engineers and Fire-
</p>
<p>men, and Knights of Labor, employed on the Union
</p>
<p>Pacific railroad. They will work together, and any-
</p>
<p>thing concerning their interests on the road will be
</p>
<p>carefully considered by both sides, and all troubles
</p>
<p>will be settled without strikes if possible." '
</p>
<p>The same disposition had begun to manifest itself
</p>
<p>among the switchmen. They, as a class, never had
</p>
<p>any love for a scab, and it must have been a trying
</p>
<p>ordeal for them to work with them as long as they
</p>
<p>did. An effort had been made at the beginning of the
</p>
<p>strike to secure the co-operation of the switchmen and
</p>
<p>brakemen. "Grand Master Wilkinson, and Grand
</p>
<p>Secretary and Treasurer Oshea of the brakemen, and
</p>
<p>Grand Master Monoghan had expressed sympathy and
</p>
<p>a wish that they could enter the contest, but the past
</p>
<p>policy of the engineers of "going it alone" prevented
</p>
<p>any coalition. But after the boycott had practically
</p>
<p>failed, another effort was made and Grand Masters
</p>
<p>Monoghan and Wilkinson expressed a willingness to
</p>
<p>make an effort. All they required was a pledge from
</p>
<p>Grand Chief Arthur that in case of trouble with the

</p>
<p>switchmen, or brakemen, that the engineers would
</p>
<p>stand by them. Mr. Arthur could not do this, but
</p>
<p>promised to use his influence to bring about co-oper-
</p>
<p>ation at the convention. This effort, like its prede-
</p>
<p>cessor, failed from the same cause  lack of fraternal
</p>
<p>feeling between the engineers and the other orders.
</p>
<p>Later on, however, a better feeling was brought
</p>
<p>about at a meeting of the switchmen attended by
</p>
<p>chairman Hoge and other committeemen. It is rea-
</p>
<p>sonable to suppose that some pledges were made at
</p>
<p>that.meeting which changed the attitude of the switch-
</p>
<p>men. At a meeting held at Turner Hall, composed of
</p>
<p>engineers, firemen and switchmen, plans were ma-
</p>
<p>tured for future action. Paul Morton had said on
</p>
<p>March 20: c; It*s three strikes and out. Next Saturdav
</p>
<p>we shall start our fast trains No. 1 and 15, and then
</p>
<p>our road will be in exactly the same circumstances
</p>
<p>that it was before the men struck." On Friday,
</p>
<p>March 23, appeared the following:
</p>
<p>"The Great Strike Is Over."  "The Burling-
</p>
<p>ton road continues to run. It has surmounted its diffi-
</p>
<p>culties. Its trains are running on time. The manage-
</p>
<p>ment of the road remains in the hands of its officers.
</p>
<p>The public need have no fear. The responsibility for
</p>
<p>its care and comfort is fully assumed by the company.
</p>
<p>The Burlington takes the lead. It was in advance of
</p>
<p>all other lines in establishing dining-car service on its
</p>
<p>through trains. It was in advance of all other lines in

<p>souri River points from 20^ to 15^ hours. It has
</p>
<p>ANOTHER CLOUD RISING. 349
</p>
<p>been progressive in the past. It will lead in the fu-
</p>
<p>ture. If vou admire an institution that has the cour-
</p>
<p>age of its convictions give it your patronage. Com-
</p>
<p>mencing Sunday, March 25th, ' the Burlington's
</p>
<p>Number One' fast train will leave Chicago daily at
</p>
<p>one o'clock p. m."
</p>
<p>These trains had been discontinued since the incep-
</p>
<p>tion of the strike, and they were still destined to dis-
</p>
<p>appoint those who wished quick transit over the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington, as well as the officials who so loudly pro-
</p>
<p>claimed the strike was off. They were evidently not
</p>
<p>prepared for the storm already brewing. The with-
</p>
<p>drawal of the Burlington switchmen the next day,
</p>
<p>March 24, caused the Burlington to announce, "Ow-
</p>
<p>ing to further complications we will not be able to start
</p>
<p>the fast trains as advertised." Business was again
</p>
<p>stopped. The Burlington was obliged to inform its
</p>
<p>connecting roads that they could not receive business
</p>
<p>from them.
</p>
<p>The switchmen were notified that they must return
</p>
<p>to work on Monday, 26th,  Monday was blue Monday
</p>
<p>for the Burlington; it recalled the first days of the
</p>
<p>engineers' strike. No attempt was made in the morn-
</p>
<p>ing to handle freight, the company ostensibly hoping
</p>
<p>that wiser counsels would prevail and that the switch-
</p>
<p>men would return to work before being locked out.
</p>
<p>The limit given by the company, one o'clock, passed
</p>
<p>without a sign from the men. The key was turned in
</p>
<p>the lock, and the company began to hustle around for
</p>
<p>new men to fill the places of those left vacant," '
</p>
<p>Then commenced the scraping up of whatever kind
</p>
<p>of man could be found" no examination was needed.

</p>
<p>Seven, such as they were, were found, and "seven
</p>
<p>freight conductors came to the front, to do by the
</p>
<p>switchmen as many of them had done by the enginemen.
</p>
<p>The conductors seemed to be extremely obedient to
</p>
<p>their laws, as non-combatants." " Three freight trains
</p>
<p>were finally made up and dispatched to the west."
</p>
<p>This was a great falling off from the previous week's
</p>
<p>business of from fifteen to twenty-five freight trains
</p>
<p>daily, and, as a consequence, goods waiting shipment
</p>
<p>were piled up in great quantities. The company de-
</p>
<p>clined to receive more freight for points which could
</p>
<p>be reached by other lines, and confined its efforts to
</p>
<p>reaching points covered only by its own system. It
</p>
<p>also refused perishable freight to and from the points
</p>
<p>on its own lines.
</p>
<p>The switchmen followed suit all along the line of
</p>
<p>the Burlington where there was any large force em-
</p>
<p>ployed. " The calling out of all the switchmen in
</p>
<p>Chicago was talked about; the walk out of the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington was slowly but surely spreading. The men at
</p>
<p>Plattsmouth, Lincoln and East St. Louis went out with
</p>
<p>Chicago on the 24. Aurora, 111., followed, with Coun-
</p>
<p>cil Bluffs, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska; and Galesburg,
</p>
<p>111., following, on the 25th and 26th, and St. Joseph,
</p>
<p>Missouri, April 1, leaving the Burlington with scarce-
</p>
<p>ly any men with which to do business.
</p>
<p>The Burlington officials believed it was Mr. Mono-
</p>
<p>ghan's plan to have all switchmen go out and that he
</p>
<p>would carry it out to the letter. But they said they
</p>
<p>would fight this new trouble, cost what it might.

<p>pany, from the directors in Boston; on March 27, in
</p>
<p>the following resolutions: "The board of directors
</p>
<p>unanimously approve of the President's course during
</p>
<p>the late strike, and consider that it is their duty to
</p>
<p>offer a steady resistance, regardless of consequences,
</p>
<p>to any attempt to take the management of the road
</p>
<p>from the hands of its owners.
</p>
<p>J. M. Forbes, Chairman.
</p>
<p>When directors, after their experience and im-
</p>
<p>mense loss, are as indifferent to cost and consequences
</p>
<p>as this indicates, the result of the action of the switch-
</p>
<p>men at that late day must, of necessity, have but
</p>
<p>one end the loss of place. Had the brakemen and
</p>
<p>switchmen joined issue with the engineers and firemen
</p>
<p>in the start, the Burlington would have been confron-
</p>
<p>ted with almost an impossibility. A knowledge of the
</p>
<p>road bed, its ups and downs, and peculiarities, are as
</p>
<p>essential as the knowledge of the locomotive, and to
</p>
<p>have all green men, must have caused even the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington officials, with all their indifference, to be
</p>
<p>more considerate at least, of the capital they represen-
</p>
<p>ted.
</p>
<p>There is a lesson in the conduct of the Burlington
</p>
<p>strike, that with a little wisdom, might be used to
</p>
<p>greatly benefit railroad labor in the future. The Bur-
</p>
<p>lington officials, with vast resources at their command,
</p>
<p>Pinkerton detectives and police, and the experience
</p>
<p>of a month, were well equipped for this strike. The

<p>scabs already with them, knowing that the switchmen's

<p>come to the Burlington, and at "five o'clock, Tuesday
</p>
<p>352 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>afternoon, fortv-live switchmen had been engaged, and
</p>
<p>information received that many more were on their
</p>
<p>way to Chicago from the Reading road. The Bur-
</p>
<p>lington had only hired one hundred and thirty so far,
</p>
<p>and if it needed more there were still four hundred
</p>
<p>idle switchmen in the Reading region ready to respond
</p>
<p>at anv time.'' ' Had Reading men been as plentiful
</p>
<p>from 1861 to 1865 as they were in 1888, the forces of
</p>
<p>' Lee, ' instead of surrendering to the silent captain,
</p>
<p>would have lowered their colors to a Reading mob, and
</p>
<p>Appomattox would not have found a place in his-
</p>
<p>torv. "
</p>
<p>The Burlington officials expected trouble with the
</p>
<p>switchmen; they seldom do things by halves, and a
</p>
<p>characteristic episode in a switchmen's strike occurred
</p>
<p>Tuesday afternoon at the Stewart avenue station.
</p>
<p>General Superintendent Besler, Assistant Passenger
</p>
<p>Agent Wakely, Train Master Pope, Pay Master Sturg-
</p>
<p>es, Master Mechanic Smith, Superintendent Upham, of
</p>
<p>the Illinois lines, and many other officials, took a trip
</p>
<p>down in the yards to see how the strike was progress-
</p>
<p>ing. They also made preparations to quarter and feed
</p>
<p>the new switchmen and Pinkerton men. The entire
</p>
<p>partv, and a number of reporters, were standing
</p>
<p>around the Stewart avenue station waiting for the
</p>
<p>west bound train for Western avenue. A dozen or
</p>
<p>more of the striking engineers and switchmen stood a
</p>
<p>short distance away. From the earnest conversation
</p>
<p>and gestures, it was evident that the officials were
</p>
<p>recognized.
</p>
<p>A heavy loaded freight train of forty-five cars came
</p>
<p>down the track just ahead of the passenger train.

<p>ANOTHER CLOUD RISING. 353
</p>
<p>The foot board in front of the engine was guarded by-
</p>
<p>four armed Pinkerton men ; there were Pinkerton men
</p>
<p>in the cab, upon the tender; they clung to the brake
</p>
<p>wheels of the freight cars, in fact the train was well
</p>
<p>protected. Superintendent Besler's face wore a satis-
</p>
<p>fied smile as the long train of cars rattled over the
</p>
<p>switches at an eight mile gait. The group of railroad
</p>
<p>men had vanished or separated. The half dozen
</p>
<p>policemen were lost in the contemplation of the small
</p>
<p>army of Pinkerton men.
</p>
<p>As the last few cars were passing the station, the
</p>
<p>rear car faltered a moment and fell behind. The pin
</p>
<p>had been pulled. Superintendent Besler's smile froze
</p>
<p>upon his face, and he made a remark not mentioned
</p>
<p>here. Train Master Pope confirmed his statement.
</p>
<p>A chorus of yells and laughter arose from the railroad
</p>
<p>men and the crowd of loafers. There was a wild
</p>
<p>frantic rush of Pinkerton men, policemen and railroad
</p>
<p>officials for the daring man who had pulled the pin;
</p>
<p>he had vanished into the air. The train was checked
</p>
<p>about three quarters of a mile west, and slowly and
</p>
<p>sadly backed up.
</p>
<p>The action of the switchmen of the Burlington was
</p>
<p>as individuals. At Creston twenty of the thirty-one
</p>
<p>went out. At Quincy seventeen of the twenty-two,
</p>
<p>leaving five, the master of the Union there remaining
</p>
<p>at Galesburg; two remained with the company. "At
</p>
<p>Lincoln twelve switchmen quit on Monday. Seven
</p>
<p>claimed to have quit to attend as delegates a meeting
</p>
<p>of the striking firemen; two gave sickness as an ex-
</p>
<p>cuse, while three admitted they were on a strike. At

<p>St. Joseph, Mo., a switchman was killed by one of the

</p>
<p>scabs and they quit. The fever was contagious, and
</p>
<p>rumors that the Burlington would be boycotted by
</p>
<p>enginemen and switchmen of other roads was heard
</p>
<p>on every hand. Chicago was kept in a condition of
</p>
<p>excited expectation, while the feeling among railroad
</p>
<p>officials in regard to the attitude of their employes
</p>
<p>was one of great nervousness. They had little to say but
</p>
<p>agreed that they had no assurance that their men
</p>
<p>would not walk out at any time.
</p>
<p>There was an atmosphere of decided uncertain ity
</p>
<p>about the Lake shore yards at Forty-third street on
</p>
<p>Thursday afternoon. Everyone expected trouble for
</p>
<p>the reason that there was a belief that a train of Bur-
</p>
<p>lington cars was to be delivered to the Lake shore
</p>
<p>road. A veteran policeman on duty shook his head
</p>
<p>gloomily at the prospect, and said that never before
</p>
<p>had he seen so many idle men ready to take a hand
</p>
<p>in anything that might come along as there were then
</p>
<p>in the district
</p>
<p>From the inception of the Burlington strike, a flood
</p>
<p>of all sorts of men flocked into Chicago, from men
</p>
<p>driven by necessity to the lowest bum element, such
</p>
<p>as always follow in the wake of excitement, and the
</p>
<p>opportunity for this element was offered in the Mil-
</p>
<p>waukee & St. Paul yards when a Burlington engine
</p>
<p>was sent to the Milwaukee yards at Western avenue
</p>
<p>and' Kinzie street to transfer a train of cars just turned
</p>
<p>out of the manufactory. A mob of about two hun-
</p>
<p>dred "made an attack on the engine and drove from
</p>
<p>the cab the Pinkerton officers stationed there to pro-
</p>
<p>tect the scabs. The officers, though well armed, re-

</p>
<p>iency, were rewarded by having their revolvers taken
</p>
<p>away from them and used to beat them over the head.
</p>
<p>Superintendent Besler, of the Burlington, was attacked
</p>
<p>and seriously beaten. The mob was dispersed
</p>
<p>by the arrival of a platoon of city police, and a switch-
</p>
<p>man who had attacked Mr. Besler was taken to the
</p>
<p>station. This was a signal for the St. Paul switch-
</p>
<p>men to quit work. They went in a body to the sta-
</p>
<p>tion and when bail was refused they went out on a
</p>
<p>strike, being joined by the switch engineers and fire-
</p>
<p>men. Later in the day the man was admitted to the
</p>
<p>bail and all was quiet in the yard, but the outlook was
</p>
<p>far from being peaceful."
</p>
<p>On March 29, Grand Chief Arthur left Chi-
</p>
<p>cago for his home in Cleveland. This gave rise to
</p>
<p>all sorts of comments from the press, and much condem-
</p>
<p>nation from members of the Brotherhood. " In rail-
</p>
<p>road circles it was agreed that the departure of Mr.
</p>
<p>Arthur meant one of three things : that he had to go
</p>
<p>to Cleveland owing to the expiration of his. lease
</p>
<p>of the house in which his family lived, or it was as the
</p>
<p>radicals hinted, the beginning of his retirement; or to
</p>
<p>get out of the jurisdiction of the courts in the west.
</p>
<p>The air was filled with all sorts of rumors. Mr.
</p>
<p>Arthur was conservative and believed in orderly
</p>
<p>methods. He was in a position to surve} - the whole
</p>
<p>situation and had made up his mind that the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton men were defeated, and had told them so, but they
</p>
<p>would not have it that way. It is said, "One who
</p>
<p>doubts is already defeated," and it is presumed he
</p>
<p>thought he had accomplished all he could by remain-

</p>
<p>consisting of A. G. Dunn, W. B. Husky, A. W. Lo-
</p>
<p>gan, and W.'R. Hanby, adopted resolutions expressing
</p>
<p>their confidence in Mr. Arthur and their implicit faith
</p>
<p>in his judgment, and indorsed his action throughout.
</p>
<p>This left the headquarters of the Burlington strike with
</p>
<p>Messrs. Hoge and Murphy; Grand Master Sargent
</p>
<p>remaining as an advisor.
</p>
<p>"On Saturday, at the headquarters of the striking
</p>
<p>switchmen at Fourteenth and Jefferson streets, the room
</p>
<p>was filled with striking engineers, firemen, and switch-
</p>
<p>men, all day, and the prevailing sentiment was opposed
</p>
<p>to the violence of the day before. They said it was not
</p>
<p>their purpose to interfere in any manner with the com-
</p>
<p>pany, and they would not countenance any act of vio-
</p>
<p>lence by their men. But the yard men were full of
</p>
<p>strike all over the city. Committees were there from
</p>
<p>the Fort Wayne, Pan Handle, and North- Western, and
</p>
<p>announced their intention of emphatically refusing to
</p>
<p>handle Burlington cars, and to quit work if the com-
</p>
<p>panies required them to do so."
</p>
<p>The Burlington having obtained a sufficient number
</p>
<p>of switchmen to begin business again, determined to
</p>
<p>push the issue, and to call upon the Pittsburg and
</p>
<p>Fort Wayne, the Lake shore and Michigan southern,
</p>
<p>the Rock Island, the Illinois Central, and Alton roads
</p>
<p>for assistance to raise the blockade in its yards. There
</p>
<p>seemed to be an understanding on nearly all the roads
</p>
<p>that they would strike before they would handle Bur-
</p>
<p>lington freight. The Burlington directors in Boston had
</p>
<p>made up their minds to wreck the property of the
</p>
<p>Burlington and bankrupt themselves, rather than

</p>
<p>aspect. Burlington cars had been standing i n the
</p>
<p>yards for days and that company was now bound to
</p>
<p>push the other companies into a light or into court,
</p>
<p>under the inter-state commerce law. There seemed
</p>
<p>to be no escape for the other companies, the Rock
</p>
<p>Island being the only one to take a positive stand
</p>
<p>against the Burlington.
</p>
<p>The St. Paul strike was confined to the Chicago
</p>
<p>yards; the officials, having gathered up men along the
</p>
<p>line, on Saturday had eight switch engines at work,
</p>
<p>manned by conductors, machinists and railroad police
</p>
<p>who had been engineers or firemen. " About nine
</p>
<p>o'clock a. m., the first switch engine was brought out.
</p>
<p>Two St. Paul special police officers were on each end,
</p>
<p>and two more took care of the cab. It steamed slow-
</p>
<p>ly down to the coal bins and got coal. The new hand
</p>
<p>was not very brisk at the throttle and called out main-
</p>
<p>comments from the strikers, but no attempt was made
</p>
<p>to interfere. They coupled on to a few cars and
</p>
<p>steamed away at a funeral pace." '
</p>
<p>Fifty men who were regular freight and passenger
</p>
<p>conductors on the Council Bluffs division, arrived at
</p>
<p>the roundhouse in the morning. They were brought
</p>
<p>by the St. Paul people to fill the places of the strik-
</p>
<p>ing engineers, firemen and switchmen, and all seemed
</p>
<p>anxious to pull the throttle or throw a switch. Jerry
</p>
<p>Doherty, one of the leaders of the switch engineers,
</p>
<p>went to the roundhouse and talked with the men and
</p>
<p>gained their sympathy, and they declared they had
</p>
<p>never scabbed a day in their lives, and never would.
</p>
<p>Doherty was ordered away by one of the blue coats,

<p>but Mr. Doherty told him he wanted to get his time

<p>were not so anxious to do switching as they had been.

</p>
<p>refused to obev the order and was in turn discharged.
</p>
<p>Finding that the company was in earnest, the remain-
</p>
<p>ing crews in the yard ran their engines into the round-
</p>
<p>house and quit work. One hundred and seventy-rive
</p>
<p>men were employed in the Fort Wayne yard. Soon
</p>
<p>after a crew was found and the objectional train moved
</p>
<p>without opposition from the strikers.
</p>
<p>An attempt was made by the strikers to draw the
</p>
<p>passenger engineers and firemen into the strike. The
</p>
<p>first crew leaving at 2 : 20 p. m. would not join them.
</p>
<p>At 3:30 however a crew refused to take the train

<p>the switchmen also reached Kansas City, and the

<p>officials of roads running into that city were notified

<p>not to handle Burlington cars." ' It looked as though
</p>
<p>there would be no limit to the extent of this move-
</p>
<p>ment
</p>
<p>"A mixed train of twenty cars from the Sixteenth
</p>
<p>street yards of the Burlington, arrived at the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central yards at Randolph street at 10: 30 a. m., Mon-
</p>
<p>day, and was delivered without trouble to that com-
</p>
<p>pany. It was followed around by a large crowd of
</p>
<p>idlers who expected to see fun, but they were disap-
</p>
<p>pointed, for there was not the slightest interference
</p>
<p>offered the train at any point along the route between
</p>
<p>the two yards. As soon as the train approached the

<p>Michigan Central yards the engineers on the Illinois

<p>ANOTHER CLOUD RISING. 361
</p>
<p>The officials of the Michigan Central gave the men
</p>
<p>notice and had limited the time for them to decide
</p>
<p>whether they would handle Burlington cars or not,
</p>
<p>and at a meeting Sunday night the men voted to go
</p>
<p>out at 7 o'clock Monday morning.
</p>
<p>In the morning the forty engineers, firemen, and
</p>
<p>switchmen in the yards of the Michigan Central, at
</p>
<p>the foot of Lake street, with the exception of two
</p>
<p>non-brotherhood engineers, refused to handle the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington cars sent in the day previous. The men went
</p>
<p>to work at seven o'clock as usual, but upon a notice
</p>
<p>being sent them a half hour later that "Q" cars must
</p>
<p>be handled they all quit with the exception of the two
</p>
<p>non-brotherhood men, and in ten minutes the entire
</p>
<p>business of the yards was suspended. The next work
</p>
<p>the strikers started in to accomplish was to subdue the
</p>
<p>two engineers who had declined to be counted in as
</p>
<p>strikers. There was a disposition on the part of sev-
</p>
<p>eral switchmen to exercise their pugilistic powers on
</p>
<p>these two, but the better sentiment prevailed, and the
</p>
<p>striking forces marched away to hold a conference at
</p>
<p>Randolph street and Michigan avenue.
</p>
<p>In the meantime the company was not idle and in
</p>
<p>response to Superintendent Brown's dispatches seven-
</p>
<p>ty-five engineers, firemen and brakemen from Jack-
</p>
<p>son and Detroit, Mich., came in at once. There were
</p>
<p>various and conflicting rumors regarding the attitude
</p>
<p>of these men toward the company, but Superintendent
</p>
<p>Brown said that if the old men did not return to work
</p>
<p>in an hour the new men would take their places.

<p>This was emphatically denied by the Michigan train-

</p>
<p>knowing what disposition was to be made of them.
</p>
<p>At any rate both sides seemed desirous of avoiding
</p>
<p>trouble, and at 9 o'clock Superintendent Brown sent
</p>
<p>a message to the strikers to the effect that the Detroit
</p>
<p>and Jackson men were desirous of holding a joint
</p>
<p>meeting, to arrive, if possible, at some definite conclu-
</p>
<p>sion. Before the communication was. sent, however,
</p>
<p>Miles McHugh, the leader of the party from Michigan,
</p>
<p>told Mr. Brown that his delegation was not in Chica-

</p>
<p>strikers, and that they were as much opposed to
</p>
<p>handling " Q ,: freight as the regular men were.
</p>
<p>These preliminaries over, however, the conference
</p>
<p>was entered into, and for three hours both sides were
</p>
<p>behind closed doors in the superintendent's office.
</p>
<p>While this meeting was in progress, word was re-
</p>
<p>received from Kensington, where the south branch
</p>
<p>yards of the company are situated, that the live en-
</p>
<p>gines there had ceased transferring freight, and that
</p>
<p>the twenty-four men there, five engineers and firemen
</p>
<p>and fourteen yardmen, had gone out as soon as the
</p>
<p>news of the strike at the north end of the line was
</p>
<p>received.
</p>
<p>At nine o'clock Freight Agent Nichols issued the
</p>
<p>following, which was sent to all the roads:
</p>
<p>"Until further advised we cannot receive any more
</p>
<p>freight or cars from you. Will let you know as soon
</p>
<p>as we are ready to receive again.

</p>
<p>This ended one strike, but the day was an eventful
</p>
<p>one.
</p>
<p>"General Manager Miller, of the St. Paul road,
</p>
<p>issued orders to reduce the forces on that line, and to
</p>
<p>lay off every employe whose services were not abso-
</p>
<p>lutely necessary to cany on the business of the road.
</p>
<p>This affected nearly 7,000 men, "and in addition to this,
</p>
<p>an order was issued to reduce the salary of every man
</p>
<p>in the employ of the company, including the general
</p>
<p>manager. Such an order was unexpected and caused
</p>
<p>at consternation among the employes." '
</p>
<p>Judge Gresham issued an order to Milton Knox and
</p>
<p>"William Briggs, two Belt Line engineers, restraining
</p>
<p>them from refusing to promptly haul Burlington cars.
</p>
<p>A ease was brought against the Rock Island road by
</p>
<p>the Burlington in Judge Gresham's court. The Rock
</p>
<p>Island, however, had its switches locked and spiked
</p>
<p>against Burlington business. The union and non-un-
</p>
<p>ion switchmen of the Lake Shore road were at outs,
</p>
<p>because of a threat by one of the union men. The
</p>
<p>switchmen were out, or ready to go out, at the slight-
</p>
<p>est provocation, on nearly all the roads entering Chi-
</p>
<p>cago. The Michigan Central strike had been only of
</p>
<p>a few hours duration, and amid all this confusion and
</p>
<p>turmoil, it was discovered that some one, or more men,
</p>
<p>had issued a circular and sent it to the train men out
</p>
<p>along the road in the following: "We advise you to
</p>
<p>handle all cars regardless of who makes up the trains
</p>
<p>in the yards." It was openly charged that this ema-
</p>
<p>nated from the advisory board of engineers, but
</p>
<p>whether so or not, it was like a bomb shell in the
</p>
<p>camp. The Milwaukee had got tired of waiting, and

</p>
<p>had concluded to discharge the old men and take on
</p>
<p>new, and the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago
</p>
<p>men were not much better off. Men who had ev-
</p>
<p>idently helped by their promises and encouragement
</p>
<p>to get the switchmen out, when it came their turn to
</p>
<p>make a sacrifice were found wanting.
</p>
<p>The fruit of discord, " demoralization," began to be
</p>
<p>apparent. It was evident to the leaders that some-
</p>
<p>thing must be done or this single handed, headless
</p>
<p>contest, would sacrifice the positions of half the good
</p>
<p>men in Chicago. Grand Master Sargent and Grand
</p>
<p>Master Monoghan, and the two chairmen of the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington strikers, Messrs. Hoge and Murphy, held a
</p>
<p>conference and resolved to make an effort to put a
</p>
<p>stop to this if possible, and get the men all back to
</p>
<p>work. This was no trifle, as many of them were in
</p>
<p>an ugly mood. But it was election day and the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington concluded it would not be politic to force
</p>
<p>the issue as the police were nearly all on duty at the
</p>
<p>polls, and business was wofully stagnated by the strike,
</p>
<p>so that a majority of the men could attend the meet-
</p>
<p>ing which was held in Turner hall, in the afternoon.
</p>
<p>The two Grand Masters, bent upon sparing no effort
</p>
<p>to bring order out of chaos, attended this meeting,
</p>
<p>accompanied by General Manager Jeffery, the man-
</p>
<p>ager of all managers, who had the most influence
</p>
<p>with the laboring men. Stirring addresses from these
</p>
<p>three men brought the desired result, and the men
</p>
<p>were ready to go back to work, but all was not yet
</p>
<p>done: they must have the consent of the officials of
</p>
<p>these roads before they could go back. This work

<p>Chairman Hoge, and C. Nay lor, master of Lodge 244,
</p>
<p>of Chicago, waited on General Manager McCray, of
</p>
<p>the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne & Chicago, and finally
</p>
<p>secured consent for the men to go to work in the
</p>
<p>morning. x\ll cars were to be handled, and the same
</p>
<p>relations were to exist as before the strike. The
</p>
<p>Michigan Central men were already back. But the
</p>
<p>Milwaukee road was in a bad condition; the road had
</p>
<p>suffered considerable loss. General Manager Miller
</p>
<p>had tried hard to keep the road out of trouble, and he
</p>
<p>felt that he had been badly treated. He was in no
</p>
<p>humor to be approached with a proposition to the
</p>
<p>affect that the men would go to work if he should
</p>
<p>reinstate them all to their former positions. These
</p>
<p>gentlemen finally succeeded. The men went to work
</p>
<p>at seven o'clock, April 4, and the boycott in Chicago
</p>
<p>was raised, and the strike confined -to the Burlington.
</p>
<p>The St. Paul employes who had been ordered sus-
</p>
<p>pended, were also ordered back at their old wages,
</p>
<p>and the wheels of traffic were again set in motion.
</p>
<p>The raising of the boycott caused much feeling, among
</p>
<p>those who could not see the difficulties of the situation.
</p>
<p>The effort was made by the switchmen with honest
</p>
<p>and good intentions, but they w r ere too late to be useful
</p>
<p>to those in whose interest they were made, and Grand
</p>
<p>Masters Sargent and Monoghan are deserving, not of
</p>
<p>condemnation, but great praise, for putting a stop to
</p>
<p>this futile effort, saving the men's plaees. and ending
</p>
<p>the opportunity it offered to criminals and desperadoes

<p>beset men of labor, there appeared in the Chicago
</p>
<p>Mail, of April 2, a long circular letter which the Marl
</p>
<p>said. " was intended for railroad managers only, but in
</p>
<p>view of the complications in railroad circles, the Mail
</p>
<p>deemed it proper to make public: "
</p>
<p>"The advance sheets from the report of the grand
</p>
<p>secretary of the Order of Railway Conductors have
</p>
<p>been sent out to the managers of the various rail-
</p>
<p>roads."
</p>
<p>"By way of preface the grand secretary says: I
</p>
<p>am directed by the executive committee of the Order
</p>
<p>of Railway Conductors to send advance sheets of a
</p>
<p>portion of my ninth annual report to the general offi-
</p>
<p>cers of the principal railways in the United States, in
</p>
<p>order that the position of our association in regard to
</p>
<p>labor troubles and strikers in general, and the strikes
</p>
<p>of engineers in particular, shall be fully understood by
</p>
<p>them. In taking this position we make no claim to a
</p>
<p>philanthropic feeling toward, or love for, railway com-
</p>
<p>panies. The conductors feel, and with good reason in
</p>
<p>many cases, that they do not receive justice from the
</p>
<p>companies, that the lovaltv toward their employers
</p>
<p>in times of trouble in the past has not been apprecia-
</p>
<p>ted; but they recognize the fact that to assist the en-
</p>
<p>gineers or any other class of employes in procuring
</p>
<p>more than justice is to assist in placing it beyond the
</p>
<p>power of railway officers to give to the conductor the
</p>
<p>recognition and remuneration that they believe he is
</p>
<p>entitled to."

<p>loudly professed has been plainly illustrated on more

</p>
<p>upon the treatment accorded your representatives at
</p>
<p>Chicago, when by the direction of the grand division,
</p>
<p>a communication was addressed to them on the mat-
</p>
<p>ter of license. To this respectful communication not
</p>
<p>the slightest reply has ever been made. They come
</p>
<p>to you holding out the right hand of friendship, but in
</p>
<p>their left hand they held the dagger to stab you at the

<p>first opportunity."
</p>
<p>"It has been asserted in th^ Railway Conductor's
</p>
<p>Monthly that a large majority of the conductors of the
</p>
<p>United States are capable of successfully running loco-
</p>
<p>motives and the assertion is made here, without fear
</p>
<p>of successful contradiction, that if it were not for the
</p>
<p>unreasonable prejudice existing in regard to taking
</p>
<p>another's place and the false sympathy in regard to

<p>'taking the bread out of a brother's mouth' the place

<p>of every member of the Brotherhood of Locomotive

<p>Engineers in the country could be suceessfullv rilled

<p>be more intelligent men than they are at present."
</p>
<p>"It is time for the conductors to teach railway offi-
</p>
<p>cers what the engineers themselves already well
</p>
<p>know and are anxious to conceal  that nine-tenths of
</p>
<p>the conductors of the United States are capable and
</p>
<p>trustworthy engineers. The conductors on the Chica-
</p>
<p>go, Burlington & Quincy have already demonstrated
</p>
<p>this, and they are ready to do it on other roads. I
</p>
<p>hope sincerely that the time is close at hand when
</p>
<p>they will not only be ready but willing to do so all

<p>over the United States."

<p>dence goes to show that the animus contained in this
</p>
<p>did not emanate from the conductors' order, but from
</p>
<p>the individual, the Grand Chief Conductor. It is true
</p>
<p>he was sustained at the convention held in Toronto,
</p>
<p>Canada, but there are always men at the conventions
</p>
<p>that follow the leader rather than their own convictions.
</p>
<p>Strong speeches were made in opposition to the Grand
</p>
<p>Chief Conductor's position. Delegate Ransom said
</p>
<p>among other things. " These organizations have ad-
</p>
<p>vanced the interests of the laboring man. The Grand
</p>
<p>Chief Conductor has said that where his report was
</p>
<p>written all was turmoil and unquiet, and it was written
</p>
<p>in an atmosphere different from what he found in
</p>
<p>Canada, admitting that had he been in peaceful Can-
</p>
<p>ada that the objectional portion of the report would
</p>
<p>never have been written. I beg the members to de-
</p>
<p>cide upon the subject matter of the report, and to con-
</p>
<p>sider the grand chief upon the same basis that he
</p>
<p>would place any other member, when he had so con-
</p>
<p>siderately stepped down from the chair to defend him-
</p>
<p>self, thereby admitting that his course needs defense;
</p>
<p>do not permit the fact that it is the report of the grand
</p>
<p>officer to deter you from condemning any language
</p>
<p>calculated to array this body against any other organ-
</p>
<p>ization whatever; and do not take any action calculated
</p>
<p>to cause trouble where there is now peace and har-
</p>
<p>mony." '
</p>
<p>The report was sustained, but the harm of it did not
</p>
<p>remain within the walls of the convention. When
</p>
<p>printed it created immense feeling among labor organ-
</p>

<p>cord where before had been harmony; incisive remarks
</p>
<p>made by those actuated by passion, as was Chief
</p>
<p>Wheaton, widened the breach. The seed sown was
</p>
<p>reaped in the formation of a new order of conductors
</p>
<p>called the Conductors' Brotherhood, and its growth
</p>
<p>has been astonishing.
</p>
<p>The real cause of the feeling on the part of Messrs.
</p>
<p>Wheaton and Daniels, was their effort to have passed
</p>
<p>a license law. Circulars had been sent to all divisions
</p>
<p>of the Brotherhood, asking their support, but the con-
</p>
<p>ditions contained in the bill were such that the}' did not
</p>
<p>consider it to their interest to do so. The same was
</p>
<p>presented to the engineers' convention at Chicago,
</p>
<p>where Mr. Wheaton claims he did not receive the re-
</p>
<p>spect he deserved. There are twenty-eight sections
</p>
<p>in this bill. The first section prohibits any railroad
</p>
<p>company employing any but licensed conductors and
</p>
<p>engineers. Sections two to nine inclusive, relate to an
</p>
<p>army of examiners, who, under this bill, would become
</p>
<p>United States officers.
</p>
<p>Sec. 10. Every railway conductor, and every loco-
</p>
<p>motive engineer, who receives a license hereunder,
</p>
<p>shall, before entering upon the discharge of his duties,
</p>
<p>make and subscribe an oath before one of the examin-
</p>
<p>ers herein provided for, that he will faithfully and hon-
</p>
<p>estly, according to his best skill, judgment and ability,
</p>
<p>perform all the duties required of him by law.
</p>
<p>Sec. 11. Every railway conductor and every loco-
</p>
<p>motive engineer who shall receive a license as herein
</p>
<p>provided for, when employed upon any railway, shall

<p>keep such license, and shall upon request of any passen-

</p>
<p>for every neglect to comply with this provision by any
</p>
<p>such railway conductor or locomotive engineer, he
</p>
<p>shall be subject to a fine of one hundred dollars, or to
</p>
<p>the revocation of his license.
</p>
<p>Sections twelve to twenty-one relate to examiners.
</p>
<p>Sec 22. If any licensed officer shall, to the hin-
</p>
<p>drance of commerce, wrongfully or unreasonably re-
</p>
<p>fuse to serve in his official capacity on any railway, as
</p>
<p>authorized by the terms of his certificate of license, or
</p>
<p>shall fail to deliver to the applicant for such service, at
</p>
<p>the time of such refusal, if the same shall be demand-
</p>
<p>ed, a statement in writing, assigning good and suffici-
</p>
<p>ent reasons therefor, his license shall be revoked, up-
</p>
<p>on the same proceedings as are provided in other
</p>
<p>cases of revocation of such license.
</p>
<p>Sections twenty-three to twenty-eight, inclusive, fix
</p>
<p>salaries of examiners, etc. The whole bill looks more
</p>
<p>like an effort to make room for office, than to benefit
</p>
<p>the railroad employes. It only adds complications to
</p>
<p>those that already beset railroad men and offers
</p>
<p>nothing to better their condition. It was so peculiarly
</p>
<p>useless and unfitting in its application, that it called out
</p>
<p>the following from the fertile brain of Bill Nye, in the
</p>
<p>Louis Post Dispatch, of which we give extracts:

</p>
<p>iners, retaining only the bitter anguish and enervating

<p>window all day and patiently accumulates mileage."
</p>
<p>"The chief examiner, and supervising examiner shall
</p>
<p>constitute a national board of examiners, who shall

<p>presence of two districts examiners, and the}' shall be

<p>questions and be willing to work on a salarv. They

<p>shall receive a salary of $2,000 a year, mileage, sta-

<p>also be required to wear a muzzle during dog days.

<p>Conductors on receiving their license will be required

<p>to subscribe to an oath in substance as follows:"
</p>
<p>"The schedule of examination has not yet been fixed,
</p>
<p>but it must be so prepared that it shall cover the phy-
</p>
<p>sical and mental conditions of the applicant, and will

<p>overhauled by congress; I also do further swear, and
</p>
<p>set forth, that I will be a good, fathful conductor to the
</p>
<p>best of my ability, and that I will wear such badges as
</p>
<p>my health will permit, providing my bosom is wide
</p>
<p>enough, and that I will report promptly to Washington
</p>
<p>every day, what is said on my train that might be of
</p>
<p>political interest, and that I will assist in defraying
</p>
<p>campaign expenses, be kind and courteous at all times
</p>
<p>to chief examiner, district examiner, acting examiners,
</p>
<p>assistant examiners or breath testers, who may be en-
</p>
<p>route, and that I will love, honor and obey them as
</p>
<p>long as we both shall live. (Signed) A. B. I only
</p>
<p>ask, on behalf of several anxious friends, what has be-
</p>
<p>come of this bill, and whether it is, or is not now a
</p>
<p>law, and if not, why not. Bill Nye."
</p>
<p>The hits of Nye upon the conditions asked for in
</p>
<p>this bill are forcible, and under his ridicule there is
</p>
<p>reason. No class of laboring men should quarrel
</p>
<p>because some individual was not supported in an
</p>
<p>effort to pass a law, in order to furnish official places.
</p>
<p>State license has enough politics in it, but would be a
</p>
<p>benefit to both engineers and conductors, and add
</p>
<p>safety to the public, but a license recognizing your
</p>
<p>knowledge and ability need not imply the abrogation
</p>
<p>of individual liberty. The Burlington strikers had a
</p>
<p>heavy load to carry  all their own troubles, and the
</p>
<p>slurs of every one who had a grudge against any indi-
</p>
<p>vidual who belonged to the 30,000 who composed the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood  but they stood their ground; and as the
</p>
<p>strike had been confined to the Burlington road, let us
</p>
<p>look along the line.

<p>CHAPTER XLVI.
</p>
<p>RAILWAY AND WAREHOUSE COMMISSIONERS.
</p>
<p>" A complaint signed by fifty-two citizens and
</p>
<p>"business firms of Aurora had been filed with the Rail-
</p>
<p>road and Warehouse Commission in which the com-
</p>
<p>plainants say : ' We are informed and belive that nu-
</p>
<p>merous engineers and firemen now in the employ of
</p>
<p>the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Company, and en-
</p>
<p>gaged in running trains through this city, are unfit and
</p>
<p>incompetent to perform the duties of their respective
</p>
<p>positions, and that thereby the lives and property of
</p>
<p>people patronizing said railroad are daily endangered.
</p>
<p>We therefore respectfully request that you will imme-
</p>
<p>diately cause an examination to be made into the
</p>
<p>truthfulness of the above matter, and take such action
</p>
<p>as may be by law required.' Among the signatures
</p>
<p>are those of Charles Wilson. John J. Davis, O. C.
</p>
<p>Pease, Titus, Marshall & Co., H. Knapp, Andrew
</p>
<p>Welch, J. M. Kennedy, C. Abel, Hall and Ballard, and
</p>
<p>James Shaw." '
</p>
<p>The first case before the commissioners was that of
</p>
<p>W. H. Pierce, which has been given on page 181.
</p>
<p>The next was Hosea DeWitt. " Hecter H. Hall
</p>
<p>testified he had known him ei^ht vears, that he was
</p>
<p>an habitual drunkard, and that his (De Witt's) wife
</p>
<p>had been to all saloons, forbidding them to sell him
</p>
<p>anything." x The evidence of his habits was corrob-
</p>
<p>orated by Stewart H. Haddock and John B. Clark.

<p>there not ? A. There is an air guage.
</p>
<p>Let me ask you, is it the duty of an engineer to
</p>
<p>watch the air guage as well as watch his steam guage?
</p>
<p>I should think he ought to.
</p>
<p>Why didn't you do it ? Well, I don't really know
</p>
<p>why I didn't. The time is so short.
</p>
<p>Was it because you were not accustomed to running
</p>
<p>an engine ? Well, that may have been the case.

</p>
<p>a locomotive  do you think you would have noticed

</p>
<p>firemen at any time in your life, before this date on
</p>
<p>any road ? That is to draw pay for it ?
</p>
<p>To draw pay for it and perform its duties regularly ?
</p>
<p>No, sir.
</p>
<p>It was stated repeatedly by the officials that "no
</p>
<p>men were taken without thorough examination" and
</p>
<p>some said, "none were taken who had not had at
</p>
<p>least a year's experience as locomotive engineers."
</p>
<p>Something had to be said to quiet the fears of the
</p>
<p>public and the Burlington officials did their full duty
</p>
<p>in doing whatever was necessary to defeat the Broth-
</p>
<p>erhood. Had they followed their rules, which were in
</p>
<p>use prior to Feb. 27, they could not possibly have
</p>
<p>tilled their places. The Brotherhood felt that the tight'
</p>
<p>was unfair, and they secured an investigation both in
</p>
<p>Illinois and Iowa, by the railroad commissioners, to
</p>
<p>show what kmd of men they were taking so that the
</p>
<p>public might know how much one side was adhering
</p>
<p>to their principles and the other violating them. The
</p>
<p>report of the railroad commissioners of Iowa was
</p>
<p>made to Governor Larrabee which induced the Gover-

</p>
<p>that further delay, in adjustment of the difficulties ex-
</p>
<p>isting between the management of the C, B. & Q.
</p>
<p>road and its striking employes, would be a manifest in-
</p>
<p>justice to the people of our state. In the territory
</p>
<p>controlled by your road, traffic is deranged and travel
</p>
<p>inconvenienced to such an extent as to demand a
</p>
<p>speedy solution of the difficulty. I therefore appeal to
</p>
<p>you in behalf of the people of Iowa, to make every
</p>
<p>effort possible to come to an understanding with the
</p>
<p>strikers. It appears to me that even self-interest
</p>
<p>should dictate such a course to you, and especially as
</p>
<p>your company can be held responsible for damages
</p>
<p>caused by failure to furnish reasonable facilities tor the
</p>
<p>transaction of business on your lines of road; allow me
</p>
<p>to suggest, that unless you soon succeed in some way
</p>
<p>to secure a settlement, you submit the case to arbitra-
</p>
<p>tion." ' Yours Respectfully, *
</p>
<p>William Larrabee.
</p>
<p>The Burlington officials were not inclined to arbi-
</p>
<p>tration. They were going to fight it out regardless of
</p>
<p>damage or inconvenience.

<p>CHAPTER XLVII.
</p>
<p>DESTRUCTION AND DISCORD.
</p>
<p>"At Aurora, 111., March 27, at 8:15 p. m., the whis-
</p>
<p>tle at the Burlington shops was blown as a tire alarm,
</p>
<p>and in a few seconds a lurid flame shot up into the sky,
</p>
<p>and it was easy to be seen that one of the large
</p>
<p>buildings of the Burlington shops was on tire. It
</p>
<p>proved to be the coach paint department structure,
</p>
<p>which was entirely destroyed inside of an hour. The
</p>
<p>firemen worked hard and did noble service in prevent-
</p>
<p>ing the blaze from spreading to the surrounding
</p>
<p>buildings, many of which were afire a dozen times or
</p>
<p>more. The demolished shop was only built a year or
</p>
<p>so before, was 90 x 330 feet, and one half of it
</p>
<p>had been partitioned off for hotel purposes by the
</p>
<p>company for the accommodation of the new engineers
</p>
<p>recently employed."
</p>
<p>"Berths were provided for 216 men, and more than
</p>
<p>half that number were in the building, when the fire
</p>
<p>started. They were forced to jump from their beds
</p>
<p>and get out the best they could. A new pay car just
</p>
<p>completed at a cost of $4,000, and six coaches, were
</p>
<p>destroyed, as were the tools of the men. The loss
</p>
<p>was fully $50,000. The fire was caused by the ex-
</p>
<p>plosion of a kerosene lamp. According to the report of
</p>
<p>one of the night watchmen, when the lamp exploded in
</p>
<p>the varnish room, used as lamp room, it was at once dis-

</p>
<p>covered by night watchman John Lowe, and special
</p>
<p>$86 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>policeman Quackenbush, who in attempting to wipe
</p>
<p>out the fire with a pair of overalls scattered it so
</p>
<p>much that the room was all ablaze in a few seconds.
</p>
<p>The inflammable froods which were stored there caused
</p>
<p>a conflagration that was absolutely uncontrollable, and
</p>
<p>only prompt action confined the destruction to the
</p>
<p>building in which the fire originated." 1 In speaking of
</p>
<p>this fire, Mr. Morton said: "We have not the least
</p>
<p>doubt that this thing was the work of the Aurora
</p>
<p>strikers. Perhaps they wanted to damage the com-
</p>
<p>pany, but I think their main object was to burn out
</p>
<p>the new men who were housed there." 2 This was
</p>
<p>enough from which to manufacture a specific charge
</p>
<p>that the strikers burned the paint shop. It being im-
</p>
<p>possible to give the same notorietv to the facts, as had
</p>
<p>been given to the first report, that charge is still in the
</p>
<p>minds of many, and is still doing injustice to those
</p>
<p>men, as I heard the charge repeated in July, 1889. "A
</p>
<p>committee was appointed by the mayor of Aurora to
</p>
<p>investigate the cause and they found that the evidence
</p>
<p>all proved that the fire started in the corner of the
</p>
<p>room where the lamps were trimmed; that there was
</p>
<p>no evidence that a combustible was, or could have
</p>
<p>been, thrown into that part of the building; that there
</p>
<p>was no evidence of assaults or riotous conduct during
</p>
<p>the fire, and that the fire was undoubtedly of an acci-
</p>
<p>dental origin. R. W. Gates. John F. Thorwarth,
</p>
<p>committee."
</p>
<p>In the excitement of the time it was natural, to
</p>
<p>charge everything to the strikers, and such charges
</p>
<p>were easier made and believed than the truth was,
</p>
<p>when found out.

<p>DESTRUCTION AND DISCORD. 387
</p>
<p>The Burlington had built a temporary boarding
</p>
<p>house in Chicago for the new men. Mr. Morton said:
</p>
<p>"We have found it necessary to put up temporary
</p>
<p>barracks for these men and place them under prote< -
</p>
<p>tidn.'" But we would rather mistrust that the real
</p>
<p>difficulty was shown in the following:
</p>
<p>A THREE CORNERED FIGHT.
</p>
<p>[HE NEW SWITCHMEN, the PINKERTON FORCES, AND THE CITY
</p>
<p>POLICE DO NOT PULL TOGETHER.
</p>
<p>" There is at present a great deal of ill feeling
</p>
<p>among the non-union switchmen, the city police, and
</p>
<p>thePinkerton men at the Western avenue yards of the
</p>
<p>' Q' road. The feud arose some time ago when the
</p>
<p>Pinkerton men showed signs of dissatisfaction when
</p>
<p>they were put in too close contact with the new
</p>
<p>switchmen, who were classed as being ' a set of tramps *
</p>
<p>by the tony deputies. As soon as the switchmen found
</p>
<p>out that their company was not desired by the Pinker-
</p>
<p>tons, they immediately took the part of aggressors and
</p>
<p>seemed anxious that a crisis should be reached. The
</p>
<p>deputies learned that the switchmen were not in a
</p>
<p>very healthy sanitary condition and did not associate
</p>
<p>with them at all. Even on the trips over the road the
</p>
<p>deputies would try to keep a couple of car-lengths
</p>
<p>away from those occupied by the switchmen. At meal
</p>
<p>times a Pinkerton man and a ' Q ' switchman can
</p>
<p>never be found sitting at the same table. When all
</p>
<p>the seats are taken, except one near the deputies, a
</p>
<p>switchman will never take it, but wait until some
</p>
<p>other seat is vacated so that he will not sit near pne of
</p>
<p>his guardians.""
</p>
<p>" The matter reached a most bitter state when the

</p>
<p>city police became involved in it. They not only re-
</p>
<p>fused to associate with the deputies but with the
</p>
<p>switchmen also. They set up a general protest when
</p>
<p>they learned that the switchmen were infested by a
</p>
<p>tribe of vermin, which proved to be very irritating
</p>
<p>after a few day's sojourn in camp." '
</p>
<p>It is possible boarding houses might not want such
</p>
<p>company. The crowding process of the Burlington
</p>
<p>officials under the inter-state commerce law created
</p>
<p>much feeling between the Burlington officials and those
</p>
<p>of other roads. A case was brought against the Chi-
</p>
<p>cago, Rock Island & Pacific, to compel them to handle
</p>
<p>Burlington cars. " The Rock Island's attorney, Rob-
</p>
<p>ert Lincoln, made answer charging the Burlington
</p>
<p>with cutting rates to compel the formation of a trust in
</p>
<p>violation of the inter-state law.
</p>
<p>"Attorney Withrow said they could also prove the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington refused concessions to its men allowed by other
</p>
<p>roads, merely to bring about a general strike, and put
</p>
<p>competing roads in a mood to submit to the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton. If we have made any wrong charges, he said, it
</p>
<p>is the power of this company to put us in confusion
</p>
<p>before the whole world by going before a master.
</p>
<p>The Burlington makes a pet aversion of the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood of Engineers. Now we may get indignant as
</p>
<p>much as we please at the so called despotism of these
</p>
<p>organizations, but we have been living under the des-
</p>
<p>potism of coal combinations and cotton combinations,
</p>
<p>and the like; now this combination of the engineers is
</p>
<p>alegalone. They have the right to quit work. After
</p>
<p>six weeks scouring, if the Burlington can't get compe-
</p>
<p>tent engineers, what prospect is there for us, or for

</p>
<p>another road, if we provoke a quarrel with our men?
</p>
<p>Continuing, he said, the Burlington had so much of the
</p>
<p>Boston flavor about it, that it fancied all other roads
</p>
<p>were run for its convenience, and it would not do
</p>
<p>what it wanted others to do. The Rock Island was
</p>
<p>solvent and might better pay for the cars than stop its
</p>
<p>whole system and injure thousands of people." '
</p>
<p>"At the conclusion Judge Gresham said, even if the
</p>
<p>allegations made by the Rock Island were true, it did
</p>
<p>not relieve that road from its duty as a common carri-
</p>
<p>er. Again, he did not think the Rock Island had re-
</p>
<p>fused to do its duty. The ' Q ' did not need protection
</p>
<p>from this, its strongest competitor. As there was no
</p>
<p>danger of injury accruing to the ' Q ' road, no injunc-
</p>
<p>tion would be issued just now. The future develop-
</p>
<p>ments, he said, might alter this.
</p>
<p>The unpleasantness of the strike penetrated high
</p>
<p>quarters. Everybody was in a mental state to make
</p>
<p>strong statements. With the boycott raised, the case
</p>
<p>was dropped by mutual consent. The strike was off on
</p>
<p>all otner lines, and the Burlington had given notice there
</p>
<p>would be no more pilots. Business was expected to be
</p>
<p>good on the Burlington, as the gates were once more
</p>
<p>opened. The men employed by the Burlington were
</p>
<p>charged with incompetency by the Brotherhood, which
</p>
<p>was strenuously denied by the Burlington. There is
</p>
<p>an old saying that the workman is known by his chips.
</p>
<p>We have already recorded several mishaps.  We shall
</p>
<p>try to give only important ones, so that the readers
</p>
<p>may judge for themselves, whether incompetent labor
</p>
<p>is profitable in railroad service. We have said before
</p>
<p>that wrecks were avoided in a very great measure by

<p>THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>the presence of pilots, who were old trainmen, and
</p>
<p>many engines were kept from being burned by the
</p>
<p>same assistance, but engines were burned and plenty
</p>
<p>of them. More grates were burned in one week,
</p>
<p>than before the strike in one year. On the Hannibal
</p>
<p>cSr St. Joseph division, first week, engine No. 20 was
</p>
<p>run through the roundhouse at Kansas City, knock-
</p>
<p>ing down wall and landing in the street. Engine 29,
</p>
<p>burned very badly; flues had to be reset. Engine 66
</p>
<p>on passenger train, after going five miles, could go no
</p>
<p>farther; could not work injector; master mechanic took
</p>
<p>switch engine and went after him to show him how. In
</p>
<p>March, engine 67, had injector pipes frozen up, bursted,
</p>
<p>engine towed back to Brookfield, dead. Engine 39,
</p>
<p>passenger train No. 3, Engineer Reed, Conductor
</p>
<p>Fitzgerald, was lost to dispatcher between Round
</p>
<p>Grove and Macon. After* a long time waiting engine
</p>
<p>came into Macon without train, could just get on to
</p>
<p>side track, another engine was sent for and the 39
</p>
<p>remained on siding for a week before it was taken away.

<p>Engine 34. Cooked at Utica, Mo.; engine was

<p>losing- front end head light and stack, besides damage
</p>
<p>to Rock Island train. No one discharged.
</p>
<p>March 27, at 12:45 a. m., Charles Poole, a switch-
</p>
<p>man, was killed in Brookfield yard, Farley engineer.
</p>
<p>Poole was jerked off car and run over. Coroner was
</p>
<p>not notified, and body was' shipped to his relations in
</p>
<p>Illinois without inquest. Poole lived fifty-two hours;
</p>
<p>was nursed by Martin Culleton.
</p>
<p>April  Engine 34, Engineer Simpson, Conductor
</p>
<p>Garrity. ran into rear of train No. 9, breaking up front
</p>
<p>end of engine, and causing such damage as naturally
</p>
<p>accompanies such accidents.
</p>
<p>Engine 37, Engineer Wood, Conductor Birdsall,
</p>
<p>engine broke down at Breckenridge. Wood, in trying
</p>
<p>to disconnect, cut off bolt heads in strap and tried to
</p>
<p>drive the bolts down through. Every engineer will
</p>
<p>appreciate his difficulties in this effort with a tapered
</p>
<p>bolt, but he did not propose to be behind the times, so
</p>
<p>he took a chisel and drove under strap and pried it
</p>
<p>up, and straightened it to get it off.
</p>
<p>Engines 1 and 48 collided in Brookfield yard: loss,
</p>
<p>two cylinders. Engine 43 was run into turn table pit
</p>
<p>at Winthrop, Mo. Engine 65, off switch at Cameron,
</p>
<p>lost pilot. Engine 67 lost pilot in yard at St. Joseph,
</p>
<p>Mo. Engine 61 broke spring hanger at Osborn, de-
</p>
<p>laved train two hours and twenty minutes. If we add
</p>
<p>to this, a large list of grates burned, eccentrics cut,
</p>
<p>guides cut, brasses burned out, incompetent disconnect-
</p>
<p>and blocking of guides, that did more damage

<p>caping steam, and he barely escaped being burned to
</p>
<p>death as the wreck took fire immediately. Engineer
</p>
<p>Markham, who was pulling the second section with
</p>
<p>engine 20, stood at his post and escaped uninjured.
</p>
<p>His fireman, E. S. Robbins, of Denver, Colorado,
</p>
<p>jumped and was struck in the back by a box car. He
</p>
<p>is seriously, but it is thought not fatally injured. The
</p>
<p>two injured men are being cared for at the Wallace
</p>
<p>house, by Dr. T. H. Hughes. Brakeman Theihoff was
</p>
<p>on the caboose but jumped off just in time to save his
</p>
<p>life. Brakeman Sevy, whose home is in Clarence,
</p>
<p>was thrown from the top of the train but escaped with
</p>
<p>only a few scratches. The caboose, an empty box-
</p>
<p>car and two cars of corn were totally destroyed by
</p>
<p>fire, and the engine is a complete wreck. The wreck-
</p>
<p>ing train arrived from Brookfield at 2:30, and at 6
</p>
<p>o'clock the side track was cleared so as to let the
</p>
<p>night passengers by. The signal lights on the ca-
</p>
<p>boose could be seen for at least three fourths of a
</p>
<p>mile, and if the engineer had called for brakes when
</p>
<p>he first saw the lights the train might easily have been
</p>
<p>stopped.
</p>
<p>A bad accident occurred at Pacific Junction at 3
</p>
<p>o'clock this morning (12th inst.) The Burlington &

</p>
<p>Creston, Ia., April 15.  The fast mail train on
</p>
<p>the Burlington road collided with a freight about one
</p>
<p>mile west of here early this morning, on a curve just
</p>
<p>beyond a bridge, and the engineer of the passenger train
</p>
<p>had only time to apply the air brakes before jumping.
</p>
<p>C. A. Shoot, fireman of the freight train was instantly
</p>
<p>killed and the engineer, J. M. Osborne, was slightly
</p>
<p>injured. Brakeman Henry Gibbons had a leg crushed
</p>
<p>and L. J. Miller was internally injured. Both en-
</p>
<p>gines were totallv wrecked. Two mail cars were
</p>
<p>thrown down an embankment and burned, together
</p>
<p>with the bridge. The mail clerks were rescued unin-
</p>
<p>jured.
</p>
<p>The coroner's jury in this case rendered a verdict as
</p>
<p>follow's: "Said jurors upon their oath do say, after
</p>
<p>having heard the evidence, and examined the said
</p>
<p>body: We find that the deceased came to his death on

</p>
<p>J. M. Osborne. The negligence of conductor Ann-
</p>
<p>strong consists in his falling asleep while on duty, but
</p>
<p>from the evidence we find that he had been kept on
</p>
<p>duty continuously for about fifty-four hours, which in
</p>
<p>the minds of the jury would unfit him for the respon-
</p>
<p>sibilities; and we further find Engineer Osborne was
</p>
<p>grossly negligent in running his engine without time,
</p>
<p>his watch having run down at 2:55 a. m., two minutes
</p>
<p>before leaving Corning station, as shown by the train
</p>
<p>record. We further find him incompetent as an engi-
</p>
<p>neer, from his lack of knowledge to construe the time
</p>
<p>as-shown by the time card. "

</p>
<p>The verdict fixed the blame chiefly upon the scab
</p>
<p>engineer, J. M. Osborne, who was pronounced grossly
</p>
<p>negligent and incompetent. Regarding the latter qual-
</p>
<p>ity the following facts were brought out:
</p>
<p>"He had run on west division since March 17, but
</p>
<p>did not yet know the names of all stations without
</p>
<p>schedule or distance between stations. Named five
</p>
<p>stations between Council Bluffs and Creston: could
</p>
<p>not say whether Cromwell was registering station or
</p>
<p>not; run through Cromwell because he was signaled
</p>
<p>to go ahead, he thought, by the operator."
</p>
<p>He looked at his watch and time card at Cromwell,
</p>
<p>and it was 2:55 exactly. He had two hours to make
</p>
<p>Creston from Nodaway, twenty miles. He was pos-
</p>
<p>itive of the time at Cromwell. He was more careful
</p>
<p>this trip than any that he had ever made before, be-

<p>DESTRUCTION AND DISCORD. 39J
</p>
<p>There were hundreds of minor mishaps that were
</p>
<p>chargeable to incompetency. We only give the more
</p>
<p>expensive and dangerous for the sake of comparison,
</p>
<p>so the reader may judge which is the cheaper, good
</p>
<p>wages and competent labor, or incompetent labor,
</p>
<p>and the disaster that accompanies it for the sake of sav-
</p>
<p>ing, "We run our own business and allow no dictation
</p>
<p>or arbitration." In Harpers Weekly of April 21, appears
</p>
<p>an article from Mr. W. D. Howells, a writer known and
</p>
<p>read from one end of the Union to the other. lie
</p>
<p>writes from the standpoint of a stockholder in the C,
</p>
<p>B. & Q. railroad, takes decided grounds in favor of
</p>
<p>arbitration, and is not flattering to that management, in
</p>
<p>the last paragraph, which persists in looking upon a
</p>
<p>railroad's affairs as private affairs. His article is as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>" With grief that I think must be shared by a good
</p>
<p>many other holders of Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
</p>
<p>stock, I saw that stock go down from 129 to 112
</p>
<p>under the effect of the private war waged between the
</p>
<p>railroad and its engineers and switchmen. I am told
</p>
<p>by the press that the loss was through the fault of
</p>
<p>these employes of the road, and that its officers illus-
</p>
<p>trated a beneficent principle in standing firm against
</p>
<p>them and refusing their demands. The principle was
</p>
<p>that the road had a right to manage its private affairs
</p>
<p>in its own way."
</p>
<p>" But here, I think, is an error. A railroad has,
</p>
<p>strictly speaking, no private affairs. It is a corpora-
</p>
<p>tion which in return for certain franchises has assumed
</p>
<p>certain obligations, and before all corporate rights it

<p>has these public duties. It ought to consider these

</p>
<p>alwavs, and from the beginning; but it is said that
</p>
<p>when early in the war the opposite faction offered to
</p>
<p>submit its claims to arbitration, the officers of the C,
</p>
<p>I). & Q. replied that there was nothing to arbitrate.
</p>
<p>If this was true, it is a great pit)-, and I believe a great
</p>
<p>mistake. There is no question here of the road's
</p>
<p>treatment of its employes, but if these thought them-
</p>
<p>selves underpaid, and the road thought they paid them
</p>
<p>enough, it was the very moment for arbitration."
</p>
<p>" That truly christian device for averting public war
</p>
<p>has now been successfully tried, and it seems to me it
</p>
<p>would have been well to use it in the danger of the
</p>
<p>private war which has embarassed travel and com-
</p>
<p>merce on the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, and
</p>
<p>spread loss far and wide. It is in qualitv of a timid
</p>
<p>capitalist that I write; and I wish to say that I have no
</p>
<p>particular affection for the Brotherhood of Engineers;
</p>
<p>it has before now shown itself short-sighted and selfish,
</p>
<p>and in its betrayal by the Knights of Labor it is said
</p>
<p>to be paying the penalty of a treason of its own. But
</p>
<p>however this may be, it is unquestionably a power
</p>
<p>lawfully organized for defense and offense, and it was
</p>
<p>the part of policy for the opposing force to recognize
</p>
<p>its strength. It was also a duty to do this in view of
</p>
<p>its obligations to the public, which neither of the
</p>
<p>belligerents in the case has considered. The road was
</p>
<p>bound to come to any tolerable accommodation with
</p>
<p>its employes, so that the public might not suffer. The
</p>
<p>quarrel, so far as it concerned the engineers, was
</p>
<p>between them and the road; but as concerned the
</p>
<p>road, it did not end there; the community was an im-

</p>
<p>which had a sovereign claim upon its service."
</p>
<p>"When the strike began, I suppose that nearly
</p>
<p>every humane person said to himself, ' Well between
</p>
<p>men who want to make a better living and a corpo-
</p>
<p>ration that wants to make more money I can have no
</p>
<p>choice.' I said something like this myself, not re-
</p>
<p>membering my C, B. & Q. stock in my magnanimity.
</p>
<p>But of course when the strike came, as strikes must,
</p>
<p>to involve violence, the general sentiment changed,
</p>
<p>and many lectures have been read to the engineers on
</p>
<p>their misbehavior, but. to the road none. That is my
</p>
<p>reason for attempting to read it a little one now, to
</p>
<p>remind it that it is the creature of public favor, with
</p>
<p>duties to the public which it had no right to fail in
</p>
<p>through any mistaken sense of its corporate dignity or
</p>
<p>interest. I dare say that the engineers' strike against
</p>
<p>it will end, as all strikes have hitherto ended, in disas-
</p>
<p>ter to the strikers. But I am sure that strikes will
</p>
<p>not always end so. It is only a question of time, and
</p>
<p>of a very little time, till the union of labor shall be so
</p>
<p>perfect that nothing can defeat it. We may say this
</p>
<p>will be a very good time or a very bad time; all the
</p>
<p>same it is coming. Then the question will come with
</p>
<p>it: Shall the railroads fulfill their public obligations by
</p>
<p>agreement with their employes, or shall the govern-
</p>
<p>ment take possession of them and operate them ? It
</p>
<p>is folly to talk of the withdrawal of capital, and the
</p>
<p>consequent ruin of the country. The country belongs
</p>
<p>to the people, and they are not going to let it be ruined.
</p>
<p>Their possession of the railroad would involve much
</p>
<p>trouble and anxiety, but the railroad receiver, who is

</p>
<p>" But let us understand that it is not engineers or
</p>
<p>switchmen or brakemen who can bring it to the worst;
</p>
<p>it is only directors, and managers, and presidents who
</p>
<p>refuse to arbitrate, and w r ho forget their public duties
</p>
<p>so far as to talk of a railroad's affairs as private
</p>
<p>affairs." W . D. Howells.
</p>
<p>Owing to the natural sympathies of the people in
</p>
<p>the cities along the line where they were best acquaint-
</p>
<p>ed with the strikers, the company threatened to move
</p>
<p>shops away or close them up, in order to drive them
</p>
<p>into line, and compel them to furnish special police and
</p>
<p>stop any demonstration in the strikers' favor. " Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Superintendent Brown, at Creston, received orders
</p>
<p>to close the machine shops and prepare to run trains
</p>
<p>through the city, if the authorities did not take imme-
</p>
<p>diate steps to protect the company's employes." 1
</p>
<p>The strikers had some of the new employes arrested
</p>
<p>for carrying concealed weapons, and the Creston
</p>
<p>Advertiser of April 3, said; "Superintendent Duggan
</p>
<p>has been furnishing security for thugs and bullies con-
</p>
<p>victed of carrying concealed weapons. The signifi-
</p>
<p>cance of his remarks to an Advertiser man, that there
</p>
<p>would be blood spilled over this yet, is beginning to be
</p>
<p>more fully understood, and we are now convinced
</p>
<p>that he was better posted on the claret market than
</p>
<p>the press representative. Thanks to the vigilance of
</p>
<p>the police, his braggart employes have, as yet, failed
</p>
<p>to carry out the prophecy of their superior." This threat

<p>to boycott the cities was made all along the line. At

<p>to Chillicothe, Mo. This scare worked on the minds
</p>
<p>of the people so that at the municipal election, prohi-
</p>
<p>bitionists voted the free whiskey ticket, because the
</p>
<p>prohibition candidate was an honorary member of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood.
</p>
<p>Because one out of more than a hundred strikers
</p>
<p>at Brookfield had committed an unmanly and unlawful
</p>
<p>act in striking a scab with his walking stick, a law
</p>
<p>and order meeting was called "April 20, 1888, at 2
</p>
<p>o'clock p. m., for the purpose of taking such action as
</p>
<p>is necessary to uphold the civil authorities of our city
</p>
<p>and country in the enforcement of law, and the sup-
</p>
<p>pression of vicious, violent idlers in our midst." ' This
</p>
<p>wholesale condemnation of these men who had been
</p>
<p>citizens, some of them for twenty-five years, created
</p>
<p>much feeling.  As it was a call for citizens, the strik-
</p>
<p>ers attended in a body, and were there promptly at
</p>
<p>the appointed time, and occupied the reserved seats.
</p>
<p>An effort had been made to get as good an attend-
</p>
<p>ance as possible by those issuing the call; the men em-

<p>ployed in the company's shops were invited, and a
</p>
<p>special effort was made to have the new men there to

<p>chairman elected, and a resolution read by an attorney
</p>
<p> who was retained by the company as its legal
</p>
<p>advisor  condemning lawlessness and the strikers by
</p>
<p>implication, offering taffy to the railroad officials and a
</p>
<p>hearty welcome to the new men. After the resolu-
</p>
<p>tion was read and passed, the strikers not voting, the
</p>
<p>chair asked if there was any further business. No
</p>
<p>speakers responding from the other side, the strikers
</p>
<p>called for a speaker, who responded in, a short speech
</p>
<p>questioning the justice or propriety of calling a meet-
</p>
<p>ing to condemn such men as he saw before him
</p>
<p>among the strikers, who had been with the city and
</p>
<p>helped build it from its infancy. This speech pleased
</p>
<p>the strikers, and put a wet blanket on the promoters
</p>
<p>of the meeting. But the next speaker put them to
</p>
<p>route with ridicule, and a motion was made to adjourn.
</p>
<p>The new men present did not like the outcome, and
</p>
<p>after the meeting adjourned one of them, named Mur-
</p>
<p>ray, who had been welcomed to the city by the reso-
</p>
<p>lution of the meeting, ran two brakemen off the streets
</p>
<p>with his revolver; complaint was made and this nice
</p>
<p>new comer was taken in by the Marshal, and put
</p>
<p>under $100 bond to appear the next morning. He
</p>
<p>appeared the next morning and was given a dose of

<p>whitewash and let go  no cause of action. The strik-

<p>ers, after such a wholesale condemnation by the law

</p>
<p>doing ; all they asked was that the law should take its

<p>conditions they would withdraw the prosecution, their
</p>
<p>only object being to show the one-sided legal proceed-
</p>
<p>ings. If the new man would make an acknowledge-
</p>
<p>ment, pay all cost, and agree to leave the city, they
</p>
<p>would be satisfied. They wanted law and order; the
</p>
<p>law was being perverted and used to the detriment
</p>
<p>of the strikers, and the protection of the scabs. The
</p>
<p>police judge had found nothing against this man and
</p>
<p>liberated him, but the state's attorney had found too
</p>
<p>much evidence and the prisoner was glad to choose
</p>
<p>between leaving, and working for the state. Was the
</p>
<p>meeting called for law and order or was it called in
</p>
<p>fear of a great corporation? At Aurora, 111., April 14,
</p>
<p>1888, at ameeting held in the city council room, resolu-
</p>
<p>tions were passed and committees appointed to circulate
</p>
<p>the petition on both sides of the river which the com-
</p>
<p>mittee says under the date of April 24. "I can assure
</p>
<p>vou was thoroughly done. I give you below the
</p>
<p>names of those who were 'men' enough to sign it." 1
</p>
<p>This petition asked the mayor to put on 30 to 100
</p>
<p>special policemen at the city's expense. To many
</p>
<p>business men, the necessity did not seem to exist,
</p>
<p>and they refused to sign it. The Burlington officials

</p>
<p>tribution to their scabs, and on a slip was written
</p>
<p>with a type writer twenty-five names of business men
</p>
<p>who would not sign the petition, and one of these was
</p>
<p>handed into each house to be boycotted so they would
</p>
<p>be sure to know it. I have both documents obtained
</p>
<p>from one of the new men. A bulldozing policy was
</p>
<p>practiced in court and out, all along the line, and the
</p>
<p>influence that controls legislatures was never more ap-
</p>
<p>parent than in the Burlington strike. . Fear on one
</p>
<p>hand, and money where that would not do, secured
</p>
<p>power along the line, not warranted by any considera-
</p>
<p>tion of justice.
</p>
<p>The aggressive policy of the Burlington was bring-
</p>
<p>ing organized labor nearer together each day. Meet-
</p>
<p>ings were being held in all parts of the country. " At
</p>
<p>New York, April 8.  Members of the Brotherhood
</p>
<p>of Locomotive Engineers and Locomotive Firemen to
</p>
<p>the number of 1,500 met at Tammany Hall
</p>
<p>J. J. Hanahan, Vice-Grand Master of the locomotive
</p>
<p>firemen, and Joseph Porter of the engineers of the C,
</p>
<p>B. & Q. system, addressed the meeting and told what
</p>
<p>they had seen and heard on a recent trip over the C,
</p>
<p>B. & Q. system from Chicago to Denver. Mr. Porter
</p>
<p>declared the losses already amounted to a million of
</p>
<p>dollars. Among other things he declared that already
</p>
<p>157 engines had been disabled through incapability of
</p>
<p>the ' scab engineers.' Remarks were also made by
</p>
<p>leading members of eastern divisions of the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood of Engineers and Firemen. The meeting unan-
</p>
<p>imously adopted these resolutions: "
</p>

<p> Second. That our pledge of financial and moral
</p>
<p>support to our striking brothers of the C, B. & Q.
</p>
<p>railroad is hereby renewed and will be continued as
</p>
<p>long as necessary."
</p>
<p>Like meetings were held in all large business centers,
</p>
<p>and similar resolutions passed. An appeal had been
</p>
<p>sent out over the Burlington system, which was signed
</p>
<p>by thousands of business men asking " the Inter-State
</p>
<p>Commerce Commission to take action on the ' Q '
</p>
<p>strike in reference to the mismanagement of the Bur-
</p>
<p>lington and the interference with the traffic of the
</p>
<p>country. Judge Cooley, chairman of the commission,
</p>
<p>has consented to an investigation. Mr. Alexander
</p>
<p>Sullivan, the attorney for the Brotherhood of Locomo-
</p>
<p>tive Engineers, was preparing the evidence to be sub-
</p>
<p>mitted."
</p>
<p>As a further evidence that the two Brotherhoods
</p>
<p>were not disheartened, the following is significant :

<p>"St. Louis, Mo., April 14.  The grievance com-
</p>

</p>
<p>three and one-half cents per mile on passenger, and four
</p>
<p>cents per mile on freight trains, with the abolishment
</p>
<p>of all classification."
</p>
<p>" The terms of this settlement are exactly what the
</p>
<p>"striking engineers and firemen on the Burlington asked
</p>
<p>for. The Brotherhood men are to be congratulated
</p>
<p>upon having won a substantial victory, and St. Louis

<p>fairness and great good sense."
</p>
<p>406 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>" Grand Master Sargent arrived at headquarters in
</p>
<p>the Grand Pacific from St. Louis Thursday morning.
</p>
<p>In respect to the concessions made by the St. Louis &
</p>
<p>San Francisco road, he said; ' One strike has been
</p>
<p>averted; twelve hundred engineers and firemen con-
</p>
<p>tinue to work with their condition bettered, and the
</p>
<p>' Frisco line running out of St. Louis, over 1,446 miles
</p>
<p>of western territory, is no worse for the conference it
</p>
<p>gave a committee of employes, and the subsequent
</p>
<p>settlement which it magnanimously agreed to. The
</p>
<p>enginemen on the ' Frisco line had submitted to the
</p>
<p>officials of that road a set of resolutions almost exactly
</p>
<p>the same as were laid before the Burlington manage-
</p>
<p>ment. Within five days from the date of which the
</p>
<p>paper was received by him, General Manager Mor-
</p>
<p>rill expressly desired to settle with the men themselves,
</p>
<p>and for that reason there was no need of myself nor
</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur being present. His conduct is deserving
</p>
<p>of much praise."
</p>
<p>When interviewed, Mr. Sargent said: " Don't forget
</p>
<p>to say that the same request was made that caused the
</p>
<p>strike on the ' Q.' That was the abolishing of classifi-
</p>
<p>cation and the adoption of a mileage system as a basis
</p>
<p>for wages. . This point was agreed to at once."
</p>
<p>" When Paul Morton, of the Burlington road, was
</p>
<p>asked why his company could not have settled the
</p>
<p>Burlington difficulty the same way, and thus avoided
</p>
<p>a strike, he turned to his desk and wrote the following
</p>
<p>reply : "
</p>
<p>" I am glad to hear that the ' Frisco strike is settled
</p>
<p>peaceably. The probability is that if our men had

</p>
<p>presented modified demands before striking we would
</p>
<p>DESTRUCTION AM) DISCORD. 4O7
</p>
<p>have had no trouble. Our strike is settled, too, but in
</p>
<p>another way, and it has clearly demonstrated the old
</p>
<p>adage that it takes two to make a bargain."
</p>
<p>" There ! 'That's my answer 1 , said he, handing
</p>
<p>over the paper."
</p>
<p>In this answer Mr. Morton forgot that the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton would allow no second party to the contract, and a
</p>
<p>strike resulted.
</p>
<p>" On the 19th, J. J. Hanahan, Vice-Grand Master of
</p>
<p>the Brotherhood of Firemen, returned from a trip
</p>
<p>through the principal cities and terminal points of the
</p>
<p>east, where he held joint meetings and found a warm
</p>
<p>welcome, and on every hand the greatest enthusiasm
</p>
<p>and warm commendation of the course of the officers
</p>
<p>of the Brotherhood. The members pledged any sup-
</p>
<p>port, financial or moral, that might be necessary, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Hanahan bt ought back the equivalent of $250,-
</p>
<p>000 in cash. Mr. J. Porter, of Aurora, accompanied
</p>
<p>Mr. Hanahan. They were followed on the trip by
</p>
<p>Burlington detectives, and evaded them at several
</p>
<p>points, only to be overtaken again.
</p>
<p>Mr. Morton again declares the strike off:
</p>
<p>Chicago, 111., April 13, 1888.
</p>
<p>Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co.,
</p>
<p>Passenger Dept.
</p>
<p>.To Ticket Agents.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen:  Commencing Saturday, April 14,
</p>
<p>the Burlington fast train will be resumed. The strike
</p>
<p>is over. Our engineers are thoroughly competent.
</p>
<p>These trains will be run on time as heretofore.

<p>CHAPTER XLVI1I.
</p>
<p>THE STRIKE NOT OFF.
</p>
<p>Paul Morton had said the strike was off and every-
</p>
<p>thing was running smoothly as before the strike.
</p>
<p>But the statement of Messrs. Hoge and Murphy, the
</p>
<p>spilling of blood, and public opinion, would indicate
</p>
<p>that it was still on.
</p>
<p>At Galesburg, 111., on the 28th of April occurred the
</p>
<p>killing of H. B. Newell, one of the striking* engineers,
</p>
<p>by sfun shot wounds from a revolver in the hands of
</p>
<p>William Albert Hedburg, a Burlington scab fireman.
</p>
<p>At the coroner's inquest, as was the case always where
</p>
<p>the Burlington was interested, and contrary to common
</p>
<p>usage, lawyers employed by the company were on
</p>
<p>hand necessitating the presence of other lawyers, and
</p>
<p>at this inquest " a confab arose as to who Mr. Brown,
</p>
<p>who was conducting the examination, represented.
</p>
<p>The coroner then demanded who all the attorneys
</p>
<p>represented. Mr. Brown said that he represented the
</p>
<p>people at the request of friends; Mr. Lawrence said
</p>
<p>that he and Mr. Williams represented Mr. Hedburg;
</p>
<p>Mr. Carney said that he represented the city of Gales-
</p>
<p>burg; Mr. Welch said that he was there at the request
</p>
<p>of parties interested and proposed to stay. The
</p>
<p>squire then said that there had been considerable criti-
</p>
<p>cism on allowing attorneys present and their asking
</p>
<p>questions. He had admitted it so that the examina-

</p>
<p>tion might be thorough and searching. Mr. Cooke
</p>
<p>THE STRIKE NOT OFF. 4O9
</p>
<p>offered to withdraw, if there was any objection to his
</p>
<p>representing the State. The matter was finally
</p>
<p>smoothed over and the inquest proceeded. "
</p>
<p>The inquest lasted three days. State's Attorney
</p>
<p>Cooke remarked that the inquest seemed to have been
</p>
<p>run by the defense. The jury brought in a verdict
</p>
<p>that the shooting was done in self-defense. A war-
</p>
<p>rant was immediately sworn out by a brother, A. 15.
</p>
<p>Newell, charging Hedburg with murder, and the pris-
</p>
<p>oner was held to the grand jury.
</p>
<p>The Funeral of Herbert B. Newell.
</p>
<p>" The funeral service over the remains of Herbert
</p>
<p>B. Newell was held at the house on East Main street
</p>
<p>at ten o'clock this forenoon. It was probablv one of
</p>
<p>the largest funerals ever held in Galesburcr. The
</p>
<p>house, yard, and walk were thronged with people. It
</p>
<p>is estimated that not less than one thousand persons
</p>
<p>were on the grounds."
</p>
<p>"There were several tine floral offerings, perhaps the
</p>
<p>most prominent being the one representing the drive-
</p>
<p>wheel of a locomotive, with one of the spokes broken,
</p>
<p>and the initials,  B. of L. E.' and ' Div. No. 62',
</p>
<p>worked in flowers. This emblem was very suggest-
</p>
<p>ive and stood at the head of the coffin. There was
</p>
<p>also a harp made largely of calla lilies and roses at the
</p>
<p>head of the coffin. At the foot there were two beauti-
</p>
<p>ful pillows of white flowers. In one, in immortelles,
</p>
<p>was the word ' Herb,' and in the other one ' Newell.'
</p>
<p>The services were opened by a quartette consisting of
</p>
<p>Messrs. Manning, Fleharty, Fairbank, and L. H. Jelliff,

</p>
<p>THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>then read several selections from the scriptures, after
</p>
<p>which the quartette sang c Last Good Night.' Rev.
</p>
<p>Bradshaw then, without taking any text, made a short
</p>
<p>address. The following is a synopsis of the first part
</p>
<p>of his remarks : '
</p>
<p>" ' We are gathered under the shadow of a great and
</p>
<p>shocking calamity  a calamity which has cast its
</p>
<p>gloom not upon us alone who are assembled here, but
</p>
<p>upon the whole community. One of those appalling
</p>
<p>occurrences which shock our deepest emotions, which
</p>
<p>kindle excited feeling; which tend to unsettle the
</p>
<p>judgment of the calmest and most judicious. At
</p>
<p>such a time it behooves all right-minded men and wo-
</p>
<p>men to summon into exercise their utmost self-control;
</p>
<p>to quiet excited emotion; to suppress every trace of
</p>
<p>passionate feeling, to give calm judgment full sway;
</p>
<p>to let their words be few and cautious, and their ac-
</p>
<p>tions most discreet. He who should act otherwise
</p>
<p>would, by so doing, make himself the enemy of the
</p>
<p>best and most sacred interests of society. Of the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances attending this sad occurrence, this is nei-
</p>
<p>ther the time nor the place to speak. Not till by lapse
</p>
<p>of time excited feeling has been stilled; not till, view-
</p>
<p>ing these events from a distance, we are able more
</p>
<p>accurately to perceive the true relations of things; not
</p>
<p>till, by passage of time, calm judgment is restored
</p>
<p>and truth fully brought to light, can anyone wisely
</p>
<p>speak of these sad circumstances or venture to pass
</p>
<p>judgment upon them.' "
</p>
<p>" In closing Mr. Bradshaw spoke comforting words
</p>
<p>to the bereaved and urged the necessity of preparing

</p>
<p>for death while we still have health and opportunity."
</p>
<p>THE STRIKE NOT OFF. 4II
</p>
<p>" After Rev. Bradshaw's address the quartette sang
</p>
<p>'Beautiful Land.' The house was then cleared and
</p>
<p>the family and relatives of deceased took their last
</p>
<p>look. The remains were then brought out and
</p>
<p>placed on the sidewalk and all given a chance to view
</p>
<p>them. The Brotherhoods marched two abreast and
</p>
<p>as they came to the coffin they clasped hands and
</p>
<p>passed each side of the remains. Over 300 thus filed
</p>
<p>past the coffin. There were visitors here from Bur-
</p>
<p>lington Div. No. 151, Marshalltown Div. No. 146, St.
</p>
<p>Paul Div. No. 150, Aurora Div. No. 32, and Beards-
</p>
<p>town Div. No. 127."
</p>
<p>" The procession down Main street was a solemn,
</p>
<p>magnificent and imposing one. The streets were
</p>
<p>lined with spectators, and the utmost silence prevailed.
</p>
<p>It was shortly before 12 o'clock when the line of
</p>
<p>march reached the business center. At the front was
</p>
<p>the Galesburg Marine band, playing a beautiful funer-
</p>
<p>al march very smoothly and impressively. The mar-
</p>
<p>shals of the line preceded them, and were Mr. Robert
</p>
<p>Barnhill and Mr. Thomas McGann. Then was seen
</p>
<p>the crimson banner of the Switchmen's lodge. There
</p>
<p>were in line some 60 of these, including the delegation
</p>
<p>from Burlington and other points. Each wore around
</p>
<p>his sleeve a piece of crape. On their hands were
</p>
<p>white gloves. The next banner was the elegant one
</p>
<p>of the B. of L. F., and of those marching behind the
</p>
<p>banner proclaiming "Benevolence, Sobriety and Indus-
</p>
<p>try'' there could not have been less than one hundred
</p>
<p>and fifty, including the visiting brethren. Each, as
</p>
<p>were also the switchmen, was adorned with the rega-

<p>lia of the fraternity as well as the symbols of sorrow.

<p>412
</p>
<p>THE Bl'KLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>The long line of engineers came next, and they were
</p>
<p>the center of all eyes. The beautiful, brotherhood
</p>
<p>banner at their head was gracefully adorned with fes-
</p>
<p>toons of crape. Each wore an elegant badge of
</p>
<p>mourning. The appearance of these one hundred and
</p>
<p>thirty or forty fine looking men, the face of each wear-
</p>
<p>ing an expression of sadness, was impressive and
</p>
<p>touching. The sincerity of the demonstration was ap-
</p>
<p>parent to all. Then followed the carriage containing
</p>
<p>the crippled members of the Brotherhood. Following
</p>
<p>this were the hearse, the lovely floral wheel discernible
</p>
<p>through the rear windows, and the pall-bearers, Geo.
</p>
<p>Best, Frank Reynolds, E. Updike, A. H. Vanwormer,
</p>
<p>Geo. Stofft and G. McDowell, walking on each side of
</p>
<p>the hearse. Next were the carriages. It is estimated
</p>
<p>that the procession was a mile in length. In addition
</p>
<p>to those in the line, many sympathizing friends passed
</p>
<p>along the sidewalks on each side."
</p>
<p>"Arriving at the grave the Brotherhood formed in a
</p>
<p>circle around it and the impressive service of laving
</p>
<p>awav a brother was performed by Chief Engineer Thos.
</p>
<p>Hill, assisted by Chaplain John Saddler, after which
</p>
<p>the quartette sang a beautiful song, and the benedic-
</p>
<p>tion was pronounced by Rev. Bradshaw." '
</p>
<p>Paul Morton came out in the Associated Press
</p>
<p>dispatches, May i, and declared the strike off on the
</p>
<p>C, B. & Q. This was the third time that Paul Mor-
</p>
<p>ton had declared the strike off since the 27th of
</p>
<p>February.
</p>
<p> : Xo doubt the Burlington officials would have been
</p>
<p>glad to have it declared off, because they were being
</p>
<p>scored most unmercifully by western newspapers.

<p>THE STRIKE NOT OFF
</p>
<p>4*3
</p>
<p>The St. Joseph, Mo., Gazette, of May 7th, says, "We
</p>
<p>have a few more items of interest to present for the
</p>
<p>edification of the Burlington managers and the instruc-
</p>
<p>tion of the traveling and shipping public. The strike-
</p>
<p>is over, it is said, but somehow things do not seem to
</p>
<p>get the proper hitch in their trousers."
</p>
<p>"B. & M. engine No. 128, and K. C. engine No. 1..
</p>
<p>met on a single track a mile north of Nodaway sta-
</p>
<p>tion, thirteen miles from St. Joseph, yesterday morn-
</p>
<p>ing. The meeting was more forcible than profitable,
</p>
<p>and the locomotives will have to be almost rebuilt be-
</p>
<p>fore they will be of any special service to the com-
</p>
<p>pany."
</p>
<p>"The accident occurred in this manner: Both trains
</p>
<p>had orders to meet "and pass at Nodaway, but the K.
</p>
<p>C. engineer, a new man named Jones, forgot his orders.
</p>
<p>Conductor Harrington was not attending to business
</p>
<p>and the train ran gaily by the station and into the B.
</p>
<p>& M. train. A dozen cars, about half of which were
</p>
<p>oaded, were converted into kindling wood and the en-
</p>
<p>gines were total wrecks. They were towed into St.
</p>
<p>Joseph in the afternoon and taken to the shops. The
</p>
<p>rainmen jumped when they saw a collision was in-
</p>
<p>evitable. Some of them received severe bruises but
</p>
<p>fortunately no one, so far as can be learned, was
</p>
<p>killed. All trains were delayed three or four hours.
</p>

<p>During the first week of May occurred the Rope

<p>immense amount of money was spent by the Burling-

</p>
<p>sary, and the comments upon this wreck from the
</p>
<p>press of the west, could not have been very consoling
</p>
<p>in the face of a declaration that the strike was over
</p>
<p>and their men were competent. The St. Joseph Mo.,
</p>
<p>Gazette had an article headed " B. & M. Butcheries,"
</p>
<p>and illustrations were shown from photographs taken
</p>
<p>on the spot. Mr. Morton said all these stories of
</p>
<p>wrecks were fakes, and we give a few extracts. The
</p>
<p>Gazette says:
</p>
<p>" That the B. & M. railroad in Nebraska is in a
</p>
<p>fearful condition; that travel over it is extremely dan-
</p>
<p>gerous; that those who are compelled to buy its ser-
</p>
<p>vices take their lives in their hands there is no need
</p>
<p>denying, and not an official will seek to deny. Trav-
</p>
<p>eling men feel a sense of perfect insecurity, and
</p>
<p>breathe with more ease when at last, after numerous
</p>
<p>unwarranted and inexcusable delays, their destination
</p>
<p>is reached. Dead engines, wrecked freight cars,
</p>
<p>damaged coaches, splintered sleepers, and generally
</p>
<p>demoralized rolling stock fill half the sidings and all
</p>
<p>the repair shops along the line. Wreck after wreck
</p>
<p>has been reported, all coupled with loss of life, maim-
</p>
<p>ing of limbs, and injuries to a greater or less extent.
</p>
<p>Trains meet on the iron highway, at all hours, day
</p>
<p>and night, and often fatal accidents are only averted
</p>
<p>by the interposition of providence on behalf of those
</p>
<p>who are compelled to travel over the B. & M., and
</p>
<p>therefore are not responsible. The once famous ' cannon
</p>
<p>ball ' is a cannon ball no longer, except that acting in
</p>
<p>the capacity of a loaded van it is armed, thanks to in-
</p>
<p>competent men with double the death-dealing qualities

<p>of the missle from which it takes its name. It would
</p>
<p>THE STRIKE NOT OFF. 415
</p>
<p>be a greater means of destruction but for the fact that
</p>
<p>its passengers are to and from local points only.
</p>
<p>Through passengers are an unknown quantity. In spite
</p>
<p>of the vigorous and earnest, would they were honest,
</p>
<p>protests of managers, superintendents, passenger
</p>
<p>agents, and hired organs, all, or nearly all of the once
</p>
<p>handsome through business enjoyed by the road has
</p>
<p>gone; vanished like the tramp's dream of wealth; and
</p>
<p>it will not soon be regained. Imagine the famous B.
</p>
<p>& M., the once great through route to Denver, run-
</p>
<p>ning solid day and night trains of never less than three
</p>
<p>cars each for the accommodation of never more than
</p>
<p>twenty passengers. No. 40 has made the run from
</p>
<p>Denver to St. Joseph within the last week, carrying
</p>
<p>but eight passengers, and No. 39 has done the same
</p>
<p>thing. Day coaches and smokers are well nigh de-
</p>
<p>serted and the few passengers ride in the sleepers, be-
</p>
<p>cause in ca?e of one of the many accidents they may
</p>
<p>be enabled to at least escape with their lives."
</p>
<p>"In sustaining this position the management has at-
</p>
<p>tempted to belittle any and all reports of wrecks, and
</p>
<p>this refers not only to the B. & M., but to all parts of
</p>
<p>the Burlington system. Hired organs, instead of
</p>
<p>sending representatives to scenes of accidents, have
</p>
<p>rushed them into the company's headquarters that an
</p>
<p>' official report ' might be secured ! Damages amount-
</p>
<p>ing to thousands of dollars have been scaled down to
</p>
<p>hundreds; collisions have been averted by passengers
</p>
<p>and road men, and the incompetents now manning
</p>
<p>engines, have been excused on the plea that they do
</p>
<p>not know the road. The only thing that has prevent-

</p>
<p>has been light and traffic has been diverted to other
</p>
<p>lines. The wrecks which have occurred are seventy
</p>
<p>per cent greater in number, since February 26, and
</p>
<p>200 per cent greater in loss of life and property than
</p>
<p>ever occurred on the Burlington system in the same
</p>
<p>period before. And thev are multiplying, not decreas-
</p>
<p>ing. A case in point is the recent wreck at Alma,
</p>
<p>Neb. In violation of orders the trainmen rushed on
</p>
<p>a rotten culvert at a tremendous rate of speed, and
</p>
<p>in an instant five souls had been sent into eternitv.
</p>
<p>Two bodies were found two days after the accident,
</p>
<p>and two are known to be missing. Officials at once
</p>
<p>began to lie about the cause and fatalities, and every ef-
</p>
<p>fort was made to cover the matter, that the already poor
</p>
<p>traffic might not be entirely lost. The Nebraska press
</p>
<p>was flooded with padded and untruthful accounts of the
</p>
<p>efforts of the officials to care for the wounded and find
</p>
<p>the dead. They did little or nothing: chieflv the lat-
</p>
<p>ter; and when the coroner's juries had taken testimo-
</p>
<p>ny every effort was made to belittle and suppress it."
</p>
<p>" Then the company telegraphed it broadcast that

<p>every effort had been make bv it to recover the miss-

<p>ing bodies."
</p>
<p>" Not only is every statement that the B. & M.
</p>
<p>officials or employes either assisted in the search for
</p>
<p>bodies or took any care of them when found, most
</p>
<p>maliciously false, but exactly the opposite is true, as
</p>
<p>can be established by the testimony of hundreds of the

<p>company has been censured by two juries.'"
</p>
<p>" Not only has the negligence of the company and
</p>
<p>its employes, in allowing the wreck to occur, been fully
</p>
<p>established, but their utter neglect and refusal to
</p>
<p>search for bodies is known to all people. Sheriff Al-

<p>len and the people of Alma are entitled to the credit
</p>
<p>for finding these missing bodies, as they have never

<p>for a moment relaxed their vigilance in the matter, and

<p>the B. & M. is entitled to nothing."

<p>found when the employes and the hirelings of the B.

<p>disaster, and knowing that the first coroner's jury had

<p>found them guilty of criminal negligence, none of
</p>
<p>them ever lifted a hand to search for the bodies of the

<p>were quite anxious, so long as they could not cover up

<p>the evidences of their negligence and brutality, to
</p>
<p>swear away the honest testimony that, by revealing
</p>
<p>the facts, would damage their testimony. It was not
</p>
<p>because the company cared a straw for the dead and
</p>
<p>wounded or their sorrowing relatives, but because
</p>
<p>they hoped to evade the payment of just and reason-
</p>
<p>able damages. The conductor swore to receiving

<p>that sometimes the managers of American corporations
</p>
<p>have but one maxim : ' Might makes right '  -a brutal
</p>
<p>maxim, the utterance of rapacity,  an echo from the
</p>
<p>depths of human selfishness. A maxim embodying
</p>
<p>a menace to the weak, its very word is freighted with
</p>
<p>malevolence."
</p>
<p>" But if it be true that corporations are conscience-
</p>
<p>less, it is also true that stockholders have pockets, and
</p>
<p>that while all other appeals may fail, an argument
</p>
<p>which addresses itself to the instincts of Boston shop-
</p>
<p>keepers and money changers is very apt to receive
</p>
<p>most careful consideration. Under existing conditions
</p>
<p>little improvement in the business ot the C, B. & Q.
</p>
<p>can be expected. Travelers will not submit their
</p>
<p>lives to unnecessary dangers. Shippers will prefer
</p>
<p>roads unembarassed by the complications which now
</p>
<p>render the train service of the C, B. & Q. roads en-
</p>
<p>tirely unsatisfactory as well as unsafe. By common
</p>
<p>consent the C, B. & Q. system has been boycotted,
</p>
<p>not altogether because of its injustice to its employes,
</p>
<p>but because of its inability to discharge the duties of a
</p>
<p>common carrier. Public confidence can only be re-
</p>
<p>stored by manning its trains with sober and competent
</p>
<p>men. The pretense so volubly put forth that < the
</p>
<p>strike is over,' that ' all trains are running on time,'
</p>
<p>that ' the Q. has its full complement of engineers and
</p>
<p>firemen,' etc., etc., has deceived nobody. The acci-
</p>
<p>dents and calamities occurring on all parts of the sys-
</p>
<p>tem tell another story. The plain and apparent fact
</p>
<p>is, that notwithstanding the great reduction in the vol-

<p>that under existing circumstances it could not handle
</p>
<p>the enormous traffic it formerly enjoyed, even were
</p>
<p>public confidence restored. It has raked the slums of
</p>
<p>the nation for substitutes for the striking engineers.
</p>
<p>The lame, the halt and the blind have been drafted in-
</p>
<p>to its service. Drunkards, convicts, men who before
</p>
<p>the strike would never have even dreamed of applving
</p>
<p>to it for employment now have charge of its engines,
</p>
<p>and to their doubtful keeping are committed the
</p>
<p>lives and property of its patrons. To say that many,
</p>
<p>or even amajoritv of its engineers, are competent, is no
</p>
<p>answer to this charge. It is enough to know that many
</p>
<p>of them are incompetent, and of this abundant proof
</p>
<p>is not wanting. With all possible safeguards against
</p>
<p>accidents, travel bv rail is sufficiently hazardous, and
</p>
<p>the road which willfully omits the least of these safe-
</p>
<p>guards is undeserving of public patronage. The con-
</p>
<p>duct of the C, B. & Q road in taking into its employ-
</p>
<p>ment the class of men now running its engines was an
</p>
<p>act of criminal desperation. Its stubborn refusal to
</p>
<p>recognize as anything better than serfs, men who had
</p>
<p>served it faithfully for so many years, was a brutal ex-
</p>
<p>hibition of arrogance, and its subsequent indifference
</p>
<p>to the rights of the public and the safety of life and
</p>
<p>property, a crime."
</p>

<p>similar ones which are sure to follow will probably do

<p>committeemen of the Burlington, look over the situa-
</p>
<p>tion and make some provisions for future action. If
</p>
<p>was thought by many that at the meeting of the
</p>
<p>stockholders, the immense losses already sustained,
</p>
<p>and the depreciation of the stock, would induce the
</p>
<p>directors to modify their position and be willing to
</p>
<p>arbitrate and get the strike declared off. But the
</p>
<p>Forbes interests were there with proxies sufficient to
</p>
<p>bar out any effort to change their policy, and they
</p>
<p>voted confidence in President Perkins and the official
</p>
<p>management of the strike. This convinced Grand
</p>
<p>Chief Arthur and Grand Master Sargent that further
</p>
<p>effort to effect any settlement was useless, and con-
</p>
<p>cluded to advise the committee there assembled to
</p>
<p>declare the strike off  Grand Chief Arthur coming
</p>
<p>from Cleveland for that purpose. But the committee
</p>
<p>voted unanimously to continue the strike, and a vote
</p>
<p>was taken along the line and forwarded to the two
</p>
<p>chairmen, Hoge and Murphy. The vote stood 155S
</p>
<p>to continue the strike and nineteen to declare it off.
</p>
<p>So the grand officers went to their respective head-
</p>
<p>quarters as there was nothing to their mind they
</p>
<p>could do but see that the men were supported finan-
</p>
<p>cially. The strike was as vigorously prosecuted as it
</p>
<p>was in the power of the Burlington strikers. Speak-
</p>
<p>ers were sent over the country, the interest kept in a

<p>lively state, and the Brotherhood men and Knights

<p>of Labor vied with each other in diverting business

<p>"Dear Sir: I wish to see you regarding the

</p>
<p>Mr. George R. Dunne:
</p>
<p>" Dear Sir: So far as I know, the sympathies of
</p>
<p>the public teachers are with the Brotherhood and de-
</p>
<p>cidedly against the C, B. & Q. So long as there are
</p>
<p>other routes of travel we shall never board a Q. pas-

</p>
<p>During the month of June laboring people through-
</p>
<p>out the west were keeping an eye on all patrons of

<p>424 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>to patronize the Burlington and no doubt it had a
</p>
<p>powerful influence. Immense meetings were held,
</p>
<p>and the road was placed before the public by speak-
</p>
<p>ers in a manner that must have been anything but
</p>
<p>pleasant for the managers. On June 11, an immense
</p>
<p>meeting was held at Lincoln, Nebraska. We give a
</p>
<p>few extracts from the speeches, as they have a direct
</p>
<p>bearing upon the subject before us, as showing the
</p>
<p>magnitude of the power with which the Brother-
</p>
<p>hoods were contending. Hon. Ex-Governor But-
</p>
<p>ler said:
</p>
<p>"Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:  I must
</p>
<p>say that I am somewhat disappointed from the fact I had
</p>
<p>no expectation of meeting so large an audience as I
</p>
<p>find here to-night, and if I fail to come up to 3-our ex-
</p>
<p>pectations, why, be a little charitable."
</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, I am here to-night to talk for a few
</p>
<p>moments on the question of labor which governs the
</p>
<p>people from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the
</p>
<p>lakes to the gulf. This question is not confined to this
</p>
<p>continent. Go into any of the states of Europe and
</p>
<p>you will find the same question being agitated there. "
</p>
<p>"There never has been on earth, never, no living
</p>
<p>man that ever honestly accumulated five millions of dol-
</p>
<p>lars; he never did that on earth; there never was such
</p>
<p>a thing; he doesn't need it in the first place, he can't
</p>
<p>use it, he can't appreciate it, and he never made it hon-
</p>
<p>estly  there never was such a thing on earth.*'
</p>
<p>As an illustration he said: "Suppose that Adam
</p>
<p>had laid up a dollar a day from the day of his birth to
</p>
<p>the present time, how much do you suppose he would

</p>
<p>not have made Vanderbilt a vest, would it? There he
</p>
<p>had worked five thousand years. We had a class of
</p>
<p>scientists sometime since that claimed they had discov-
</p>
<p>ered a pre-historic man; thev went on to say that he
</p>
<p>had lived live hundred thousand years before Adam;
</p>
<p>suppose they had found this man to be five hundred
</p>
<p>thousand years older than Adam, suppose he had been
</p>
<p>a Knight of Labor and had worked from that day to
</p>
<p>the present, every day, Sunday not excepted, no
</p>
<p>rainy day excepted, how much do you suppose that
</p>
<p>gentleman would have had? He would have made
</p>
<p>$182,000,000. Vanderbilt could have bought him
</p>
<p>out and had $43,000,000 to put into Lincoln street
</p>
<p>railway stock. (Laughter) How did Vanderbilt ac-
</p>
<p>cumulate that vast wealth? He accumulated it bv
</p>
<p>regulating- commerce among the states. Don't you
</p>
<p>remember of reading of parties in the medieval ages
</p>
<p>taking refuge in the mountains and forming themselves
</p>
<p>into bands and tribes, and when people would be pass-
</p>
<p>ing over the King's highway, these thieves would
</p>
<p>come out and rob the people and take all they had;
</p>
<p>thev said they took what the traffic would bear; that
</p>
<p>is what Vanderbilt and his associates have been doing;
</p>
<p>they have taken the place of congress and stood on
</p>
<p>the King's highway and robbed the people from here
</p>
<p>to New York, and from New York to the old coun-
</p>
<p>try. How shall we remedy this? Some will say, 'You
</p>
<p>can't doit.' 'Can't?' Is that possible? I think from the
</p>
<p>looks of the faces here to-night that a number of these
</p>
<p>wrongs could be rectified and I think they will be.

<p>chose: and in this struggle to-day England has an ex-
</p>
<p>act parallel in this country, and that is the C, B. & Q.
</p>
<p>railway corporation. [Applause.] There was a party
</p>
<p>of the second part. They were the patriots of the
</p>
<p>American colonies. They were the men who said, we
</p>
<p>will resist this tyranny. They were the men who
</p>
<p>said, you can rob us to a certain extent, but you cannot
</p>
<p>trample upon our manhood. They were the men who
</p>
<p>demanded justice. They were the men who said, we
</p>
<p>will resist until death, and said they were willing to
</p>
<p>die that the cause of liberty should live. They were
</p>
<p>the men who were made out of the same stuff that
</p>
<p>Patrick Henry was, who said: 'Give -me liberty or
</p>
<p>give me death,' and that party has an exact parallel in
</p>
<p>this struggle to-dav, and it is the C, B. & Q. strikers.
</p>
<p>And there was another party  a party of the third
</p>
<p>part  and they were called the tories. They were
</p>
<p>men who were born and bred upon the American soil.
</p>
<p>Thev were the men who were raised under the same
</p>
<p>influence that gave birth to freedom. They were the
</p>
<p>men who were raised by the side of these same patriots
</p>
<p>that went out to fight fearlessly for liberty, and yet
</p>
<p>these men raised under these influences turned against
</p>
<p>the country. They said, we will defend tyranny. We
</p>
<p>will arise in the defense of slavery. We will stamp
</p>
<p>down the spirit of liberty. We will destroy all good
</p>
<p>and noble principles, while such men as John Adams

<p>oui sacred honors,' and that party to-day has an exact

</p>
<p>parallel in the struggle, and these are the scabs." '
</p>
<p>This is only a sample of what was being done in all
</p>
<p>directions; the. sympathy engendered by these meet-
</p>
<p>ings and the incompetency of the men employed by the
</p>
<p>Burlington produced in a great measure the following-
</p>
<p>result :
</p>
<p>The gross earnings for June show a decrease of
</p>
<p>only $186,899 compared with the previous year, but
</p>
<p>the operating expenses increased $320,047, which
</p>
<p>brings the total net decrease for the month up to one
</p>
<p>half a million dollars. The decrease in net earnings
</p>
<p>from Jan. 1 to July 1 amounts to nearly $5,000,000.
</p>
<p>With this report, it would seem unnecessary to men-
</p>
<p>tion any wrecks; it contains all the evidence necessary
</p>
<p>as to the Burlington's condition.
</p>
<p>On the 5th of July was sprung the Pinkerton de-
</p>
<p>tective sensation, astonishing the public, and aston-
</p>
<p>ishing the two Brotherhoods fully as much. The
</p>
<p>two chairmen of the grievance committee were ar-
</p>
<p>rested; but it did not create a stampede among the
</p>
<p>strikers, a result that was very much desired and ex-
</p>
<p>pected. Violence was contrary to their habits and
</p>
<p>their principles. They refused to believe that any of
</p>
<p>their number were guilty, and they kept on their way
</p>
<p>as though it had not happened. On the 10th the
</p>
<p>Burlington reduced their force of switchmen at Kan-
</p>
<p>sas City, -Mo. The switchmen claimed that the com-
</p>
<p>pany agreed to keep them all at work, if they would
</p>
<p>stay when the engineers and firemen struck until the
</p>
<p>strike was declared off. Six of them were discharged

<p>with these, again put the boycott on the Burlington.
</p>
<p>The officials of all the roads were convened in
</p>
<p>Kansas City, but by the advice of the grand master
</p>
<p>of their order, Mr. Monoghan, the strike was declared
</p>
<p>off. and scab switchmen were employed in their
</p>
<p>places.
</p>
<p>At the suggestion of a Wabash official, two engi-
</p>
<p>neers of that road waited upon Mr. Stone, in an effort
</p>
<p>to get a settlement, and secured an interview, and by
</p>
<p>common consent a meeting was agreed upon when
</p>
<p>Messrs. Arthur and Sargent could be present. On
</p>
<p>July 14 these gentlemen were requested by the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood's legal advisor, Mr. Sullivan, to come to Chicago
</p>
<p>on the 16th. The meeting was appointed for that day
</p>
<p>at 2 o'clock p. m. The leading officials and their
</p>
<p>attorneys of both sides, were present. Mr. Perkins
</p>
<p>wanted the strike declared off, but the inducements
</p>
<p>were not very great. After a long conference, the
</p>
<p>following propositions were made:
</p>
<p>1st. Mr. Perkins would take back such of the men
</p>
<p>as he wanted to fill the positions then vacant, and as he
</p>
<p>needed more engineers and firemen he would give the
</p>
<p>old men the preference, rather than hire men coming
</p>
<p>from other roads
</p>
<p>2nd. That the order issued by General Superin-
</p>
<p>tendent Besler  that the switchmen could never
</p>
<p>work for the Burlington again, or to that effect  be

<p>rescinded, and they would be treated the same as the
</p>
<p>engineers and firemen."

</p>
<p>engaging in the strike.
</p>
<p>These propositions had to be submitted to the men,
</p>
<p>for they had voted the strike on, and must vote it off,
</p>
<p>two grand officers having no power to decide the
</p>
<p>matter. With the approval of Messrs. Arthur and
</p>
<p>Sargent, the two chairmen Hoge and Murphy, were
</p>
<p>ed to go over the line, explain the situation and
</p>
<p>ask the men not to allow pride, or sentiment to pre-
</p>
<p>vent them from taking the course which the two
</p>
<p>nd officers were convinced was the wise one.
</p>
<p>was an unpleasant duty to perform, the
</p>
<p>ler can judge by the vote which stood 742
</p>
<p>inst, to 9 in favor. While the two chairmen were
</p>
<p>d in taking the vote, a joint meeting of the
</p>
<p>ingineers, firemen, switchmen and brake-
</p>
<p>>n vened at Tootles Opera House, St. Joseph,

</p>
<p>About seven hundred delegates were present,
</p>
<p>representing lodges of the United States, Canada, and
</p>
<p>Mexico. Great care was taken to keep the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings as quiet as possible. Mr. Frank P. McDonald,
</p>
<p>chairman of the grievance committee of the local
</p>
<p>therhood, called the meeting to order. A commit-
</p>
<p>tee was appointed to search the opera house for spies,
</p>
<p>with a lantern. Finally a pair of shoes was found
</p>
<p>on the stairway leading up into the attic, above the
</p>
<p>celling of the gallery. This excited suspicion, and the
</p>
<p>stage-carpenter, whose name is Moore, was asked
</p>
<p>about the shoes. He said that they belonged to him,
</p>
<p>and when asked to describe them made a mistake. A

</p>
<p>found secreted in the chandelier supports, without
</p>
<p>clothes on except a honey-comb undershirt and a pair
</p>
<p>of overalls. His name was David Replogel, a short-
</p>
<p>hand writer in the employ of Lancaster, Thomas &
</p>
<p>Dawes, attorneys, at 318 Francis court."
</p>
<p>"Replogel was found by a member of the local
</p>
<p>Brakemen's Brotherhood. He was escorted down the
</p>
<p>ladder amid the yells of the Brotherhood members,
</p>
<p>who believed that Replogel was a Pinkerton employe.
</p>
<p>Replogel stated that he had been hired by Jake W.
</p>
<p>Spencer, formerly publisher of the Evening News, but
</p>
<p>now proprietor of the Journal of Commerce, to take the
</p>
<p>proceedings of the convention in short hand for his
</p>
<p>paper. He said that he was to be paid $25 for the
</p>
<p>work, and admitted that the stage carpenter had
</p>
<p>shown him the hiding place. A large crowd gathered
</p>
<p>around him when he was brought down on the stage,
</p>
<p>and but for the interference of cooler heads, Replogel
</p>
<p>would have been roughly handled."
</p>
<p>" He had taken lunch and a bottle of water up to
</p>
<p>his hiding place and was prepared to remain there all
</p>
<p>clay."
</p>
<p>"He was marched to police headquarters through
</p>
<p>the streets in his bare feet, undershirt and overalls;
</p>
<p>bare headed, and looked more like a chimney sweep
</p>
<p>than a stenographer."
</p>
<p>" Great excitement prevailed while Replogel was
</p>
<p>being taken from the opera house, and cries of ' Pink-
</p>

</p>
<p>Scott & Gulf road. M. W. Sullivan, Charles Porter'
</p>
<p>and R. Morris, all of St Joe, Were elected secretaries.',
</p>
<p>This meeting tended greatly towards harmonizing
</p>
<p>the various interests of railroad employes, it being com-
</p>
<p>posed of engineers, firemen, switchmen, and brakemen.
</p>
<p>It was agreed that federation was in the interest of all,
</p>
<p>and that each order should, at its coming convention,
</p>
<p>pass such laws as were necessary to put it in practical
</p>
<p>operation. This meeting heartily approved the action
</p>
<p>taken by the Burlington strikers, in refusing to accept the
</p>
<p>terms offered by that company and declare the strike off.
</p>
<p>"Inasmuch as it was at Stone's request that the
</p>
<p>chairmen of the Q. grievance committee took their
</p>
<p>unnecessary trip over the system, they felt that it
</p>
<p>was incumbent upon them, as a matter of courtesy, to
</p>
<p>wait on Mr. Stone upon their return and announce
</p>
<p>the result of their pacific mission."
</p>
<p>"Mr. Stone received them pleasantry, but without
</p>
<p>any overwhelming demonstration of warmth. When
</p>
<p>told that the men had rejected the proposition, Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone only said that he was sorry, and that he thought
</p>
<p>they had made a mistake." 1
</p>
<p>It was anticipated by the delegates comprising the

<p>opened to the four orders above mentioned, and that
</p>
<p>the federation should be further discussed. But that
</p>
<p>meeting was very exclusive, none but grievance com-
</p>
<p>mitteemen being admitted. Mr Arthur stated at this
</p>
<p>meeting that he would not object to federation  each
</p>
<p>order retaining its individuality  with a board com-
</p>
<p>posed of members of all the orders to which problems
</p>
<p>should be submitted which the separate orders had
</p>
<p>been unable to solve. The St. Louis meeting was
</p>
<p>decidedly unproductive, and it clearly proved that con-
</p>
<p>servatism was daily becoming stronger.
</p>
<p>' At the convention of the firemen, held at Atlanta,
</p>
<p>Ga., a federation law was passed, and a committee was
</p>
<p>appointed to present it to the switchmen's convention
</p>
<p>then being held in St. Louis. That bodv approved of
</p>
<p>a modified form, and the brakemen's convention fol-
</p>
<p>lowed without taking decided action, but left their
</p>
<p>doors open for future decision. The engineers' con-
</p>
<p>vention followed, at Richmond, Va., when it was
</p>
<p>thought the engineers would surely fall in line, and pass
</p>
<p>some law on federation. But the earnest believers in
</p>
<p>the benefits of such a law, were doomed to disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment. Mr. Arthur, from some cause, had changed
</p>
<p>his mind, and the plan was defeated by a small ma-
</p>
<p>jority. At this convention a resolution was carried, that
</p>
<p>a committee of men be appointed to settle the strike
</p>
<p>on the Burlington and declare it off, and the Grand
</p>
<p>Chief appointed A. R. Cavner, S. G. A. E., of Cali-

</p>
<p>DYNAMITE.
</p>
<p>The Associated Press of July 5, heralded the great
</p>
<p>sensational arrest of " Thomas Broderick and James
</p>
<p>Bowles, members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
</p>
<p>Engineers, and another man named Wilson, on a Chi-
</p>
<p>cago, Burlington & Quincy train this afternoon,
</p>
<p>brought to Chicago, and locked in the county jail,
</p>
<p>under bonds of $5,000 each, charged with conspiring
</p>
<p>to destroy the railroad company's property. They
</p>
<p>had a considerable quantity of dynamite in their pos-
</p>
<p>session when arrested."
</p>
<p>" It is stated that the Burlington company has had a
</p>
<p>large force of detectives engaged for a long time in
</p>
<p>watching the movements of the strikers. Several so-
</p>
<p>called ' agitators,' whose movements corresponded
</p>
<p>with some of the past attempts upon the company's
</p>
<p>property, were put under special surveillance. ' It was
</p>
<p>discovered that dynamite was used in several unsuc-
</p>
<p>cessful attempts to wreck trains within the past few
</p>
<p>months. The principal suspects were not allowed to
</p>
<p>make a move, day or night, without being under the
</p>
<p>watchful eye of the officers. It was impossible at first
</p>
<p>to locate the dynamite, but the officials of the 'Q.' as-
</p>
<p>sert to-night that positive information was finally re-
</p>
<p>ceived to-day that this was the day chosen for a grand
</p>
<p>attack upon the company's property. The officials are

<p>but the plot is known to them, and they admit that be-
</p>
<p>sides a definite plan to blow up trains upon the tracks by
</p>
<p>means of dynamite cartridges, that it included the pos-
</p>
<p>sibility of an attack upon the depot property and mag-
</p>
<p>nificent office buildings here."
</p>
<p>" The officials say that if the danger had not been
</p>
<p>so imminent they would have allowed the conspirators
</p>
<p>to go on and further criminate themselves, but the
</p>
<p>plot had reached a stage where it was necessary to
</p>
<p>take decisive steps to prevent great destruction of
</p>
<p>property, not to say loss of human life."
</p>
<p>"Superintendent of Motive Power, G. W. Rhodes,
</p>
<p>swore out a warrant to-dav, and deputy Marshal Bur-
</p>
<p>chard proceeded with it to Aurora, in company with
</p>
<p>detectives. Their men were located and shadowed to
</p>
<p>the 2:1c; afternoon train for Chicago. Thomas Brod-
</p>
<p>erick and James Bowles, two ex-Brotherhood engineers
</p>
<p>of the ' Q.,' were seen to board the train in company
</p>
<p>with a man not known to the officers. A fourth man
</p>
<p>they were looking for was not identified. The strange
</p>
<p>man. who proved to be John Q. Wilson, took a. double
</p>
<p>seat beside Broderick, while Bowles sat just across the
</p>
<p>aisle. The train had barely started when the officers
</p>
<p>tapped the men on the shoulders and made them
</p>
<p>prisoners. The men had taken off their coats and
</p>
<p>under the two coats lying between Broderick and
</p>
<p>Wilson upon the seat was an innocent looking pack-
</p>
<p>age wrapped in a newspaper. When he had captured

</p>
<p>ed as he realized the possible danger of its contents.

</p>
<p>" McGinty sprang to the bell rope and stopped the
</p>
<p>train. Running back along the track he found the
</p>
<p>letter. It is now in the possession of District Attorney
</p>
<p>Ewing. He refuses to reveal its contents, but Gener-
</p>
<p>al Manager Stone intimated that its contents gave im-
</p>
<p>portant information regarding the plot."
</p>
<p>" The officers reached the city with their prisoner
</p>
<p>without incident. Broderick and Wilson being stoically
</p>
<p>indifferent to everything, while Bowles was profuse in
</p>
<p>his explanations of ' mistakes.' "
</p>
<p>" A valise was taken from Bowles and several let-
</p>
<p>ters and papers. These were taken to the district at-
</p>
<p>torney's office with the newspaper package, and
</p>
<p>was then, for the first time, examined and found to
</p>
<p>contain four dynamite cartridges, each about ten inches
</p>
<p>long, and an inch and a quarter square. These were
</p>
<p>fitted with a small fuse to each, and Mr. Rhodes estimat-
</p>
<p>ed that they each contained about a pound of dyna-
</p>
<p>mite. In Broderick's pocket in a purse, were found
</p>
<p>several small dynamite fulminating caps."
</p>
<p>" The prisoners were taken before United States
</p>
<p>Commissioner Hoyne on their arrival here. Bowles
</p>
<p>asked for Chairman Hoge, of the old Burlington
</p>
<p>grievance committee, and also for Attorney Sullivan.
</p>
<p>These gentlemen were sent for and while waiting
</p>
<p>Bowles talked quite freely. He claimed that he knew
</p>
<p>nothing about the dynamite, He worked on the Atch-
</p>

</p>
<p>days ago, as he says, to brace the strikers up as they

<p>were becoming weak, but he claims he never counseled

</p>
<p>" When Chairman Hoge, learned the full gravity of

</p>
<p>The district attorney arrainged the defendants under

</p>
<p>" ' I cannot get you any bail to-night,' said Hoge

<p>coldly to Bowles in response to the latter's fervent
</p>
<p>appeal to be kept out of jail. Then he promised that

<p>an attorney would be secured at once and that an
</p>
<p>effort would be made to get them bail to-morrow.
</p>
<p>All of the men denied positively that they knew any-

<p>thing about the dynamite and disclaimed ownership of

</p>
<p>" General Manager Stone was seen by a reporter,

<p>and told substantially the same story as related above.
</p>
<p>He would not say anything more to-night regarding
</p>

<p>the Brotherhood are connected with the conspiracy to

<p>use dynamite." '
</p>
<p>The Brotherhoods were as much astonished, if not
</p>
<p>more than the public. The strikers did not believe it,
</p>
<p>and voted in the face of it, to continue the strike, be-
</p>
<p>lieving it was the work of the Pinkerton agency.

</p>
<p>DYNAMITE. 439
</p>
<p>The Pinkerton men had been strung over the length
</p>
<p>of the Burlington system, and it was in their interest
</p>
<p>to show the proficiency of that force by some startling
</p>
<p>developments. They had used up an immense amount
</p>
<p>of money without being practically useful. They
</p>
<p>must redeem their calling. The men also believed
</p>
<p>the Burlington would use whatever clue was given
</p>
<p>them, and use it to its utmost, and there was nothing
</p>
<p>in the after developments that changed that belief.
</p>
<p>Following July 5, came in quick succession, the arrests
</p>
<p>of J. A. Bauereisen, chief engineer of Div. 32,
</p>
<p>George Goding a member of both engineers and
</p>
<p>firemen's order, Alexander Smith of the firemen's order,
</p>
<p>and A. Koegal of the engineers, at Aurora. Then
</p>
<p>came the arrest of the two chairmen, Hoge and Mur-
</p>
<p>phy, on a charge of conspiracy, at Chicago. Then
</p>
<p>followed the arrest of George Clark and George D.
</p>
<p>Meiley, of Galesburg. A joint indictment being made
</p>
<p>against J. A. Bauereisen in each case until there were
</p>
<p>16 charges, requiring $37,500 bail, all of which was
</p>
<p>immediately furnished. If this was not for persecu-
</p>
<p>tion, the indications were very deceiving. All along
</p>
<p>the line was heralded the finding of dynamite, in an
</p>
<p>apparent effort to fasten disgrace upon the Brother-
</p>
<p>hoods. These stories may have originated wholly in
</p>
<p>the fervid brain of the reporter, but the public found
</p>
<p>the following food for mental bias in the newspapers:

</p>
<p>by striking engineers. The dynamite, it is asserted,
</p>
<p>has been located, and the parties in possession of it
</p>
<p>are under detective surveillance, and will be arrested
</p>
<p>when sufficient evidence is secured. The officers also
</p>
<p>claim that dynamite was shipped to Plattsmouth and
</p>
<p>Rulo for a similiar purpose. Startling developments
</p>
<p>are looked for." '
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to say that these startling devel-
</p>
<p>opments never materalized, but on the other hand
</p>
<p>it produced what every aggressive move that is
</p>
<p>pushed to extremes by capital always does  solidified
</p>
<p>the very element the aggression is intended to dis-
</p>
<p>rupt. The following extracts from the master work-
</p>
<p>man of Nebraska, is significent of this fact. He says,
</p>
<p>" I have not forgotten the sufferings of many of our
</p>
<p>own brethren at the hands of these Pinkerton free-
</p>
<p>booters. I distinctly remember, and it is within the
</p>
<p>recollection of other members of a few years ago,
</p>
<p>when a prominent Knight of Labor of Michigan was
</p>
<p>arrested and imprisoned by this same gang of mercen-
</p>
<p>aries. He was arrested without cause. He was
</p>
<p>plunged into a dungeon. He was a man of clean pri-
</p>
<p>vate life and honest public record. But so skillful was
</p>
<p>the conspirator's net that the Pinkertons had woven
</p>
<p>about him  so clearly did the crime that was their do-
</p>
<p>ing, cling to him, that it seemed impossible to prove
</p>
<p>his innocence. Guiltless he was, but it cost the
</p>
<p>Knights of Labor $15,000 to successfully carry his
</p>
<p>case through the courts. These same miscreants
</p>
<p>under the guise of decency, have become members of
</p>
<p>the Knights of Labor Assemblies, and of the engi-
</p>
<p>neers, have organized conspiracies, have procured the

<p>arrest of Knights without cause."
</p>
<p>"In the city of Beatrice there are about 700 Knights
</p>
<p>of Labor in good and bad standing. Of other labor
</p>
<p>organizations there is membership enough to swell
</p>
<p>the number beyond 1,000. Suppose this number of
</p>
<p>men should absolutely refuse to buy a penny's worth
</p>
<p>of goods thai was shipped over the Burlington road.
</p>
<p>Suppose that they should, as one man, boycott the
</p>
<p>merchant who ships his goods over the Burlington
</p>
<p>road! How long would that merchant be able to
</p>
<p>sustain himself in business? Indeed, how many weeks
</p>
<p>would it be before not a pound of freight arrived or
</p>
<p>departed from the B. & M. depot of Beatrice? Re-
</p>
<p>member in this connection that these 1,000 men stand-
</p>
<p>ing together, would have an influence that would lead
</p>
<p>more than double their number, or six times their
</p>
<p>number to boycott the road and the men who dared
</p>
<p>patronize it. This shows the power and resources of
</p>
<p>organized labor, and monopoly understands its capac-
</p>
<p>itv far better than do its members. No directions are
</p>
<p>necessary; every brother will understand for himself his
</p>
<p>duties in these premises.
</p>
<p>"If the Brotherhoods fail, it makes doubly certain that
</p>
<p>we shall follow in their footsteps in w r hatever struggles
</p>
<p>of our own we may have. In a word, the hopes of
</p>
<p>corporations are in the disorganization of labor.
</p>
<p>Their wealth, and skill, and secret detective work, are
</p>
<p>all directed to that end. Knights of Labor ought to
</p>
<p>have sufficient experience from the past; and should
</p>
<p>need no warning. N. D. Hubbard.

<p>ism was ever present. On the statement of John
</p>
<p>Kelley, charging them with conspiracy, Messrs. S. E.
</p>
<p>Hoge, chairman of the general grievance committee
</p>
<p>of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, and J.
</p>
<p>H. Murphy, chairman of the firemen's committee,
</p>
<p>were arrested by Inspector Bonfield, of the Chicago
</p>
<p>Detective force, on warrants sworn out by General
</p>
<p>Manager Stone, of the Burlington.
</p>
<p>The names of John J. Kelley and John H. McGillvary
</p>
<p>were also on this list for arrest, both clerks for Hoge
</p>
<p>and Murphy. Messrs. Hoge and Murphy were taken
</p>
<p>to the police court and placed in separate cells. Frank
</p>
<p>Collier, attorney for the Burlington was there, and so
</p>
<p>was Inspector Bonfield. A moment later Alexander
</p>
<p>Sullivan entered, he being Hoge and Murphy's attor-
</p>
<p>ney and advisor in civil cases.
</p>
<p>" < This case,' said Mr. Collier, ' grows out of the
</p>
<p>circular sent out to the Brotherhood lodges asking that
</p>
<p>Brotheroood men be sent on to take places on the 'Q,'
</p>
<p>and suggesting that they bring a good supply of sal
</p>
<p>soda and emery with them. The sending of these
</p>
<p>circulars is deemed prima facie evidence of a share in
</p>
<p>a concerted conspiracy, and we have a sure case
</p>
<p>against the prisoners."
</p>
<p>" We are going to show enough to prove a clear
</p>
<p>case against them  a sure case. If you want to know
</p>
<p>anything more, ask Bonfield. He has had charge of
</p>
<p>the case all the time."

<p>Ex-Judge Barnum was retained in the criminal case.
</p>
<p>Hoge and Murphy were arrested in the morning, and
</p>

<p>arrested in the afternoon. When arrested they sent
</p>
<p>DYNAMITE. 443
</p>
<p>for me and I went to see them at the armory." !
</p>
<p>Then follows what appears to be an astonishing revel-
</p>
<p>ation.
</p>
<p>" Where are these men now ? "
</p>
<p>" They are not in jail, but have gone into voluntary
</p>
<p>retirement, answered the inspector. "
</p>
<p>Inspector Bonfield gave to the public the idea that
</p>
<p>he knew nothing of Kelley prior to this arrest, but the
</p>
<p>evidence is conclusive that Kelley had furnished infor-
</p>
<p>mation to the detective agency, " and acknowledges
</p>
<p>in court that he had received pay from a friend while
</p>
<p>he was in the employ of Chairman Hoge,"* and
</p>
<p>there is no doubt that the arrest of the two chairmen
</p>
<p>was made on the statement of Kelley, and that Kelley
</p>
<p>furnished the detectives a copy of the sal soda and
</p>
<p>emery circular, represented to have been sent out
</p>
<p>signed by the two chairmen. Squealer Kelley, as he
</p>
<p>was called, was a switch engineer in the Chicago
</p>
<p>yards for the Burlington, and was taken into the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood of Engineers after the strike began. He
</p>
<p>had sailed under an alias, as Charles Cordell. He fig-
</p>
<p>ured conspicuously as a ' defamer ' in the case of Sophia
</p>
<p>Havelich vs. the Chicago Hansom Cab Co. This
</p>
<p>lady was injured by the carelessness of a cab driver,
</p>
<p>and Kelly was employed by the agent of the Cab Co.
</p>
<p>to rent a room of the lady's mother for the express
</p>
<p>purpose of acting as a spy. He applied for a room
</p>
<p>and was told they had none furnished. Kelley report-
</p>
<p>ed to the agent, and was instructed to rent the room
</p>
<p>and it would be furnished, which was done." 2 In the

<p>ters and other places of amusement, when she claimed
</p>
<p>to have been sick. Kelley testified that he saw her
</p>
<p>go to the theater, and on cross examination by attor-
</p>
<p>neysjohn Gibbons andTreffy, they attempted to make
</p>
<p>him admit that he was a paid spy. Kelley found that
</p>
<p>the value of his evidence would be greatly impaired if
</p>
<p>he admitted that, and he began to prevaricate, in order
</p>
<p>to free himself. Evasions were so patent, that judge
</p>
<p>Altgeld's temper arose, and he promptly ordered him
</p>
<p>from the witness stand, and said he had a great mind
</p>
<p>to send him to jail for contempt. The jury returned
</p>
<p>a verdict for $3,500, in favor of Miss Havelich. the
</p>
<p>evidence showing that it was through the drunkenness
</p>
<p>of the driver that she w r as run over." 1 This specimen
</p>
<p>of human depravity who loaned himself for this despic-
</p>
<p>able work against a woman, was one of the main wit-
</p>
<p>nesses in the dynamite case.

<p>company.'" 1 lie wanted to do something desperate
</p>
<p>in order to show that he was really converted. He
</p>
<p>was taken inlo the Brotherhood April 22. Before this,
</p>
<p>dynamite had never been thought of. Bowles testified
</p>
<p>before the examining magistrate at Aurora Jutv 25,
</p>
<p>that at a regular meeting two weeks after he was in-
</p>
<p>Mated, and in the presence of all there assembled, that
</p>
<p>"John A. Beaureisen made a statement that the com-
</p>
<p>pany was getting the best of them, and that there had
</p>
<p>to be something done, and advised the use of dvna-
</p>
<p>mile and talked it so that all could hear it. While
</p>
<p>every man present at that meeting swore that no such
</p>
<p>statement was ever made," s and from my own knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of the men, and the Brotherhood, no such lan-
</p>
<p>guage could have been used without bringing a storm
</p>
<p>of indignation. Men of undoubted integrity were
</p>
<p>present. That the statement was a lie needs no proof.
</p>
<p>Bowles testified on page 34. Q. by Mr. Donahue.
</p>
<p>What was it that he (meaning Beaureisen) said to
</p>
<p>you ? A. I made mention to him that I  oh, you are
</p>
<p>the one that began the conversation, was it after the
</p>
<p>meeting was over ? A. Yes, sir. It would seem
</p>
<p>from this that Bowles instead of Beaureisen was work-
</p>
<p>ing the dynamite plot. At the preliminary examination
</p>
<p>in Chicago, Bowles is taken with another spasm of
</p>
<p>contrition, and goes over to the side of the prosecution.
</p>
<p>Under cross examination bv Mr. Donahue, Bowles
</p>
<p>admitted he had told both attorneys for the defense
</p>
<p>while in the county jail, that he was an innocent man;
</p>
<p>that he did not know anything of the use of dynamite,
</p>
<p>and that he had lied repeatedly to them and others as
</p>
<p>to his innocence, and about other matters. "But," he

</p>
<p>added naively, "I was not on oath then." '
</p>
<p>When arrested, Bowles had a satchel with him hav-
</p>
<p>ing all the damaging evidence possible, conveniently-
</p>
<p>stored in it, for his own conviction, and to compromise
</p>
<p>others. This acknowledged liar is main witness No.
</p>
<p>2. Bowles had retained attorneys Donahue and
</p>
<p>David, but instead of consulting with them, he had
</p>
<p>consulted with the attorneys for the prosecution, and
</p>
<p>by their advice waived examination. This brought
</p>
<p>such a scathing rebuke of the court and the attorneys
</p>
<p>for the prosecution from Messrs. Donahue and David
</p>
<p>that the court ordered Mr. David removed. The
</p>
<p>prosecution asked for a continuance, and Mr. Don-
</p>
<p>ahue opposed it. The court said, "If the furtherance
</p>
<p>demands it, it will have to be granted."
</p>
<p>Bowles arose from his chair and took a few steps
</p>
<p>toward the court. With his head turned toward the
</p>
<p>judge and half averted from the gaze of the specta-
</p>
<p>tors, with his right hand outstretched in the attitude
</p>
<p>of appeal, and in a voice that seemed to tremble in its
</p>
<p>tones, he said: "It is tor the interest of justice, your
</p>
<p>honor. This will be for the good of the public. AH
</p>
<p>that I will say here will only be for the sake of jus-
</p>
<p>tice, and to prove that I am an innocent man." '
</p>
<p>Alexander Smith, a fireman who was arrested as a
</p>
<p>co-conspirator with Bowles, testified that Bowles
</p>
<p>worked him into the conspiracv, and induced him to
</p>
<p>go to Eola where Bowles put the dynamite on the
</p>
<p>track. Bowles also left dynamite in the room occu-
</p>
<p>pied by A. Koegal, which caused Koegal's arrest as
</p>
<p>an accomplice. It seemed to be his business to rub
</p>
<p>the stuff against as many as possible in Aurora, in

<p>Creston and in Galesburg. On page 117 of the
</p>
<p>court record Bowles is asked. "Are you an innocent
</p>
<p>man?" And he answered," of course I cannot be consi-
</p>
<p>dered an innocent man, but I have been led into this
</p>
<p>by mean and unprincipled men."
</p>
<p>The warrant upon which the men were arrested on
</p>
<p>the train, July 5, was sworn out in Chicago in the
</p>
<p>morning and the arrest was made in the afternoon;
</p>
<p>this arrest included J. A. Bowles, Thomas Broderick
</p>
<p>and J. Q. Wilson. A fourth man was with them but
</p>
<p>the Pinkerton agent said he got away.
</p>
<p>In the preliminary trial it was developed that Wil-
</p>
<p>son was not an engineer, not a Brotherhood man, and
</p>
<p>not even Wilson. His name was John Mulligan, and
</p>
<p>he was a Pinkerton detective, and not only this was the
</p>
<p>case, but it appears he has had the confidence of all
</p>
<p>the prisoners and their attorneys.
</p>
<p>The expose was brought about by lawyer Donahue
</p>
<p>too closelv pressing the cross examination of Superin-
</p>
<p>tendent McGinn of the Pinkerton agency, who was
</p>
<p>on the witness stand. The superintendent had the
</p>
<p>alternative of an awkward refusal to answer pertinent
</p>
<p>questions concerning Wilson, or cause the latter to
</p>
<p>show up in his true colors. McGinn chose the latter.
</p>
<p>Wilson or Mulligan obeyed a signal, went across the
</p>
<p>room to the side of the persecution.
</p>
<p>It was developed latter, that the fourth man was also
</p>
<p>a Pinkerton man named Ray. Mulligan alias Wilson,
</p>
<p>had been in the employ of the Burlington since Feb.
</p>
<p>29. Mulligan and Ray made the acquaintance of

</p>
<p>from their own evidence, is that they we're companions
</p>
<p>of Broderick, they were not shadowing him, but with
</p>
<p>him, drinking his whisky, and doing divers things of
</p>
<p>a social nature. There is no evidence given by them,
</p>
<p>that they never entered into any of these violations of
</p>
<p>law, but they went to St. Joseph, Mo., with him, to
</p>
<p>Kansas Citv with him, to Chicago with him, and
</p>
<p>to Aurora with him, always with clean hands,
</p>
<p>but always around when Broderick got so full
</p>
<p>of dynamite, and violations of law that he could
</p>
<p>not hold it anv longer, he would have some one
</p>
<p>handy to tell it to. It hardly seems probable, that
</p>
<p>Broderick or any sensible man, would pick up a tramp
</p>
<p>cooper, and a gambler and give them all of his con-
</p>
<p>fidence and they do nothing, but be attentive listen-
</p>
<p>ers. If they did not enter into this conspiracy, how did
</p>
<p>they know that Bowles and Broderick were going to
</p>
<p>board the train at Aurora in the afternoon having
</p>
<p>dynamite in their possession and have a warrant sworn
</p>
<p>out at 8 o'clock a. m. to arrest men who were to com-
</p>
<p>mit a crime at 2 :i5 p. m.? The weight of this great trial
</p>
<p>fell upon John A. Bauereisen; his good character was

<p>proven bv witness after witness to have been of the

<p>very best.

</p>
<p>had conveniently stored in his satchel when arrested,
</p>
<p>which Henry L. Tolman, an expert who had made a
</p>
<p>special study of handwriting for eight years by means
</p>
<p>of the microscope, somewhat startled the prosecution
</p>
<p>when upon the stand he testified that the letters pur-
</p>
<p>porting to come from Bauereisen had been written by
</p>
<p>two and possibly three persons.
</p>
<p>When the case was closed and ready for the jury,
</p>
<p>the Aurora Express of Dec. 20, located at the home of
</p>
<p>J. A. Bauereisen, with a personal acquaintance with
</p>
<p>witnesses, and the surrounding circumstances, said:
</p>
<p>"The dark clouds which have hung over the head of J.
</p>
<p>A. Bauereisen for the past six months are beginning
</p>
<p>to grow brighter, and gradually to be dispelled.
</p>
<p>There is an old saying that you can't tell what a jury
</p>
<p>will do, and although it applies to this case, it seems
</p>
<p>very probable that the jury will not convict. They
</p>
<p>may disagree, but probably will acquit the prisoner.
</p>
<p>When the prosecution were presenting such an array
</p>
<p>of black testimony against Bauereisen, it looked to
</p>
<p>some as if nothing could save him, but the defense are
</p>
<p>clearing up matters wonderfully. When it comes to a
</p>
<p>question of veracity between such men as El wood
</p>
<p>Tucker, George Minott, Joseph Porter and others,
</p>
<p>and the self-confessed villian Bowles, none in Aurora
</p>
<p>will have any difficulty in knowing whom to believe."
</p>
<p>In his address to the jury Mr. Mills denounced the
</p>
<p>perjury that he said had been exposed in the case.
</p>
<p>"There has been outrageous perjury-" he said;
</p>
<p>"perjury so palpable as to need no exposing; perjury
</p>
<p>so outrageous as to damn the perjurers; perjury so
</p>
<p>marvelous as to stamp the perjurers as worse than

<p>fiends and fit only for the blackest depths of infernal
</p>
<p>punishment. Akin to perjury is the motive for it, and
</p>
<p>we shall see without much of an effort the reason for
</p>
<p>the horrible perjury which has made dark, one page
</p>
<p>of the history of this court room. The vitality, the
</p>
<p>strength of this prosecution is in two men, John Alex-
</p>
<p>ander Bowles and Alexander Smith." Mr. Mills re-
</p>
<p>viewed every statement they had uttered, contrasted
</p>
<p>the overwhelming evidence on the other, and piled to
</p>
<p>their charge perjury after perjury.
</p>
<p>Messrs. Donahue, David and Mills, of Chicago,
</p>
<p>Alshuler of Aurora, and Irwin of Elgin, were the prin-
</p>
<p>cipal attorneys for the defense. With only the influence
</p>
<p>of an individual and his personal friends and well wishers
</p>
<p>on the side of the defense, it was an unequal contest pit-
</p>
<p>ted against a prosecution representing the great Bur-
</p>
<p>lington corporation, wanting to break the power of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood, and thePinkerton agency unscrupulous in
</p>
<p>practice, and whose future in such work for corpora-
</p>
<p>tions depended upon conviction.
</p>
<p>The eloquent Mr. Mills in closing his address said:
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury:  You will be govern-
</p>
<p>ed by the truthful testimony you have heard and the
</p>
<p>obligations of your oath. You will therefore, I know
</p>
<p>certainly do, as I have the assurance and hope that
</p>
<p>you will, give to this defendant the justice he de-
</p>
<p>mands and the vindication which is his right.
</p>
<p>The audience, which had been held spellbound,
</p>
<p>burst into loud cheering, but were sternly called to or-
</p>
<p>der by the judge, who expressed his disapproval of such

<p>Bauereisen was sentenced

</p>
<p>CHAPTER L.
</p>
<p>THE END OF THE GREAT STRIKE.
</p>
<p>The committee of nine, named in Chapter xlvii,
</p>
<p>held their first meeting in Chicago, Dec. 27, 18SS.
</p>
<p>The chairman of this committee, Mr. A. R. Cavner,
</p>
<p>in order to carry as much weight as possible with the
</p>
<p>mmittee he represented, called to Chicago the gen-
</p>
<p>eral grievance committee men within a given radius, to
</p>
<p>confer with them, and find how much of a unit in s< -
</p>
<p>timent remained that could be used as a power to
</p>
<p>compel concessions on the part of the Burlington.
</p>
<p>The Union meetings at St. Joseph, Mo., in July, had
</p>
<p>demonstrated almost a unit on the boycott, but the
</p>
<p>Kansas City meeting was conservative, the St. L01 -
</p>
<p>meeting was still more so, and the action of the con-
</p>
<p>vention in refusing to pass a federation law. put the
</p>
<p>possibility still farther away, and the Chicago meeting
</p>
<p>proved conclusively the impossibility of an aggressive
</p>
<p>move, the vote on the boycott standing 22 for, to 43
</p>
<p>against. Mr. Cavner had been over the line of the
</p>
<p>Burlington, and had found the men holding their
</p>
<p>ground, and doing whatever it was possible for them
</p>
<p>to do, with their influence, to boycott the road. The
</p>
<p>Brotherhood throughout the country were doing the
</p>
<p>same, to a more or less extent, and this power was
</p>
<p>greatly felt in the west, where the Knights of Labor
</p>
<p>through their good will for the strikers, refused to ride

</p>
<p>it. Mr. Cavner visited each point where the men
</p>
<p>were located, and delivered an address to them, which
</p>
<p>was very, encouraging. Mr. Cavner no doubt, ad-
</p>
<p>duced from the many promises, easily given, and the
</p>
<p>power he believed lay dormant, which would only
</p>
<p>need a little spirited discussion to bring into new life,
</p>
<p>that much might be accomplished for the strikers in
</p>
<p>this last act, by the committee appointed at the engi-
</p>
<p>neers' convention for the express purpose of settling
</p>
<p>the strike. But he counted without his host, and the
</p>
<p>anticipated power did not materialize. A difference
</p>
<p>in opinion is not a difference in principle. The men
</p>
<p>were all anxious to do something for the striking en<ri-
</p>
<p>neers, but ten months after the inception of the strike,
</p>
<p>- too late a day to vote to do what would, in all
</p>
<p>probability, have endangered other men's places, with-
</p>
<p>out any assurance that it it would benefit those in whose
</p>
<p>interest the effort was to be made. The vote upon an
</p>
<p>vessive move should not have been taken. Men
</p>
<p>will talk, and the very influence that was anticipated
</p>
<p>from the presence of these leading committeemen was
</p>
<p>killed, with the positive knowledge of their strength
</p>
<p>in that direction, divulged by the vote, presumption
</p>
<p>was worth more than fact, as it would leave the offi-
</p>
<p>cials in doubt, while the vote assured them that noth-
</p>
<p>could be done more than was being done by per-
</p>
<p>sonal, sympathetic boycotting, and the desire on the
</p>
<p>part of the Burlington officials to get rid of this bov-
</p>
<p>cott and ill feeling, which had been engendered to-
</p>
<p>wards that company, was the only apparent incentive
</p>
<p>for any settlement at all.

<p>454 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>of the conditions on the part of the Brotherhoods

<p>must be, that, so far as it was in their power, the em-
</p>
<p>bargo should be raised, and the company left without
</p>
<p>hindrance, to regain its old customers if it could. The
</p>
<p>committee of nine, as a whole, were extremely conser-
</p>
<p>vative, and it is a very reasonable supposition that
</p>
<p>they were known to be so when appointed. This

<p>equally interested, Mr. Cavner requested Grand Mas-
</p>
<p>ter Sargent to appoint a committee to act with them.

<p>Mr. Sargent, feeling that he had been slighted in this

<p>sent the firemen.
</p>
<p>An audience with the Burlington officials was solicit-
</p>
<p>ed and granted. The ground was gone over in a
</p>
<p>lengthy discussion, and finally President Perkins was
</p>
<p>telegraphed at Boston to define the position, which
</p>
<p>was done in the following dispatch :
</p>
<p>"Boston, Jan. 3, 1889.
</p>
<p>To Henry B. Stone, Vice-President C, B. & Q.

<p>Railroad, Chicago.
</p>
<p>"I am authorized and instructed by the executive

<p>committee now in session, to send you the following :
</p>
<p>The company will not follow up, black list, or in any
</p>
<p>manner attempt to proscribe those who were con-
</p>
<p>cerned in the strike, but on the contrary, will cheer-
</p>
<p>fully give, to all who have not been guilty of violence,
</p>
<p>or other improper conduct, letters of introduction,
</p>
<p>showing their record in our service, and will in all
</p>
<p>proper ways, assist them in finding employment.

<p>The first duty of the management, is to those who are

<p>THE END OF THE GREAT STRIKE. 455
</p>
<p>in the company's employ, and we must remember and
</p>
<p>protect their interests, by promotion, and by every
</p>
<p>other means in our power. Beyond this if it should
</p>
<p>become necessary to go outside of the service for men
</p>
<p>in any capacity, it is our intention to select the best
</p>
<p>men available, and in making selections, not to exclude
</p>
<p>those who engaged in the strike of February 27, if they
</p>
<p>are the best men available, provided they have not since
</p>
<p>been guilty of violence and other improper conduct."
</p>
<p>(Signed) C. E. Perkins.
</p>
<p>On receipf'of this document Mr. Stone was asked to
</p>
<p>define the word available, and the following is his eva-
</p>
<p>sive reply:
</p>
<p>" It is important that no question should arise as to
</p>
<p>the good faith of the company, and it is our desire and
</p>
<p>intention that there should be no opportunity for such
</p>
<p>question."
</p>
<p>" As to the meaning of the word available, I desire
</p>
<p>to say that when it becomes necessary to employ men
</p>
<p>outside of those now in our service, care must be taken
</p>
<p>to consider all of the qualifications that go to make up
</p>
<p>availability, including experience and familiarity with
</p>
<p>our surroundings and rules. In short, that the very
</p>
<p>best men are to be selected, regardless of personal re-
</p>
<p>lations or prejudices for or against any man or class
</p>
<p>of men."
</p>
<p>"While men who have been guilty of improper con-
</p>
<p>duct during the late strike, cannot be re-employed, and
</p>
<p>while we cannot give letters to them, no officer or em-
</p>
<p>ploye, should continue the animosities of the conflict
</p>
<p>after it is over, or interfere to prevent the employment

</p>
<p>The company also agreed they would re-em-
</p>
<p>ploy what men they needed from the ranks of their
</p>
<p>former employes, 'iand all striking engineers, firemen,
</p>
<p>switchmen, and brakemen were instructed to file their
</p>
<p>applications at their respective division headquarters
</p>
<p>if they desired re-employment, on or before Febru-
</p>
<p>ary, 1SS9. This advice was given at the request of
</p>
<p>the officials of the company. " The conditions were
</p>
<p>accepted by Mr. Cavner's committee, and the strike
</p>
<p>declared off. The men along the line complied with
</p>
<p>the instructions and sent in a list of names of'those who de-
</p>
<p>sired re-employment. The list was accepted by the com-
</p>
<p>pany's officials, but they required that each one should
</p>
<p>make personal application, which most of them did.
</p>
<p>A committee was appointed by the chairman of the
</p>
<p>committee of nine, consisting of A. W. Perley, and H.
</p>
<p>C. Hayes with S. W. Dixon for the firemen, who
</p>
<p>were instructed to go over the system and explain the
</p>
<p>conditions. The strikers were generallv indignant,
</p>
<p>and the reception of these gentlemen was anvthing but
</p>
<p>a pleasant one. An undue buoyancy of mind had been
</p>
<p>engendered by what Mr. Cavner had said he expected
</p>
<p>to accomplish, and their own imagination of what the
</p>
<p>committee of nine could do, with the reality as present-
</p>
<p>ed by these gentlemen, was a grievous disappointment;
</p>
<p>not that they expected a surrender on the part of the
</p>
<p>Burlington, but they expected more than was given,
</p>
<p>or nothing.
</p>
<p>They had manfully battled against all odds for elev-
</p>
<p>en months; hundreds of them had refused places on

</p>
<p>without an army. They had given their sacrifices un-
</p>
<p>stintinglv for the common cause, and the settlement
</p>
<p>embodied in Mr. Perkin's dispatch, without other
</p>
<p>written conditions, meant practically " You stop boy-
</p>
<p>cotting us, and we will not boycott you." The
</p>
<p>other conditions, "selecting men from the old employes
</p>
<p>as they needed men," has not been lived up to on any
</p>
<p>part of the line except the Hannibal and St. Joseph,
</p>
<p>and there the engineers are asked to go to work as lire-
</p>
<p>men. The letters, with few exceptions, were
</p>
<p>simply statements, the substance of which was : "John
</p>
<p>Smith commenced work for the C, B. & Q., as a tire-
</p>
<p>man January, 1880, was promoted to engineer in 1884,
</p>
<p>and quit the service on account of strike, February 27,
</p>
<p>188S." Some of them said lie gave satisfaction, while
</p>
<p>a very few were real recommendations, the best letters
</p>
<p>coming from Mr- Stone himself, but Mr. Stone's own
</p>
<p>letter giving the. very best of a recomendation, has, to
</p>
<p>my knowledge, failed to secure place on the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton, because of the animosity of the local officials.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone had said the animosities should not continue
</p>
<p>after the conflict was over, but it is apparently as
</p>
<p>rancorous to-day as ever, with some of the officials.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stone has lived up to his own declarations.
</p>
<p>Transportation has been furnished, good letters bear-
</p>
<p>ing his signature have been given to some of the old
</p>
<p>men, and favors of whatever nature that have been
</p>
<p>extended to the old men since the strike was declared
</p>
<p>off, are from the man who said " I never will con-
</p>
<p>cede it." But that ever present element of discord in

<p>is a positive barrier against any good- will policy, and

<p>45 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>what few old men are left along the line should seek
</p>
<p>new fields, and leave the Burlington to enjoy its new
</p>
<p>company.
</p>
<p>The Burlington strike, the most vigorously fought
</p>
<p>on both sides of any strike in the history of our coun-
</p>
<p>try, causing an immense loss of wealth, the sacrifice
</p>
<p>of place, the separation of friends, and the creator of
</p>
<p>enmities, ought to have in it, a lesson that would be as
</p>
<p>lasting as the pyramids of Egypt, but until corporate
</p>
<p>autocracy is changed to autonomy, that cannot be ex-
</p>
<p>pected. The Brotherhood lost the fight because it
</p>
<p>did not have the machinery to concentrate the power
</p>
<p>it possessed, and 'No alliances,' like the drunkard's
</p>
<p>whisky, created the vipers that sting it.
</p>
<p>The firemen and engineers made a grand fight. I
</p>
<p>put the firemen first, because they were just as stead-
</p>
<p>fast, with less at stake than the engineers. They
</p>
<p>stood together like brothers, through thick and thin to
</p>
<p>the end, and the Burlington strikers should feel no
</p>
<p>disgrace at defeat; they believed they were right
</p>
<p>when they struck, they still believe they were right.
</p>
<p>The preservation of the Brotherhoods in their present
</p>
<p>standing is due to the tenacity with which they stood
</p>
<p>their ground. Had the strike been declared off in the first
</p>
<p>week of March as was advised, the Atchison, Topeka &
</p>
<p>Santa Fe would not. have asked for a. loan from their
</p>
<p>enginemen, they would have taken it to have and to keep,
</p>
<p>wages would have been reduced and the Brotherhood's
</p>
<p>power to resist would have been gone. They voted to
</p>
<p>stand their ground against all advisors, and by so doing
</p>
<p>they formed the nucleus, around which, gathered and

<p>solidified the shocked vitality of the Brotherhoods

<p>THE END OF THE GREAT STRIKE. 459
</p>
<p>and gave opportunity to realize the danger to their
</p>
<p>future and convert indifference into energetic help.
</p>
<p>The current of good will became wonderful, mon-
</p>
<p>ey flowed like water from the National camp of the
</p>
<p>Brotherhoods, all labor came closer together, the
</p>
<p>Burlington strikers being the magnet of centralization,
</p>
<p>and at the close of the strike the Brotherhoods stood
</p>
<p>with vitality and numbers unimpaired; the strikers
</p>
<p>themselves were great losers, but there must be mar-
</p>
<p>tyrs in any cause, and this is no exception. The
</p>
<p>younger men will find place and regain lost ground.
</p>
<p>But there are some men past the age for' new fields,
</p>
<p>whose sacrifice, in the interest of their fellowmen, em-
</p>
<p>bodied their whole future. They must wait patiently
</p>
<p>for that last trip, over the river, and make their last
</p>
<p>report to the great master mechanic, their Redeemer,
</p>
<p>who shall estimate this sacrifice. It is hoped none of
</p>
<p>them will be permitted to make an intermediate trip,
</p>
<p>"over the hill to the poor house."
</p>
<p>Wi*.h this exception the effect of the strike to the
</p>
<p>Brotherhoods is entirely eliminated; the lesson it
</p>
<p>taught remains. How is it with their opponents, the
</p>
<p>Burlington management?

</p>
<p>and for the corresponding period the year before $25,-
</p>
<p>412, 699 and $13, 885,936.
</p>
<p>The Union Pacific keeping up all its departments is
</p>
<p>short for 1887, $731,338, while the Burlington with the
</p>
<p>greatest possible retrenchment in even' department,
</p>
<p>shows a loss of $6,164,385. Following this comes
</p>
<p>the March statement of the Chicago, Burlington &
</p>
<p>Quincy. In connection with statements previously made
</p>
<p>it showed that during the first quarter of 1889 the
</p>
<p>road did not even pay its interest charges, being sever-
</p>
<p>al hundred thousand dollars short. The total net
</p>
<p>earnings for the three months ending March 31 were,
</p>
<p>for the Burlington proper and the Burlington & Mis-
</p>
<p>souri River roads, $1,579,941. The interest charges
</p>
<p>alone are approximately $550,000 per month. In ad-
</p>
<p>dition to the interest charges, which have not been
</p>
<p>earned, the Burlington company is paying dividends
</p>
<p>at the rate of 1 per cent quarterly, which still further
</p>
<p>swells the expenditures above the net earnings.
</p>
<p>While financial disaster follows the Burlington, the
</p>
<p>Union Pacific which pays better wages than was asked
</p>
<p>of the Burlington, shows a net increase for January of
</p>
<p>$172,000, over 1888. The Burlington system has
</p>
<p>deteriorated since the strike of its old employes, from
</p>
<p>the best dividend paying road in the west, to one that
</p>
<p>cannot earn its interest, and from one of the best
</p>
<p>manned roads in its engine department to the poorest,
</p>
<p>as their expense account shows. The following from the
</p>
<p>Aurora News of July 16. 1889, is significant: "Engine
</p>
<p>339 of the main line was burned out at Mendota, Satur-
</p>
<p>day, through the carelessness of the engineer and was

</p>
<p>immediately taken to Galesburg for necessary repairs."
</p>
<p>THE END OF THE GREAT STRIKE. 46 1
</p>
<p>Retrenchment is apparent in the following: "A large
</p>
<p>amount of work continues to accumulate at the differ-
</p>
<p>ent departments of the car shops, especially in the car
</p>
<p>department and repair shops, where worn-out coaches
</p>
<p>and bad order cars of all kinds are rapidly increasing.
</p>
<p>Several tracks in the yards are also crowded with such
</p>
<p>disabled rolling stock."
</p>
<p>When we look at the great depreciation in Burling-
</p>
<p>ton stock, and the immense direct lost the company
</p>
<p>has sustained, and from a surplus of two millions, to a
</p>
<p>borrower of ten, we wonder if the reader will think
</p>
<p>the Burlington, in defeating the Brotherhood, won the
</p>
<p>battle. They have run their own business, or rather,
</p>
<p>they have run other peoples', to suit themselves. They
</p>
<p>cornered the labor market in a vast territory, and then
</p>
<p>went on the principle that "Providence had sent a few
</p>
<p>men into the world, ready booted and spurred to ride,
</p>
<p>and thousands ready saddled and bridled to be
</p>
<p>ridden." The Burlington strike should be the last of
</p>
<p>its kind, but until railway managers realize their
</p>
<p>responsibilities to all shareholders, to the public, and
</p>
<p>the rights of the labor they control, we cannot expect
</p>
<p>such a blessing, labor will not meekly give up its rights
</p>
<p>and liberties, and until corporations shall "have dared to
</p>
<p>come up to the spirit of the pilgrim covenant of 1620
</p>
<p>and shall declare that all men shall be consulted in re-
</p>
<p>gard to the disposition of their lives, liberties and
</p>
<p>property, strikes will remain possibilities. The Pil-
</p>
<p>grim fathers proceeded on the doctrine, that everv man
</p>
<p>was supposed to know what he wanted, and had the
</p>
<p>right to a voice in the disposition of himself."

<p>As these conditions have not materialized, the use-
</p>
<p>462 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>fulness of organized labor is not over. Avoiding
</p>
<p>strikes should be one of their cardinal principles.
</p>
<p>Arbitration, the recognized mediator, and balance of
</p>
<p>justice, another. But the Burlington strike has dem-
</p>
<p>onstrated the fact that power is necessary to compel
</p>
<p>the use of these peaceful means. The Brotherhood
</p>
<p>should not forget, that evils which accrue to other
</p>
<p>laboring men, bear as heavily upon one as the other.
</p>
<p>In writing this book I have been actuated by a desire
</p>
<p>to soften asperity, and remove the causes of discord
</p>
<p>and doubt, that organized labor might come nearer to-
</p>
<p>gether and practice the golden rule  " Do unto others
</p>
<p>as you would they should do unto you." Washing-
</p>
<p>ton said " To prepare for war was one of the most ef-
</p>
<p>fectual means of preserving the peace." As long as
</p>
<p>trusts and corporations exist, so long will legal or moral
</p>
<p>restraint be necessary. As there are no legal restraints,
</p>
<p>organized labor must protect itself. A part of the
</p>
<p>province of this work has been to show the conditions
</p>
<p>that have made the organization of labor necessary,
</p>
<p>but it has not been done with any malice or attempt
</p>
<p>to injure any party, and if the reader shall find any-
</p>
<p>thing commendable within these pages and the work
</p>
<p>shall tend to greater harmony among laboring men,
</p>
<p>and lead to more pacific relations between labor and
</p>
<p>capital, the compiler will feel that his first and only ef-
</p>
<p>fort has not been without good results.

</p>
<p>OF

<p>CHARLES H. FRISBIE,
</p>
<p>FOR
</p>
<p>FORTY-SEVEN YEARS A LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEER.
</p>
<p>The author and writer of this short life-story first
</p>
<p>saw the light in Cortland county, New York,
</p>
<p>in 1822. My father was a farmer and a hotel-
</p>
<p>keeper. It was an old-time kind of a hotel, with a
</p>
<p>swinging sign, ample grounds, and a house that grew
</p>
<p>by additions. There was nothing small at an old
</p>
<p>style hotel but the prices. The customers were not
</p>
<p>the loafers of the town but were private travelers in
</p>
<p>their own carriages or on horseback, or movers, or
</p>
<p>drovers, or stage coach loads of passengers. There
</p>
<p>were no railroads then and farm wagons carried down
</p>
<p>to the city the products of the farm: or light teams
</p>
<p>of two horses, with light loads for short journeys,
</p>
<p>made the roads lively. The roads were for months
</p>
<p>impassable till a turnpike company elevated and lev-
</p>
<p>eled the road, put on gates, and charged toll of all
</p>
<p>travelers. Droves of fat cattle and sheep and hogs
</p>
<p>from western New York, walked to their fate in the
</p>
<p>city, two or three hundred miles away. Drivers
</p>
<p>were hired for a song, and the lazy herds would walk

<p>four or five miles a day, and would increase in weight
</p>
<p>464 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>on the journey, enough to pay the traveling expenses.
</p>
<p>These country inns were usually five ' to six miles
</p>
<p>apart, and afforded a local market for hay and corn,
</p>
<p>but at what we should now call give away rates.
</p>
<p>Now, you can load a car with stock thousands of
</p>
<p>miles w r est and get to market quicker than you could
</p>
<p>then from western New York. People grew tired of
</p>
<p>the slow work and began to think of a more rapid
</p>
<p>transit. Then came the Erie canal from Buffalo to
</p>
<p>Albany with its 363 miles in length which cost nearly
</p>
<p>eight millions of dollars, built by the state, and a mon-
</p>
<p>ument of the genius of Governor DeWitt Clinton,
</p>
<p>completed in 1825. When the ground was broken
</p>
<p>for that canal, on July 4th, 181 7, my father often said
</p>
<p>he never expected that he or any of his children
</p>
<p>would live to see it completed. Yet they all did live
</p>
<p>to see it and many long years after. The writer of
</p>
<p>these lines lived to see it and, up to this writing, sixty-
</p>
<p>four years more. Many of us remember similar talk of
</p>
<p>the Union and Central Pacific railways. But no improve-
</p>
<p>ments in this country gave such a powerful stimulant
</p>
<p>to enterprise as the Erie canal. The immediate im-
</p>
<p>migration to the state was immmense, new cities
</p>
<p>sprang up, and wealth poured in upon the people from
</p>
<p>every source. The lake crafts carried grain to Buf-
</p>
<p>falo, and the canal boats took it to the sea coast, and
</p>
<p>the lowered expense of transportation lined the pock-
</p>
<p>ets of the farmer, and quickened trade of every
</p>
<p>kind.
</p>
<p>Now, gentle reader, you have followed me along
</p>

<p>creeping canal boat and go by steam. A horse rail-
</p>
<p>road was finished at Quincy, Mass., about the same
</p>
<p>time that the Erie canal was completed, and, for the
</p>
<p>next fifteen years, a powerful head of steam in favor
</p>
<p>of railroads left canals far behind. About that time
</p>
<p>the New York Central was built from Albany by
</p>
<p>Schenectady and Syracuse to Buffalo. We did not
</p>
<p>build railroads then as we do now. Let us walk out
</p>
<p>along the track and see how they did it. The grad-
</p>
<p>ing was done, then much as now. Now comes the
</p>
<p>track. Teams of two or four horses would draw
</p>
<p>from the sawmill, beams eight inches thick, and as
</p>
<p>wide as the tree would allow, and as near as may be
</p>
<p>to forty feet long. This was the foundation or mud-
</p>
<p>sill. It was sunk even with the surface of the ground.
</p>
<p>These sills w r ere laid along continuously, one on each
</p>
<p>side. Then come the cross-ties, split out of white
</p>
<p>oak with cavities to fit an eight inch wooden rail,
</p>
<p>then comes a three by two inch wooden ribbon
</p>
<p>and then on top of that an iron bar, one-inch thick by
</p>
<p>two and a half inches wade. Now on this cobble house
</p>
<p>you may bring on the cars, one by one, slowly, but,
</p>
<p>alas for the engineers and the firemen ! the engines
</p>
<p>were mules, one, tw r o, or three; according to grades,
</p>
<p>or length of train. That was my first engineering! I
</p>
<p>held the throttle of those four-footed engines for
</p>
<p>about a year. We thought the railroads would revo-
</p>
<p>lutionize the commerce of the world, and so they did
</p>
<p>but not till after the mules were sent to grass.
</p>
<p>The first steam engine run in this country was
</p>
<p>built by Foster, Rastrick & Co., at Stourbridge, Eng.,
</p>
<p>and was put on the Delaware & Hudson canal com-

</p>
<p>pany's railroad in 1829. Mr. Peter Cooper built in
</p>
<p>Baltimore the first engine ever built and run by the
</p>
<p>same man, in America. This was on the Baltimore &
</p>
<p>Ohio in 1830. The supply of American built engines
</p>
<p>was slow, and many were brought from England.
</p>
<p>The three principal makers in this country were Rog-
</p>
<p>ers, Maqueen and Baldwin. Now, reader, you will
</p>
<p>see that I have got far ahead of the mules, and I will
</p>
<p>call a halt.
</p>
<p>Step this way and look at my new engine, the Phoe-
</p>
<p>nix. George Howard of the Utica road is engineer.
</p>
<p>Then comes the Varrum, with Perk Howard at the
</p>
<p>throttle. The next was the Wyoming, built in the
</p>
<p>Auburn state prison. On board of her I had the honor
</p>
<p>to be extra fireman. Melank Mason was master me-
</p>
<p>chanic, and Milt Alcott worked in the roundhouse.
</p>
<p>He was the man who built the first head light in the
</p>
<p>United States. The reflector was made of a kind of
</p>
<p>habbitt metal with sixteen silver dollars melted in it.
</p>
<p>It was about half as big as our present lamp. The
</p>
<p>first head light I ever saw was made of wood and re-
</p>
<p>sembled the shape of my mother's sun bonnet, only it
</p>
<p>had one glass in front. The back and sides were
</p>
<p>lined with tin, and the light was about a two candle
</p>
<p>power. A bright full moon would make it look sickly.
</p>
<p>Now, reader, if you intend to stay by me, you will
</p>
<p>have to pull up your stakes and come along. We set
</p>
<p>out now from Auburn, on the New York Central, and
</p>
<p>at Albany take the steamer Alida for New York City,
</p>
<p>on which the fare  thanks to competition  is twenty-
</p>
<p>five cents. Let us take the Cortland St. ferry for

<p>FORTY-SEVEN YEARS AN ENGINEER. 467
</p>
<p>Philadelphia train, Howell Roe, engineer, Charley
</p>
<p>McCleary, fireman. I soon met with the old sweeper
</p>
<p>at the depot and learned that there was a fireman
</p>
<p>wanted for that train, and that Tim Smith was the
</p>
<p>boss. I found him. and in three minutes I had the
</p>
<p>first regular job I ever had on a railroad. Now, my
</p>
<p>overalls take their place, and I am assistant fireman on
</p>
<p>the engine Jersey City. All engines had names then,
</p>
<p>not numbers as now, and 1 was happy as a lark. The
</p>
<p>engineer got fifty dollars a month, first fireman twen-
</p>
<p>ty-five, and myself, the assistant twenty. Board was
</p>
<p>one dollar fifty a week, and cigars two for one cent.
</p>
<p>The kind of engines used on the New Jersey Cen-
</p>
<p>tral road was the Baldwin make and the Rogers, both
</p>
<p>kinds from American shops. These ran between Jer-
</p>
<p>sey city and New Brunswick. From New Bruns-
</p>
<p>wick to Trenton they used English engines.
</p>
<p>New Brunswick was the meeting place of the two
</p>
<p>different kinds or make of engine. It so happened
</p>
<p>that the Uncle Sam from the New Jersey road stood
</p>
<p>over night side by side with the John Bull from the
</p>
<p>Camden and Amboy road.
</p>
<p>None of the engines, then, had whistles. In or-
</p>
<p>der to give a signal to apply the brakes, the engineer
</p>
<p>had to raise the safety valve, which made a noise sim-
</p>
<p>ilar to one you would make in driving a snooping cat
</p>
<p>out of mischief, and not much louder.
</p>
<p>Every night after we had put our train away, we
</p>
<p>had to go on a side track to get water. Not a drop
</p>
<p>was there outside of the well, consequently it had to
</p>
<p>be pumped. In order to do the pumping we had to

<p>run the engine on a track over the well, and on a set
</p>
<p>468 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>of wheels, about the size of the driving wheels, which
</p>
<p>were connected with the pump. Then we would
</p>
<p>start the engine slowly, and that would turn the
</p>
<p>wheels connected with the pump, and we would wait
</p>
<p>until the tank was full. That was not very long for
</p>
<p>the tank was small and would run three cars about
</p>
<p>ten miles. After that we backed the engine over the
</p>
<p>Raritan river to the engine house, run the engine on
</p>
<p>the turn table, disconnect the tender from the engine,
</p>
<p>run the engine off the table, push the tender over up-
</p>
<p>on a short side track, run the engine back over the
</p>
<p>table, push the tender upon the table, turn it the rest
</p>
<p>of the way around and push it into the house, then
</p>
<p>turn the engine and back her up to the tank, then fill
</p>
<p>the tank with wood, which was the best of Norway
</p>
<p>pine. That was the best wood I ever saw for gener-
</p>
<p>ating steam, and was had in abundance at one dollar
</p>
<p>and a half a cord.
</p>
<p>Now, after going through with all this process the
</p>
<p>night before, we went down in the morning and got
</p>
<p>the engine out and the train hitched on, ready for
</p>
<p>Jersey City. The engineer takes his seat on the right,
</p>
<p>the first fireman on the left, the second fireman, or
</p>
<p>wood passer, between the engine and the tank, stand-
</p>
<p>ing of course, for there is only room for two on the
</p>
<p>engine. The brakeman always stood on the platform
</p>
<p>on the first car to give signal for brakes.
</p>
<p>Now, it might be interesting to you, patient reader,
</p>
<p>to know what kind of coaches were used at *hat time.
</p>
<p>Well, many of them were four-wheeled, hung on what
</p>
<p>was called thorough braces. I will try and tell vou

</p>
<p>A long time ago when stage coaches were young, the
</p>
<p>FORTY-SEVEN YEARS AN ENGINEER. 469
</p>
<p>coach body swung on thorough braces. The thorough
</p>
<p>brace was made of several layers of strong harness
</p>
<p>leather, six or seven inches wide, and fastened to the
</p>
<p>back and forward bolster, one on each side. Then
</p>
<p>the body of the coach was set on these, and it hung
</p>
<p>in the middle. These strong straps served as springs
</p>
<p>and gave to the coach body an easy movement up or
</p>
<p>down, back or forward. When the coach went rapid-
</p>
<p>ly and suddenly over something either high or low,
</p>
<p>the passengers were often unseated, hit the ceiling with
</p>
<p>their heads, silently exchanged seats, or introduced to
</p>
<p>each other for the fortieth time, in a mode more speedy
</p>
<p>than polite, each one saying nothing but "Oh!"
</p>
<p>These coaches would hold only ten or twelve persons.
</p>
<p>They had to be hauled with horses part of the way
</p>
<p>over Bergen hill, a few miles west of Jersey City, a hill
</p>
<p>that has been tunnelled several times. When Bergen
</p>
<p>hill was passed so that engines could be used instead
</p>
<p>of horses, they used larger cars. Every seat was
</p>
<p>numbered and every car lettered, and your ticket
</p>
<p>called for a seat in a certain letter and number. The
</p>
<p>end doors were locked and the passengers entered a
</p>
<p>side door in the center.
</p>
<p>The principal production of New Jersey, then, 1849,
</p>
<p>was Jersey lightning and buckwheat cakes. Jersey
</p>
<p>lightning was cider brandy, and the buckwheat cakes
</p>
<p>began soon after the first frost, and they never slacked
</p>
<p>up until the shad came in the spring. If you never
</p>
<p>had fresh shad for breakfast you have missed a good
</p>
<p>thing that never can be made up to you. The meal
</p>
<p>that working people made the most of was dinner, and

<p>it was an important matter, but they licked their plates

</p>
<p>for supper. I hope the New Jersey schools are better
</p>
<p>now than fifty years ago, for then, most of the fellows,
</p>
<p>in signing their receipts, made their mark when they
</p>
<p>receipted for their pay.
</p>
<p>Our trains to New Brunswick were light, only two
</p>
<p>or three cars, all coaches, with but one freight train
</p>
<p>on the road. The engines were only fourteen by
</p>
<p>twenty inch cylinder; single driver. The two Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia trains had larger engines, as they had five or
</p>
<p>six cars. Two of their best engines were built by
</p>
<p>Roger's, monsters for those days, six feet double driv-
</p>
<p>ers, cylinder thirteen inch bore, twenty-two inch
</p>
<p>stroke; the smaller engines had ten inch bore by
</p>
<p>twenty inch stroke. One of these large engines went
</p>
<p>with the train from Jersey city to New Brunswick,
</p>
<p>and on nearing the Passaic river the engineer saw
</p>
<p>that the draw was off, but he did not see the danger
</p>
<p>till he was within a fourth of a mile of it. It was too
</p>
<p>late to hold the train and down he went with the en-
</p>
<p>gine and baggage car. There was in the baggage
</p>
<p>car a deadhead who had left New Brunswick that
</p>
<p>very morning, getting on board a steamer in New
</p>
<p>York bay just in time to see the steamer take fire.
</p>
<p>He leaped overboard and was rescued by his swim-
</p>
<p>ming to an island. He was picked up, and took that
</p>
<p>train for home and went down with the engineer.
</p>
<p>There were three draw bridges on that route, over
</p>
<p>the rivers Raritan, Passaic and Hackensack. I have
</p>
<p>known a fog from the ocean to last for three days, so
</p>
<p>dense that you could not see a signal fifty feet ahead.
</p>
<p>After firing about three years I got to be extra en-

<p>gineer. Then I wanted to go home and make a visit
</p>
<p>FORTY-SEVEN YEARS AN ENGINEER. 47 1
</p>
<p>and talk over the news. Now, friendly reader, pack
</p>
<p>3 r our grip and come along, for I may stay some time.
</p>
<p>Now, we take the ferry for New York, the steamer
</p>
<p>for Albany, the cars for Auburn. There we found the
</p>
<p>cars running farther west, and hundreds of horses had
</p>
<p>left the stage coaches for eastern markets.
</p>
<p>About this time there arose a great excitement
</p>
<p>about the Michigan Central railroad, ?.nd everybody
</p>
<p>with his dog was o-oino- there. This road belonged
</p>
<p>to a Boston company at that time, and was built to
</p>
<p>Kalamazoo, having a track of strap iron.
</p>
<p>We now take a steamer for Detroit. There are
</p>
<p>three steamers in one line, London, Canada, and At-
</p>
<p>lantic ; the last named is now at the bottom of the lake.
</p>
<p>She left Buffalo one night with one thousand persons
</p>
<p>on board, but she went down, -and all on board per-
</p>
<p>ished, except two boys by the name of Becker, who
</p>
<p>floated off on a piece of the .wreck. I met these bovs
</p>
<p>more than forty years afterwards.
</p>
<p>The same company afterwards built a floating pal-
</p>
<p>ace, called the May Flower. She was magnificent,
</p>
<p>but she went to the bottom of Lake Erie three times
</p>
<p>and then staid there. About the last time that the
</p>
<p>May Flower went down I was given an engine on the
</p>
<p>Michigan Central, called May Flower, the very engine
</p>
<p>that gave name to the steamer, and she tumbled
</p>
<p>me all over the fields. That was the only engine in
</p>
<p>which I was ever hurt in forty-seven years of engi-
</p>
<p>neering. What's in a name ? Nothing at all, per-
</p>
<p>haps, but all railroads have an engine on which bad
</p>
<p>luck rides oftener than on any other. I was going over

<p>the switch at Dexter, Michigan, when the bar that
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>holds the rails in place, broke and let the May Flower
</p>
<p>down on the frozen ground and ice. She began to
</p>
<p>slew and started up street, and at about fifty feet from
</p>
<p>the track she turned up side down, and where was I ?
</p>
<p>Under her, of course, caught by my left foot with
</p>
<p>steam blowing on it. But my foot was on the ice and
</p>
<p>the steam thawed it loose, when I crawled out with a
</p>
<p>scalded foot and all my bones unbroken.
</p>
<p>Another time I started with the same May Flower
</p>
<p>engine, and when three miles out from Marshall,
</p>
<p>Michigan, I ran over an ox and threw the engine and
</p>
<p>train, every wheel, from the track. The engine rolled
</p>
<p>over twice and a half and lay on her back, fifty feet
</p>
<p>from the track, headed the opposite way. I looked
</p>
<p>around and found myself, and set up my underpinning,
</p>
<p>and on taking an inventory, I found one arm dis-
</p>
<p>abled, m}- face and hands scalded, and my shoulder
</p>
<p>and collarbone were broken. The fireman, poor fel-
</p>
<p>low, fared much worse, and died in a few days. Now,
</p>
<p>teli me what's in a name ? You may laugh, but I left
</p>
<p>the fated May Flower then and forever.
</p>
<p>What did the company do about it ? They paid my
</p>
<p>doctor's bill, they paid my full wages for the full year
</p>
<p>I was laid up. I never entirely gained the use of my
</p>
<p>right arm.
</p>
<p>Now, reader, let me introduce you to officers of the
</p>
<p>Michigan Central. J. W. Brook, general superintend-
</p>
<p>ent; R. N. Rice, assistant superintendent; C. H. Hurd,
</p>
<p>general freight agent; three finer men never lived.

<p>these men have now passed away. The death of S.
</p>
<p>FORTY-SEVEN YEARS AN ENGINEER. 473
</p>
<p>T. Newhall hastened the organization of the Brother-
</p>
<p>hood of Engineers. The man who took Mr. New-
</p>
<p>hall's place was an overbearing tyrant. To resist him,
</p>
<p>and to secure justice, the engineers organized what
</p>
<p>was then called the Brotherhood of the Foot Board.
</p>
<p>They hoped to have him removed but failed in this,
</p>
<p>but out of this society grew that noble institution, the
</p>
<p>Brotherhood of Engineers.
</p>
<p>About the year 1850 my work called me to run
</p>
<p>through a region infested with hundreds of desperate
</p>
<p>conspirators. At that time the Michigan Central was
</p>
<p>not fenced, the country was sparsely settled, and stock
</p>
<p>running wild in the woods would often get on the
</p>
<p>track and get killed, and the company would not pay
</p>
<p>the damage. After much bickering without result,
</p>
<p>the settlers along a stretch of about twenty miles unit-
</p>
<p>ed to commit depredations on the company's men and
</p>
<p>property. They would burn timber on the track, and
</p>
<p>throw stones at engines and trains, and would fire guns
</p>
<p>at passing engines, so that we sometimes had to lie
</p>
<p>down behind the driving wheel guards to keep from
</p>
<p>being shot. In the night they would run a hand car
</p>
<p>just before us for miles, to delay us. They burnt a
</p>
<p>freight house eight hundred feet long in Detroit, the
</p>
<p>upper part of which was for storing grain. After a
</p>
<p>year or so, the company sent men to join them, as
</p>
<p>spies, and to give information. A conspiracy was
</p>
<p>hatched to burn a very large elevator belonging to the
</p>
<p>company, at Niles. One of the spies, on being initiated,
</p>
<p>was ordered to burn that elevator and a railroad
</p>
<p>bridge. The damage was averted by the information

</p>
<p>474 TIIE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>The company was about two years preparing for
</p>
<p>its first trial in the courts, and then they arrested
</p>
<p>about forty men all in one day. They were men who
</p>
<p>professed to be our best friends; they had ridden free
</p>
<p>on our engines, times without number. Some of
</p>
<p>them were in the employ of the company; one of
</p>
<p>them was a fireman on one of our engines. Thev
</p>
<p>took a change of venue for obvious reasons, and ten
</p>
<p>of them went together to the state prison, which broke
</p>
<p>up the conspiracy. The attorneys who did a good
</p>
<p>work for the company, and for morals, were Mess.
</p>
<p>Van Annan and Darius Clark; both eminent in their
</p>
<p>profession.
</p>
<p>The Michigan Central was built from Detroit to
</p>
<p>Kalamazoo without any eastern outlet except the lake
</p>
<p>Erie. When navigation on the lake closed, in the
</p>
<p>fall, commerce was closed on the railroad. The en-
</p>
<p>gines were all laid up except enough to run two pas-
</p>
<p>senger and two freight trains. In my first winter I
</p>
<p>ran a freight, the next I ran a passenger train. Then
</p>
<p>the road was extended eastward through Canada to
</p>
<p>Niagara Falls, and there connected with the New
</p>
<p>York Central. I finally drifted west to the Burling-
</p>
<p>ton. That being a prairie road, there was but little
</p>
<p>wood along its line, but coal was abundant; the only
</p>
<p>trouble was that no one knew how to burn it, at least
</p>
<p>the method was very little known.
</p>
<p>At the Burlington shops in Aurora, was a man by
</p>
<p>the name of C. F. Jauriet, master mechanic of that
</p>
<p>road. I Ie was experimenting with coal burners, and
</p>
<p>he succeeded in making as nearly perfect a coal burn-

<p>reputation of being the best machinist in the country.
</p>
<p>His firebox to-day is the most economical of any
</p>
<p>that I know of. At his time they had to use copper
</p>
<p>for fireboxes, for they found that steel would crack,
</p>
<p>though at this writing steel is used. His box would
</p>
<p>last ten and twelve years. He could hold his engines
</p>
<p>on the road three to five years. He well deserved
</p>
<p>the title of master mechanic, yet he never had credit
</p>
<p>from his employers for his skill or his success, but he
</p>
<p>was severely criticized and censured as being expensive,
</p>
<p>and ignorance or willfulness in high places allowed
</p>
<p>him to resign. How much the company lost by allow-
</p>
<p>ing such a genius to leave their service can never be
</p>
<p>known.
</p>
<p>About this time coal was discovered on the line of
</p>
<p>the Michigan Central road near Jackson, Mich. It
</p>
<p>was pronounced unlit for use by Allen Sweet, master
</p>
<p>mechanic of that road. It so happened that while I
</p>
<p>was on a visit to Detroit, I saw Assistant Superintend-
</p>
<p>ent C. II. Ilurd, of the Michigan Central, and I asked
</p>
<p>him how he got along with his coal burners.* He said
</p>
<p>they were a failure, that the coal was no good. I
</p>
<p>then told Mr. Ilurd, that I had used some of the coal
</p>
<p>on the Burlington road, and found it superior instead
</p>
<p>of inferior as Mr. Sweet had stated. Superintendent
</p>
<p>Rice was informed of what I had said, and in a con-
</p>
<p>versation with him I suggested to him that he might
</p>
<p>exchange engines with the Burlington and get one of
</p>
<p>Mr. Jauriet's engines, which would very soon prove
</p>
<p>that I was right, that the fault was in the engines
</p>
<p>and not the coal. There had been a coal miners'

</p>
<p>got some of the Michigan coal, so I knew from ex-
</p>
<p>perience that it was good, but Mr. Sweet had agreed
</p>
<p>to run the road for less money than his predecessor,
</p>
<p>and he could not do so and change his engines into
</p>
<p>good coal burners, and he did everything he could to
</p>
<p>prevent the success of the demonstation. Shortly after
</p>
<p>my return home, I was sent for by Mr. Jauriet, as
</p>
<p>Superintendent Hammond of the Burlington had in-
</p>
<p>structed him to send one of his best coal burners to
</p>
<p>test some coal that they could not burn. Master
</p>
<p>Mechanic Sweet heard of this move and came to Au-
</p>
<p>rora to see Mr. Jauriet and try to exchange engines
</p>
<p>without having the engine manned by a Burlington crew,
</p>
<p>probably thinking he could defeat the test, but Mr.
</p>
<p>Jauriet would not allow his engines to be condemned
</p>
<p>that way, and engine 34, with engineer and fireman
</p>
<p>John Smith and Henry Twist was sent; as neither of
</p>
<p>them knew the road I was sent to show them, when
</p>
<p>I was to return. At Chicago they gave us twenty-
</p>
<p>five double deck cars of stock, and they run us to
</p>
<p>Marshall, Mich., nearly two hundred miles, then we
</p>
<p>took another train to Detroit, then commenced Mr.
</p>
<p>Sweet's effort to defeat the test. He had the engine
</p>
<p>sent to the dock, and the tank filled with dirty
</p>
<p>slacked coal, not a piece in it as large as a hickory
</p>
<p>nut. Engineer Smith naturally refused to go with
</p>
<p>such coal, as good coal was to be furnished. This refus-
</p>
<p>al brought Mr. Sweet who said: That's the same
</p>
<p>coal that I burn in my engines, and if you cannot
</p>
<p>burn the same you had better take your engine back
</p>
<p>home. I said, Mr. Sweet do you pretend to say that

<p>your engines will burn that coalr "Yes sir, I do."
</p>

</p>
<p>"I do not believe you can get steam enough with that
</p>
<p>coal to take your engine out of this yard." Mr.
</p>
<p>Sweet got very indignant, and said:" I want you to
</p>
<p>understand, you cannot come here and dictate to me
</p>
<p>what I shall burn in my engines. I will send you back
</p>
<p>home." He telegraphed to Chicago to have me re-
</p>
<p>called but they mistrusted what was the matter. An
</p>
<p>answer came to me, telling me to stay until further
</p>
<p>orders, and I staid until they were all satisfied the coal
</p>
<p>was good, which demonstrated the fact that Mr.
</p>
<p>Sweet, like many other officials, was working for him-
</p>
<p>self more than for the company.
</p>
<p>On my return to Aurora Mr. Jauriet sent me to
</p>
<p>Chicago to take charge of the engine house on Halsted
</p>
<p>street. I only staid there a short time. I longed for
</p>
<p>the free air of the prairies again, and on application
</p>
<p>for a change Floyd Cooly was sent to take my place
</p>
<p>and I went back on the road again.
</p>
<p>I would like in my story to mention the names of a
</p>
<p>few prominent railroad officials with whom I have had
</p>
<p>more or less business. Some of them are yet living at
</p>
<p>the time of this writing, September, 1889, and a good
</p>
<p>many are not.
</p>
<p>Edward H. Williams, once general manager ot the
</p>
<p>Chicago & Galena Union. He was familiarly known
</p>
<p>as Doctor Williams. He was a man with whom it is
</p>
<p>an honor to have been acquainted.
</p>
<p>John C. Gavitt w r as another, not only a gentleman,
</p>
<p>but a successful railroad manager.
</p>
<p>E. T. Jeffery, who was born, not with a silver spoon
</p>
<p>in his mouth, but w r ith a blackening brush in his hand.

<p>He is a skillful business man and a good judge of
</p>
<p>478 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>men. As a railroad manager he has no superior, and
</p>
<p>an v where he is a perfect gentleman.
</p>
<p>Thomas. J. Potter was another self-made man, of
</p>
<p>good judgment and of untiring industry. When he
</p>
<p>found that he could not agree with the general aims of
</p>
<p>a company, and could not change their plans, he would
</p>
<p>quietly and honorably retire with the good wishes and
</p>
<p>confidence of all parties.
</p>
<p>Godfrey W. Rhodes was superintendent of ma-
</p>
<p>chinery on the Burlington, a good business man, and
</p>
<p>in my opinion, a gentleman.
</p>
<p>Henry B. Stone, the undeviating promoter of the
</p>
<p>Burlington interest in the office of general manager,
</p>
<p>was always with me attentiye, polite, and cordial. I
</p>
<p>sincerely belieye that if he had been allowed to choose
</p>
<p>his own policy rather than be obliged to follow the
</p>
<p>dictates of the directors, the C, B. & Q. railroad would
</p>
<p>have a treasury richer, by millions, than it is to-day.
</p>
<p>Now, my clever reader, we have been friends to-
</p>
<p>gether for many a trip, and I mean to take you into
</p>
<p>my confidence and introduce you to my wife, Mrs. C
</p>
<p>M. Frisbie. As the age of a woman is always a secret
</p>
<p>I cannot tell you hers; but at this writing I am sixty-
</p>
<p>seven and it will take her ten years to get to the same
</p>
<p>point, but I'll never tell her age. I can tell a true story
</p>
<p>about my own little circle. One bright morning,
</p>
<p>thirty-nine years ago, a nice looking little youngster
</p>
<p>that had no age at all, came to my house and intro-
</p>
<p>duced himself as William W. Frisbie, the first of a
</p>
<p>series. He was very communicative, had a good deal
</p>
<p>of self-importance, but we took care of him, and at an

</p>
<p>early age we put him in charge of his father to become
</p>
<p>FORTY-SEVEN YEARS AN ENGINEER. 479
</p>
<p>an engineer. I took this youngster with me to lire
</p>
<p>when he was yet a lad, and we worked on the same
</p>
<p>truck for seven years. He is at this writing, running
</p>
<p>a passenger train from Topeka to Newton on the
</p>
<p>Santa Fe railroad, and he is still at his post. I al-
</p>
<p>ways taught him to shun saloons as he would vipers
</p>
<p>or scabs. I brought him up in the way he should go,
</p>
<p>and he went.
</p>
<p>Now, if we stop and look about us a little, we shall
</p>
<p>see wonderful changes since 1837, when you lust
</p>
<p>found me a boy of fifteen years. In that time, Queen
</p>
<p>Victoria reached the throne and has reigned during
</p>
<p>one half the period of the history of the United States.
</p>
<p>I was born in the administration of the fifth president
</p>
<p>of the United States, and of all our twenty-four presi-
</p>
<p>dents I have lived under twenty of them. In these
</p>
<p>forty-seven years of my engineering I never had a
</p>
<p>collision, but the engine of the general government
</p>
<p>has passed through fearful perils and met many an
</p>
<p>accident. We have had suspension of specie pay-
</p>
<p>ments; sudden deaths in high places; infamous assassi-
</p>
<p>nations; marvelous discoveries of gold and silver: vast
</p>
<p>out-puts of petroleum; great extension of domain ; many
</p>
<p>visits from impecunious princes of the earth, not
</p>
<p>omitting Kossuth with his $100,000 loan; brutal
</p>
<p>assaults within the federal buildings; the Dred Scott
</p>
<p>decision and Uncle Tom's Cabin, and the war that
</p>
<p>followed; the struggle between capital and labor; the
</p>
<p>nation embarrassed by its treasury surplus, and strikes
</p>
<p>without a parallel in their extent or in the intelligence
</p>
<p>with which emploves have demanded what they saw

<p>to be their rights.
</p>
<p>480 THE BURLINGTON STRIKE.
</p>
<p>And now we come to the great railroad strikes
</p>
<p>that since 1877 have made inter-state commerce so
</p>
<p>uncertain, and which, during 1888, threatened all
</p>
<p>railroad systems, and actually unsettled one of the
</p>
<p>largest of them. This is not properly the discussion
</p>
<p>of a biographer, but it requires the broader sweep of
</p>
<p>the pen of the historian. That is the subject of all
</p>
<p>this book. Here the individual is lost sight of and the
</p>
<p>subject of the general good commands the attention
</p>
<p>of all.
</p>
<p>Now, reader, come and see me; you will find my
</p>
<p>engine in the roundhouse, Aurora, Illinois, but the
</p>
<p>door is locked and the key is lost and I have plenty
</p>
<p>of time to talk. Bring your wife, or if vou have none,
</p>
<p>bring your best girl, and let us spin the past over
</p>
<p>again, and map out the future. But don't all come at
</p>
<p>once. And here I conclude my biography as David
</p>
<p>Crockett closed his: "Dear reader, I bid you farewell
</p>
<p>and, as the fox said to the coon, we will meet again at
