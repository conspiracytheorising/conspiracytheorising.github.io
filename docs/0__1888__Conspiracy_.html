<p>Scene 1.  Office of the Tribune.
</p>
<p>Greeley, Sturdy, Catcher, Clutcher, Trapper, Cunningham, and an attor-
</p>
<p>ney conversing, seated around a large table; Lawright at his desk.
</p>
<p>Trapper (taking the attornev aside). I am very glad,
</p>
<p>Mr. Smart, you have so promptly followed my request to
</p>
<p>be present here at the opening of the will of my late uncle.
</p>
<p>Indeed, I appreciate you as an eminent counsellor.
</p>
<p>Attorney. All my professional ability will be at your
</p>
<p>command.
</p>
<p>Clutcher (joining them). Ah, my friend, how do you
</p>
<p>feel as a prospective millionaire? Let me congratulate
</p>
<p>you on your good fortune as the only heir.
</p>
<p>Trapper. Thank yqu, sir; I am not so sure of that yet.
</p>
<p>My dear uncle ma}'^ have put some of his philanthropic
</p>
<p>ideas into practice to my sorrow. I have brought a friend
</p>
<p>with me here wlio will look after my interCvSt in this mat-
</p>
<p>ter. Allow me to introduce to you my friend and attor-
</p>
<p>ney, Mr. G. B. Smart.
</p>
<p>Clutcher. Precaution is always commendable; but you
</p>
<p>will be sure to come in for the lion's share under all cir-
</p>
<p>cum stances.
</p>
<p>Greeley (tapping on the table). Gentlemen, I have
</p>
<p>invited you to hear tlie reading of the will of our late

</p>
<p>friend Adam S. Goodwill, wlio lias chosen me executor.
</p>
<p>With your permission, I shall now proceed to open and
</p>
<p>read the document. (Reading) : " Whereas, I, the under-
</p>
<p>signed, Adam S. Goodwill, a citizen of New York, have,
</p>
<p>through diligence, hard work, and by the confidence of
</p>
<p>my fellow-citizens, been successful in business, and thereby
</p>
<p>accumulated a large fortune, consisting of real estate and
</p>
<p>bonds to the value of six million dollars, and being desi-
</p>
<p>rous of settling my worldl}^ affairs, declare this to be my
</p>
<p>last will and testament. It is my will and desire to dis-
</p>
<p>pose of said estate in the following manner: Four million
</p>
<p>dollars shall be used to found and to maintain a univer-
</p>
<p>sity in the State of New York, where students can gradu-
</p>
<p>ate free of charge. I devise to my nephew, Tom Trapper^
</p>
<p>the interest of the remaining two millions during his life,
</p>
<p>and upon the death of my said nephew and his wife and
</p>
<p>children, the said sum to revert to my estate to be used
</p>
<p>for the benefit of said university.
</p>
<p>Trapper (interrupting). It is an outrage.
</p>
<p>Greeley (continuing to read). " I request my beloved
</p>
<p>friend, Horace Greeley, who is also my executor, to read
</p>
<p>this, my last will and testament, in the presence of my
</p>
<p>business friends and associates, so that they may be
</p>
<p>prompted to follow my course, which I feel is the true
</p>
<p>spirit of philanthropy. I am fully aware that it is not by
</p>
<p>my own merits alone, but by the help and confidence of my
</p>
<p>fellow-men, that I have been enabled to accumulate so
</p>
<p>large a fortune, for which reason, I believe, that this prop-
</p>
<p>erty honestly belongs, and should revert to the public for
</p>
<p>the public good.
</p>
<p>" Witness my hand and seal the 1st day of March, 1871.
</p>
<p>"Adam S. Goodwill."
</p>
<p>Trapper. I am the rightful heir, and therefore I pro-
</p>

<p>will.
</p>
<p>Catcher. Right you are, young man ; protest. Such
</p>
<p>an idea of phihmthropy is too grand. All the money
</p>
<p>earned honestly b}^ one man must be returned to the pub-
</p>
<p>lic in general  what a justice to his heirs. God bless such
</p>
<p>great philanthropists!
</p>
<p>Clutcher. Great fools!
</p>
<p>Greeley. Gentlemen, our late friend, as a noble-hearted
</p>
<p>man and enlightened philosopher, who understood so well
</p>
<p>the spirit of the times, deemed it proper and wise to show
</p>
<p>in fact by his last will, that an individual aided and pro-
</p>
<p>tected in his education and accumulation by society, ought
</p>
<p>for that reason to return a part of his worldly goods for
</p>
<p>the benefit of society.
</p>
<p>Trapper. But I, being the only relative, should natu-
</p>
<p>rally have the right to claim the benefit of his becjuest.
</p>
<p>Clutcher. Certainly; it is every father's ambition to
</p>
<p>accumulate a fortune for his children, thereby securing
</p>
<p>them a higher standing in society.
</p>
<p>Greeley. [*I will say, however, that when a ftither
</p>
<p>starves the intellect of his children, in order to leave them
</p>
<p>a few hundred dollars more wealth at his death, he is
</p>
<p>justly regarded as the most mistaken of misers. No one
</p>
<p>able to earn bread has any moral right to eat without
</p>
<p>earning it ; the obligation to l)e industrious and useful is
</p>
<p>not invalidated by the possession of wealth, nor by the
</p>
<p>generosity of wealthy relatives.]
</p>
<p>Catcher. Now, gentlemen, mark the results of such
</p>
<p>philo.sophy. Tiiis doctrine means putting down all indi-
</p>
<p>viduals to one level; it means death to all efforts in the
</p>
<p>human race. What higher ambition can an intelligent
</p>
<p>worker have than to save from his earnings, grow rich
</p>

</p>
<p>and be a good citizen? The accumulation in one's hand
</p>
<p>througli large enterprises advances the industry of our
</p>
<p>country. Therefore, a so-called millionaire is always a
</p>
<p>benefactor to society ; he gives work to the poor, and sub-
</p>
<p>sistence to the people in general.
</p>
<p>Glutcher. I don't care a snap for other, people; I will
</p>
<p>make money for my benefit. I want millions, and will
</p>
<p>keep it for my family. I am on this track now, and
</p>
<p>would like to see the man who gets me off.
</p>
<p>Greeley (aside). [The mania for heaping up riches,
</p>
<p>though it has a ver}' material, tangible basis, outlives all
</p>
<p>rational motives and defies all sensible limitations.]
</p>
<p>Sturdy. Gentlemen, I also regard it my duty, like our
</p>
<p>late friend, Adam S. Goodwill, to bequeath to the public a
</p>
<p>part of my property. I will not hesitate to do it at once;
</p>
<p>the possession of wealth imposes duties upon the possessor.
</p>
<p>In the presence of you, my friends, I donate to the public
</p>
<p>the sum of one million dollars, to be used for the erection
</p>
<p>of a brown stone building in the center of our city. Fur-
</p>
<p>ther, one million dollars to constitute a fund for an insti-
</p>
<p>tution of education for our working people, free of charge;
</p>
<p>also a public library and reading rooms. (Turning to
</p>
<p>the attorney ): Mr. Smart, as you ha})pen to be present
</p>
<p>here on this occasion, I wish you would draw up the nec-
</p>
<p>essary document to incorporate this institution. (Address-
</p>
<p>ing the others again): My friends, I began mv business
</p>
<p>life as a poor toiler, thus I know how hard it is to save the
</p>
<p>first thousand dollars; but by good luck I got ahead of
</p>
<p>my laboring comrades, and may be considered now a very
</p>
<p>rich man  indej)endent in society. I never shall forget
</p>
<p>my less fort mate fellow-workingmen, and I am proud to
</p>
<p>be enabled to devote some of my wealth to the benefit of
</p>
<p>the working-people to lessen their struggle of life by
</p>
<p>founding an institution of education, which will, I hope,

</p>
<p>in the future, prove to be a good home for the toilers.
</p>
<p>Clutcher. Another crank !
</p>
<p>Catcher. Well, well; that is a great idea, to build an
</p>
<p>academy for paupers.
</p>
<p>Greeley. [ I believe that there need be and should be
</p>
<p>no paupers who are not infantile, idiotic, or disabled, and
</p>
<p>that civilized society pays more for the support of able-
</p>
<p>bodied pauperism than the necessary cost of its extirpa-
</p>
<p>tion. Hand and head must work together to accomplish
</p>
<p>great results ; the laborer must be intelligent and edu-
</p>
<p>cated.]
</p>
<p>Sturdy. I want to have it distinctly understood that I
</p>
<p>make this donation to m}' fellow-workingmen for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of aiding them to better their condition as much as
</p>
<p>possible, while I sincerely hope some future state of soci-
</p>
<p>ety will make millionaires and hopeless paupers an im-
</p>
<p>possibility.
</p>
<p>Catcher (emphatically). That would be communism,
</p>
<p>and you philanthropists are playing with sentiments
</p>
<p>which are dangerous to the safety of our community. If
</p>
<p>the masses ever get an understanding of your philan-
</p>
<p>thropy, societ}^ will turn into anarchy.
</p>
<p>Greeley. [The efficiency of human efforts is enor-
</p>
<p>mously, ruinousl}' diminished by social aiiareliy of to-day.
</p>
<p>Labor should be protected, not merely in this country,
</p>
<p>hut in all countries. The exce.ssive and fatal competition
</p>
<p>of capital with capital, sinew with sinew, privation with
</p>
<p>privation, to excel in cheapness of production, should be
</p>
<p>checked and bounded.]
</p>
<p>Clutcher. Pshaw! ever\^ man for himself, and the
</p>
<p>devil take the hindmost; that is my philosophy.
</p>
<p>Catcher (pathetic). I started in life depending upon
</p>
<p>my own merit only. That I have been successful beyond
</p>
<p>my deserts, perhaps is due to my temperance, industry,

</p>
<p>.and strict attention to mv own business. Since I was a
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>youth, I have been in the habit of employing in my
</p>
<p>various enterprises large numbers of persons ; I think, at
</p>
<p>times, as high as fifty thousand, distributing from two to
</p>
<p>three million dollars per month amongst the workers.
</p>
<p>This shows I am quite an expert in industrial affairs, and
</p>
<p>may know something about the social question. I da
</p>
<p>not believe much in theories, but I am practicing national
</p>
<p>economy, and the law of supply and demand is ni}' special
</p>
<p>study. All your philanthropical ideas are only phrases
</p>
<p>which will not enrich the world.
</p>
<p>Greeley. [ Political economy is the science which treats
</p>
<p>of the production and existence of wealth in a community;
</p>
<p>defines what is real wealth, and points out the means by
</p>
<p>which it may be increased and diffused. This science is
</p>
<p>yet in the first century of its recognized existence. It
</p>
<p>opens its eyes upon a world full of absurd regulations,
</p>
<p>vexatious restrictions, and pernicious monopolies, in-
</p>
<p>tended to enrich particular communities at the expense of
</p>
<p>mankind, and particular individuals at the expense of
</p>
<p>their respective communities. These restrictions it very
</p>
<p>properly treats and condemns. Having their origin in
</p>
<p>narrow and selfish views, men aimed formerly to advance
</p>
<p>the interest of a part, to the damage of the whole; of the
</p>
<p>few at the expense of the many. Thus, hostile lo the
</p>
<p>highest and broadest good, they stood condemned alike
</p>
<p>by enlightened policy and b}- a generous philanthropy.]
</p>
<p>Cunningham. Hem, hem ! this sounds more like a de-
</p>
<p>claration of principles of the new ])arty, the newest fad of
</p>
<p>the Tribune.
</p>
<p>Catcher. Yes, yes: that smacks of pure honesty  to
</p>
<p>offset our so-called corruption in political life.
</p>
<p>Sturdy. Every honest man feels disgusted with the
</p>
<p>corruption which predominates in our political partisan-
</p>
<p>ship of to-day. There need be and should be a thorough
</p>

<p>reform.
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>Cunningham. Ha, ha, ha! a new reform-party.
</p>
<p>Clutcher. I don't care about parties; I can buy them
</p>
<p>anyhow. My pohcy is the ahnighty dollar.
</p>
<p>Greeley. [Our forefathers built up this great republic
</p>
<p>to secure to all men alike, liberty and the pursuit of hap-
</p>
<p>piness, yet nine-tenths depend for a livelihood on the
</p>
<p>chance that one or more will at all times be ready to hire
</p>
<p>them or buy of them. One achievement of our age, the
</p>
<p>banishment of human chattelhood from our soil, seems
</p>
<p>now to have been worth all the requisite efforts, the agony
</p>
<p>and blood}^ sweat through w^hich it was accomplished.
</p>
<p>But another reform, not so palpably demanded by justice
</p>
<p>and humanity, yet equally conducive to the well-being of
</p>
<p>our race, presses hard on its heels, and insists, that we
</p>
<p>shall accord it instant and earnest consideration. It is
</p>
<p>the elevation of labor from the plane of drudgery and
</p>
<p>servility, to one of self-respect, self-guidance, and genuine
</p>
<p>independence.]
</p>
<p>Catcher. We are living now in the age of steam and
</p>
<p>iron ; there is no room for vague sentiments. In the
</p>
<p>struggle of life only the fittest will survive, and he, of
</p>
<p>course, is entitled to have the be.st of all good things. I
</p>
<p>regret, and think it is dangerous, that the Tribune, one of
</p>
<p>our most influential newspapers in the country, preaches
</p>
<p>to the masses such maudlin philosophy (with a sneer). I
</p>
<p>can imagine that fame and popularity will be showered
</p>
<p>by the people on the advocates of such broad and insinu-
</p>
<p>ating doctrines.
</p>
<p>Greeley. [Fame is va[)or; popularity an accident;
</p>
<p>riches take wings; the only earthly certainty is oblivion.
</p>
<p>No man can see what a day will bring forth, and those
</p>
<p>who cheer to-day will often curse to-morrow ; and yet I
</p>
<p>cherish the hope, that the journal that I projected and

<p>mouldered into forgotten dust, and that the stone which

<p>covers my ashes may bear to future eyes the still intelli-
</p>

</p>
<p>Sturdy ( aside ). The discussion is getting a little too
</p>
<p>animated now^ I had better interfere. (Turning to Gree-
</p>
<p>ley.) My dear friend Greeley, I must remind you that it
</p>
<p>is time to go to that meeting where you have promised to
</p>
<p>speak in favor of our new party.
</p>
<p>Greeley. That's so. Gentlemen, you will excuse me
</p>
<p>for leaving, as I will have to address a meeting. (Turn-
</p>
<p>ing to Sturdy.) My friend, will you accompany me?
</p>
<p>Sturdy. Certainly; I am on the committee of arrange-
</p>
<p>ments.
</p>
<p>Greeley (to the others again). I have still the hope
</p>
<p>that you will give the question we have discussed a more
</p>
<p>earnest consideration, to satisfy the wish of our late friend,
</p>
<p>Adam S. Goodwill.
</p>
<p>Attorney. In the interest of Mr. Trapper," the rightful
</p>
<p>heir, and whose legal adviser I have the honor to be, I
</p>
<p>must contest this will, and would ask to have a copy of
</p>
<p>that document.,
</p>
<p>Greeley. You may confer with my lawyer, who will
</p>
<p>bring this will before the Surrogate's Court for probate.
</p>
<p>(Going to Lawright, hands him a manuscript.) Mr. Law-
</p>
<p>right, please take this pa})er and see that this platform of
</p>
<p>the Liberal party is published in the next issue of the

<p>Tribune, and comment on it favorably.

<p>protection of our interests. We cannot afford to be ruled

<p>by idealistic nonsense of such weak sentimentalists as our
</p>
<p>highly esteemed editor of the Tribune.
</p>
<p>Clutcher. Hush ! don't give yourself away.' The office
</p>
<p>of the Tribune is hardly the proper place for talking over
</p>
<p>this matter, with the assistant editor as a listener.
</p>
<p>Catcher. Do not disturb yourself (speaking low, point-
</p>
<p>ing to Lawright). He will be all right, and by and by a
</p>
<p>tool in my hand, (Louder.) As to this office, I have a
</p>
<p>perfect right to act my own pleasure. Look here (hold-
</p>
<p>ing up some shares, that Lawriglit can see them). These
</p>
<p>shares, the basis upon which this educating newspaper,
</p>
<p>the Tribune, was founded many years ago, were foolishly
</p>
<p>left in the hands of the employees for their sole benefit;
</p>
<p>they ran up (piito high in value, but nevertheless I gath-
</p>
<p>ered them idl in. 1 tell you, it is a mighty good thing,
</p>
<p>this share business; it needs only money and manage-
</p>
<p>ment to get the control ot any concern.
</p>
<p>Lawright (meantime paying close attention to the con-
</p>
<p>versation, aside.) Just what I have suspected.
</p>
<p>Catcher. You will now understand. I have the con-
</p>
<p>trol of the Tribune, and will put a stop to this agitating
</p>
<p>tendency of a newspaper for social reform, universal broth-
</p>
<p>erhood, and other such communistic nonsense. You
</p>
<p>know the press of to-day is a great power  it influences
</p>
<p>and leads the masses; therefore, we might be interested in

<p>getting this power into our service.

<p>his pet hobby against a second term of our Chief Magis-

</p>
<p>campaign agents, stating that our friend Greeley will be
</p>
<p>chosen as Presidential candidate of this new Liberal party-
</p>
<p>Clutcher. You don't say.
</p>
<p>Catcher. I rather like that; he may pull down b}'^ his
</p>
<p>own weight. But how can his defeat be most striking?
</p>
<p>Lawright (showing some excitement, suddenly bursts
</p>
<p>out). If the Democrats nominate him also 
</p>
<p>Clutcher. Good gracious! What, by the rebels? That
</p>
<p>certainly would be his defeat forever.
</p>
<p>Law^right. I beg pardon ; I mean to say Democrats, as
</p>
<p>good citizens, would be likely to support such a noble
</p>
<p>character and able candidate as Greeley,
</p>
<p>Catcher (smilingly). Yes, yes, my young friend, if
</p>
<p>you can so bring it about that he accepts the nomination ;
</p>
<p>then, of course, when he goes into the campaign, you will
</p>
<p>be the editor of the Tribune.

</p>
<p>Cunningham (turning to Catcher and Clutcher). My
</p>
<p>great influence as a politician, you know, is suflicient to
</p>
<p>lead a part of these good Democrats to set Greeley up as a
</p>
<p>nominee for the Presidency in the coming campaign.

<p>Catcher. That will be your cue. (Taking his hat to

<p>Grace. My dear, good uncle, is it true what I have
</p>
<p>heard, that you will be the candidate for the next Presi-

</p>
<p>it. By running for such a high position there will be no

<p>end to the antagonistic assaults on your noble character

<p>from envious politicians ; your kind heart will suffer

<p>agony from all the cruel adversaries you may have to

<p>encounter. I am so afraid it is more than you can bear-

<p>Greeley. You little anxious girl, I do not mind such
</p>
<p>hardships ; any man who runs for a high public office
</p>
<p>subjects himself to a thorough investigation of all his ac-

<p>Greeley (interrupting). Children, don't quarrel about

<p>proposition.
</p>
<p>Lawright. You must consider it ; the voice of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple is calling you.
</p>
<p>Grace. The people is a great monster without any con-
</p>
<p>sideration.
</p>
<p>Greeley. Your love for me makes you speak thus;
</p>
<p>but, my dear child, the people are everything.
</p>
<p>Grace. Are not the people mostly led by politicians?
</p>
<p>Greeley. [A politician is a quack statesman, cunningly
</p>
<p>devoted to the promotion of party politics.]
</p>
<p>Lawright (with deliberation). The good spirit of the
</p>
<p>American people is now rising, and will quell all the cor-
</p>
<p>ruptive leadership of truckling politicians. Partisanship
</p>
<p>has had its day. The country wants a change; and every
</p>
<p>citizen knows that Horace Greeley will do the most good
</p>
<p>for the people in the highest position of our glorious
</p>
<p>Republic.
</p>
<p>Greeley. [It is a sophistry which supposes that he
</p>
<p>who would do good must put himself in a position where
</p>
<p>the power to do good will most probably attach to him.]
</p>
<p>Grace. That is just like you ; this is the expression of
</p>
<p>your noble heart. Oh, my uncle, dear, I am so proud of
</p>
<p>you !
</p>
<p>Lawright. But he who is a true representative of great
</p>
<p>principles  a teacher to the people, must sacrifice all per-
</p>
<p>sonal feelings  overcome untimely modesty  to take the
</p>
<p>leadership when the country appeals to him.
</p>
<p>Greeley. [Men, even the best, are frail and mutable.]
</p>
<p>Lawright. The founder of the Tribune, never.

</p>
<p>Greeley (nodding in affirmative), [It cannot be long

<p>before the g-reat capitalists, railroad, and other corpora-

<p>tions, will be found buying up whole States, like sheep in

<p>lawsuit, concerning the will of your late uncle, Adam S.
</p>
<p>Goodwill? I heard some good news here lately in regard
</p>
<p>to the matter; 1 hope it is true

<p>Trapper. Very glad, indeed; my lawyer assures me I

<p>shall undoubtedly gain my rights as the only heir. In a

<p>S. Goodwill's estate, valued at six million dollars.

</p>
<p>Catcher. Well, my friends, we have good cause to con-
</p>
<p>gratulate ourselves in regard to the past campaign, which
</p>
<p>turned into a brilliant victory on our side. The well
</p>
<p>known idealist and would-be social reformer, Horace
</p>
<p>Greeley, as the presidential candidate of this political com-
</p>
<p>bination of Democrats and Republicans, is defeated. This
</p>
<p>gay offspring of a new ])arty had a xevy short existence.
</p>
<p>Its leaders, the good-hearted, but impractical philanthro-
</p>
<p>pists, are now left in the cold to philosophize over their
</p>
<p>grand defeat; but our nominee of the Rejuiblican party,

<p>the re-elected president, once more rei)rescnts the head of

</p>
<p>Cunningham. Mr. Peter Sturdy, the distinguished phi-
</p>
<p>lanthropist and leading apostle of this defeated new party,
</p>
<p>is now taking a rest at his fine country seat, and Horace
</p>
<p>Greely, by his tremendous struggle for the presidency, is
</p>
<p>a broken-hearted man.
</p>
<p>Catcher. It serves them right, these sentimental re-
</p>
<p>formers, when they are foolish enough to put their fingers
</p>
<p>into our pie.
</p>
<p>Cunningham. Ha, ha, ha! All the talk about political
</p>
<p>reform  the boasting of party purification  is entirely
</p>
<p>hushed. Our political machine worked finely, did it not?
</p>
<p>Clutcher. Because I greased it so well ; it has cost me
</p>
<p>a great deal of money.
</p>
<p>Catcher. Nevertheless we have gained the point. There
</p>
<p>is no sentimentality in our policy; it is only a matter of
</p>
<p>business, and it will pay in full all our investments.
</p>
<p>Clutcher. That is all right; I am satisfied the way
</p>
<p>things are going on now.
</p>
<p>Catcher. From the Pacific coast to the Atlantic shores,
</p>
<p>from Maine to Texas, commerce will flourish, and we be
</p>
<p>benefited more than we ever have dreamed of before, if we
</p>
<p>are smart enough to push in the right direction. As prac-
</p>
<p>tical business managers we must at once take advantage
</p>
<p>of all the natural resources, the products of the soil, and
</p>
<p>wealth in land; we must combine and concentrate busi-
</p>
<p>ness, so that we can control autocratically all commerce
</p>
<p>and industry, Hhh c/pifal irill hecoiiie a giganiic power, and
</p>
<p>we shall reap the full benefit for our administrative talent
</p>
<p>and energies, ])y which we are entitled to become masters
</p>
<p>and actual rulers of society.
</p>
<p>Trapper. But the public will cry out, this is a gigantic
</p>
<p>monopoly, and will cry louder and louder, till at last they
</p>
<p>beoin to kick.
</p>
<p>Catcher. Never mind; the public may try to kick.

<p>Lawrigiit. Would not puljlic opinion rebel? It is a
</p>
<p>mighty power.
</p>
<p>Catcher. I suppose so, my young friend; but you, as
</p>
<p>an able member of the press can direct this public opin-
</p>
<p>ion, that its mighty power may serve us. (Taking a let-
</p>
<p>ter from his pocket). I have the pleasure to hand to you
</p>
<p>your aiipointment as editor-in-chief of our journal, to
</p>
<p>which position you have been elected by the new board of
</p>
<p>directors of the Tribune. You will, of course, be hand-
</p>
<p>somely compensated for 3^our able work. It also pleases
</p>
<p>me that I have been charged to transfer to you some of
</p>
<p>our shares. As the editor and a large stockholder you
</p>
<p>will not fail to watch with the greatest interest over this
</p>
<p>organ of public opinion. (Handing Lawright his letter
</p>
<p>of appointment).
</p>
<p>Cunningham (reading the Tribune, suddenly exclaims),
</p>
<p>Look here, gentlemen! there is published in this morn-
</p>
<p>ing's Tribune a card written by Horace Greeley announc-
</p>
<p>ing his return to the paper. What does that mean ?
</p>
<p>Clutcher (to Catcher). Have you not fixed that matter?
</p>
<p>CuNNiNCiHAM. I tliought he was excluded from the edi-
</p>
<p>torship of this paper?
</p>
<p>Catcher. He has excluded himself from that post,
</p>
<p>which you will understand wlien you have read what fol-
</p>
<p>lows next.
</p>
<p>Cunningham. Do you mean the article entitled "Crumhs
</p>
<p>of Comfort r
</p>
<p>Catcher. That's it.
</p>
<p>Clutcher (takes up also a copy of the Tribune). Let
</p>
<p>us see what that editorial says; I suppose it also is com-
</p>
<p>posed by our famous writer  Greeley.
</p>
<p>Catcher (to Lawright). This article shows your very
</p>
<p>clever pen. I was under the impression that Greeley had
</p>
<p>written it  just his vigorous style.

<p>Lawright. I inserted it to smooth the way, and give
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>him a chance to get out of all the trouble in which this
</p>
<p>lamented defeat for the Presidency has put him.
</p>
<p>Catcher (aside). The devil ! how smart. That fellow
</p>
<p>beats me.
</p>
<p>Cunningham (angry). To hell with that old crank,
</p>
<p>Greeley, for publishing such an impertinent article! I am
</p>
<p>not sorry now to have been unscrupulous in my helping
</p>
<p>to defeat him. Here he says (reading): " Every red-nosed
</p>
<p>politician who had cheated at the caucus and fought at
</p>
<p>the polls looked to the editor of the Tribune to secure his
</p>
<p>appointment as a ganger, or as army chaplain, or as Min-
</p>
<p>ister to France. Every campaign orator came upon us
</p>
<p>after the battle was over for a recommendation as Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of the Treasury, or the loan of half a dollar."
</p>
<p>Clutcher (laughing). That's very good ; that's a cap-
</p>
<p>ital joke !
</p>
<p>CuNNiNCiHAM. That is an outrage, an insult to me, and
</p>
<p>all other politicians as well. Further, he goes on to say
</p>
<p>(reading again) : "At last we shall keep our ofhce clear of
</p>
<p>blatherskites and political beggars." (Throwing the paper
</p>
<p>down.) Now I am satisfied that we luive cleared him out
</p>
<p>of this office.
</p>
<p>Trapper. I consider this article most insulting to his
</p>
<p>own political allies and followers.
</p>
<p>Catcher. The power of his influence over the Ameri-
</p>
<p>can people is ended  he is but a broken man.
</p>
<p>LawriCtHT. But he is quite vigorous enough to make us
</p>
<p>a lively scene here. I expect him in every minute.
</p>
<p>Clftcher (anxious). What; he will be here in a mo-
</p>
<p>ment?
</p>
<p>Lawright (to Catcher). Judging from the note he sent
</p>
<p>me, I anticipate he wants an explanation al)()ut that in-
</p>
<p>serted article, "Crumbs of Comfort."

<p>Trapper. I do not like the idea of meeting the old man
</p>
<p>just, now, when I am not prepared to answer all his aggra-
</p>
<p>vating questions about the contest of my uncle's will.
</p>
<p>Cunningham. It might be dangerous for that great
</p>
<p>statesman if I should meet him at this moment. I am
</p>
<p>not sure that I could control my anger, and I would not
</p>
<p>like to kick a man who is already down.
</p>
<p>Catcher. I hardly think I could enjoy an interview
</p>
<p>with Horace Greeley at this time; but I will say this much
</p>
<p>(to Lawright), don't be bulldozed; remember you are the
</p>
<p>chief of this otfice now.

</p>
<p>Lawright. What miserable cowards! They fight for
</p>
<p>Mammon and power, but have not the courage to meet a
</p>
<p>mail. (Repeating Catcher's advice) : " Remember you are
</p>
<p>chief of this' office now." Certainly; I have gained at
</p>
<p>once all my aspirations. But, to face the truth  I am
</p>
<p>only a tool in the hands of these monopolists, to forge
</p>
<p>public opinion in their favor. Thus these clever business
</p>
<p>managers may proceed unmolested in their gambling,
</p>
<p>greedy grabbing, and accumulation of other people's
</p>
<p>money. Must I confront old Greeley? Oh, my God!
</p>
<p>Ha ! would it not be much better for me to tell him the
</p>
<p>whole story? How infamously he has been betrayed? I
</p>
<p>will help him with all my force, in defiance of these foes,
</p>
<p>to unfold, to raise up again his noble banner of principles.
</p>
<p>No, no, it is too late ! the result would only be a fight in
</p>
<p>the dark. The facts are, his paper, the Tribune, is cap-
</p>
<p>tufed, and in a short time the whole press of the country

</p>
<p>Gradually I shall loosen their grip, and some day be my

<p>own master. I have grit enough to understand any situ-
</p>
<p>ation. (With a sigh.) Alas! poor Grace; the look of re-
</p>
<p>proach in her soft sad eyes haunts me everywhere. Ah,
</p>
<p>me; pshaw! she is only a woman; temperament like April
</p>
<p>weather  no danger from her. I cannot imagine how she
</p>
<p>could love me anyhow. If I had only something to accuse

<p>her of; some shadow of a cause for breaking our engage-

<p>Grace. Harry, tell me what is the matter? Uncle is
</p>
<p>wild. This morning, while reading his paper, he sudden-
</p>
<p>ly accused you of overlooking the insertion of a certain
</p>
<p>article in the Tribune, which is slanderous and blacken-
</p>
<p>ing his good name. Oh, say; what does it mean? How
</p>
<p>could you overlook that.
</p>
<p>IjAwright. Oh, I guess your uncle is only nervous;
</p>
<p>affected by his loss of the Presidency.
</p>
<p>Grace. Uncle, nervous? not at all; he is in excellent
</p>
<p>health, in the most animated spirits; he does not mind
</p>
<p>his defeat, and will again resume the editorial control of

<p>the Tribune.

<p>Laavrtght. Because his defeat for the Presidency may
</p>
<p>somewhat interfere with his assuming the editorship again.

<p>PubHc opinion, you know, is a fickle, changeable maid,
</p>
<p>always following the train of success.
</p>
<p>Grace (perplexed). Impossible! you did not speak like

<p>that before; you were the very one to persuade him to ac-
</p>
<p>cept the nomination. Oh, I begin to understand ; my pre-
</p>
<p>monition conies true. Harry, what shall I think of you?
</p>
<p>Lawright (cool). Circumstances alter cases.
</p>
<p>Grace. Mr. Lawright, what are you insinuating with
</p>
<p>such phrases? Am I to ap[)ly this to our relations also?
</p>
<p>Lawright. I should be very sorry to pain you, Miss

</p>
<p>pregnable enemy of the liberties and the happiness of man

<p>city, founded and built up a daily newspaper, in which
</p>
<p>alone lie all my hopes and ambition. [ My aim was to
</p>
<p>make it a journal that should express its editor's convic-
</p>
<p>tions forcibly and fearlessly, should be liberal without in-
</p>
<p>difference, and open to the reception and recognition of
</p>
<p>truth. I will make this paper now a thoroughly indepen-
</p>
<p>dent journal, treating all parties and political movements
</p>
<p>with judicial fairness and candor, but courting the favor
</p>
<p>and deprecating the wrath of no one]  but the devil I

<p>(Taking up a paper.) What heinous being could insert
</p>
<p>in this, my journal, such an article, with the caption
</p>
<p>"Crumbs of Comfort," as coming from myself? It is the
</p>
<p>most infernal lie; doing me the grossest wrong. It puts
</p>
<p>me in a false light, as though I could insult the public
</p>
<p>and my best friends.
</p>
<p>(Lawright making a motion; Greeley then just noticing
</p>
<p>Lawright's presence).
</p>
<p>Greeley. Ah, Mr. Lawright; I sup])0se you received
</p>
<p>my note about the repudiation of this infamous article,
</p>
<p>" Crumbs of Comfort." How could such an insinuation
</p>
<p>creep into our last issue without your knowledge? [This
</p>
<p>article is a monstrous fable, based on some other experience
</p>
<p>than that of an}^ editor of this journal]. I want my dis-
</p>
<p>claimer printed at once, to justify myself against such in-
</p>
<p>famy.
</p>
<p>(Lawright, shrugging his shoulder, gives no answer.)
</p>
<p>Greeley (impatient). What is the matter with you?
</p>
<p>Can you not understand? I am obliged to defend myself
</p>
<p>against the insinuation of this miserable wretch, who has
</p>
<p>dared to blacken my good name before the public.

<p>-author of this hideous article; now I despise this man.

<p>claimer.
</p>
<p>Greeley. What? did I hear you right? you say you
</p>
<p>refuse. I demand, as the editor-in-chief, that my orders
</p>
<p>be obeyed. You will understand that.
</p>
<p>Lawright. You luive been the editor; at present, lam
</p>
<p>the cliicf of this office. (Handing to Greeley his letter of
</p>
<p>appointment.) This will inform you of the position I
</p>
<p>now occupy.

<p>Greeley (glancing over the letter, reading) : "Mr. H,
</p>
<p>Lawright, the board of trustees of the Tribune concern in-
</p>
<p>forms you that you are unanimously elected the editor-in-
</p>
<p>chief of our daily journal, the Tribune." (Greeley stag-

<p>those trustees; who have signed this letter? (Looking at

<p>the signatures)  T. C. Clutcher, H. J. Catcher  (Dropping

<p>the letter.) What a terrible blow! These monopolists-

<p>these money-mongers; have laid a most fiendish trap to

<p>undo the good work of a whole life's energy; they have

<p>robbed me of the Tribune  the pride of my life; the fruit

<p>nal, was an obstacle in their way. [They have an in-

</p>
<p>and brotherhood ; the fundamental guarantee for the hap-
</p>
<p>piness of every human being will be trodden down by
</p>
<p>these worshippers of the golden calf. The education and
